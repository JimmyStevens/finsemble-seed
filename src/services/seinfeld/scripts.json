        "text": "          GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS  Written by   Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld  (Comedy club) JERRY  You know, why we're here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about \"We should go out\"? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. (imitates one of these people \"tryin' to find us\"; pretends his hand is a phone) \"Did you ring?, I can't find him.\" (imitates other person on phone) \"Where did he go?\" (the first person again) \"He didn't tell me where he was going\". He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go: \"We gotta be getting back\". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.   (Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a table.)  JERRY  Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. (talking about George's shirt) The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.  GEORGE  Are you through? (kind of irritated)  JERRY  You do of course try on, when you buy?  GEORGE  Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.  JERRY  Oh, you don't recall? GEORGE  (pretends he's talking into a microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.  JERRY  Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. (a waitress approaches the table)  WAITRESS  Mister Seinfeld. (she pours coffee in his cup) Mister Costanza. (she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her)  GEORGE  Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?  WAITRESS  It's missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. (ironically)  JERRY  Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.  WAITRESS  Trust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. (she pours the coffee and walks away)  GEORGE  How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?  JERRY  Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.  GEORGE  Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?  JERRY  I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?  GEORGE  No, you didn't! JERRY  I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...(looks in the milk can) There's no milk in here, what...  GEORGE  Wait wait wait, what is she, (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) what is she like?  JERRY  Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.  GEORGE  (with a big smile) So, ya know, what, what happened?  JERRY  Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but it was great.  GEORGE  Oh, nothing happened, but it was...  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  This is great! JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!  JERRY  Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.  GEORGE  (whistles disapproving) Ho ho ho, \"Had to\"? \"Had to come in\"?  JERRY  Yeah, but... GEORGE  \"Had to come in\" and \"maybe we'll get together\"? \"Had to\" and \"Maybe\"?  JERRY  Yeah! GEORGE  No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna see this woman.  JERRY  (indignant) What, are you serious...why, why did she call?  GEORGE  How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.  JERRY  To be polite? You are insane! GEORGE  All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?  JERRY  Yes! GEORGE  You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!  JERRY  Oh, I get it, this is about the button.  GEORGE  (The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block) Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?  CLAIRE  What gave it away, George? GEORGE  Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.  JERRY  (to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?  GEORGE  (to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to (makes some gestures to accent \"has to\") come to New York on business...  JERRY  Oh you are beautiful! (ironically)  GEORGE  and, and maybe (again some gestures) she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?  CLAIRE  I'd have to say: uuhh, no. (George shows his note-block to Jerry, it says very largely: NO)  GEORGE  (to Claire) So why did she call? CLAIRE  To be polite. GEORGE  To be polite, I rest my case. JERRY  Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me (stands up), I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.  GEORGE  I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.  JERRY  Oh, come on, be a \"come-with-guy\".  GEORGE  Come on, I'm tired. CLAIRE  (to Jerry) Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he'll perk up.  GEORGE  (takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics) Right, I knew I felt something...! (Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away with a smile)   (Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers)  GEORGE  Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced. (walks away from the dryer; a man passes George and Jerry)  JERRY  Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.  GEORGE  I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...  JERRY  And you didn't even hear how she sounded.  GEORGE  What?! JERRY  Laura. GEORGE  I can't believe: (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!  JERRY  Yeah, but how could you be so sure?  GEORGE  (gets up) 'Cause it's signals, Jerry (starts snapping his fingers), it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?  JERRY  No. GEORGE  She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  What is that? It's ridiculous! (Jerry bobs agreeingly) You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! (snaps his fingers again) Signal!  JERRY  Maybe you're right. GEORGE  Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.  JERRY  This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.  GEORGE  (puts an arm around Jerry and whispers) I know, I know. (normal voice) Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?  JERRY  No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.  GEORGE  You're gonna \"overdry\" it. JERRY  You, you can't \"overdry\". GEORGE  Why not? JERRY  Same as you can't \"overwet\". (George looks puzzled) You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't \"overdie\", you can't \"overdry\".  GEORGE  (looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to them pointing to Jerry) Any questions?  JERRY  How could she not tell me where she was staying? (George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops working and George closes the lid)  GEORGE  (points to the dryer) Look at that: they're done! It's a miracle! (Jerry looks surprised)   (Comedy club) JERRY  \"Laundry-day\" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: \"C'mon babe, let's gather\". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll: (shows how clothes are acting when you open the lid)...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: (sock's voice) \"Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!\" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road (shows how the sock is going down the road). They got buttons sewed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughta get the harpoon out your chest first.   (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching TV) JERRY  (The phone rings. He picks it up and says:) If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no (somebody knocks at the door) Yeah? (to the door, while still at the phone)  KRAMER  (enters) Are you up? JERRY  (To Kramer) Yeah...(in the phone) Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem (hangs up the phone).  KRAMER  Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?  JERRY  (upset) Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! (actually I can't understand the name; maybe \"Kramer\" wasn't named \"Kramer\" in the pilot!) I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.  KRAMER  Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...(takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets) You got any meat?  JERRY  (a little irritated) Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! (Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in) Well what, what happened in the game anyway?  KRAMER  (still with his head in the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! (takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it) Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.  JERRY  (cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!  KRAMER  Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him with a \"what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look\" and Kramer asks:) Are you done with this?  JERRY  No. KRAMER  (glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table) When you're done, let me know.  JERRY  Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.  KRAMER  I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.  JERRY  No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.  KRAMER  You want me to talk to her? JERRY  I don't think so. KRAMER  Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. (shows with his fingers how close it was)  JERRY  That close, huh? KRAMER  You better believe it. (The phone rings. Jerry picks it up)  JERRY  Hello...Oh, hi, Laura. KRAMER  Give me it...let me talk to her (continues this way).  JERRY  (gestures Kramer to shut up) No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me...(Kramer suddenly notices something in the Mets-game on TV)...  KRAMER  A SLIDE!...Wow! JERRY  ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it (takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on) ten-fifteen...No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. (hangs up the phone; to Kramer:) I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!   (Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy mattress)  JERRY  If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (talks from now on like he has a cigarette in his mouth) Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.  GEORGE  Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? (sits down)  JERRY  (hands George a beer) Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.  GEORGE  All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?  JERRY  All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...  GEORGE  A decent hotel-room... JERRY  Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.  GEORGE  You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? (waves with his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!  JERRY  (cynical) This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?  GEORGE  I think I was affected by the caffeine. (suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch) HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG (etc.)  KRAMER  (walks in behind the dog and closes the door) He really likes you, George.  GEORGE  (ironically) Well, that's flattering.  KRAMER  (the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking from the toilet) Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. (sees the mattress on the floor) Is this for that girl?  JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Why even give her an option? JERRY  This is a person I like, it's not: \"How to score on spring break\".  GEORGE  Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.  JERRY  Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.  GEORGE  So what? That's good. JERRY  Now, how could that be good? GEORGE  Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over: \"I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.  JERRY  This is how you operate? GEORGE  Yeah, I wish. JERRY  Let me just wipe the sink. KRAMER  (stands up from the couch and yells.) WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? (Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; to George, while pointing to the mattress) It's unbelievable.  GEORGE  Yeah. KRAMER  ...How's the real estate-business?  GEORGE  ...(surprised he asked) It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.  KRAMER  Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?  GEORGE  Well, I might be getting in to that.  KRAMER  (slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!  GEORGE  I'm aware of you, all right, let's go (opens the bathroom door), let's go! (Jerry and the dog come out) You're on stage in 25 minutes.   (Comedy club.) JERRY  The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: \"I could use a cotton-ball right now\"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: \"Let's move on\"... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know: \"Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?\".   (Airport. Jerry and George are waiting for Laura) JERRY  Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?  GEORGE  What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.  JERRY  Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.  GEORGE  Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.  JERRY  Really? How? GEORGE  'Cause it's all in the greeting. JERRY  Uh-huh. GEORGE  All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.  JERRY  Right. GEORGE  Ya know, anything in the, in the \"lip-area\" is good.  JERRY  \"Lip-area\". GEORGE  Ya know a hug: definitely good. JERRY  Hug is definitely good. GEORGE  Sure. JERRY  Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?  GEORGE  That's so brutal, I hate that. JERRY  Ya know how they do that? GEORGE  That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.  JERRY  Shake is bad, but what if it's the \"two-hander\"? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?  GEORGE  Hand-sandwich. JERRY  Right. GEORGE  I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...(suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry's eyes)  LAURA  Guess who? JERRY  Hey, hey. LAURA AND JERRY  Heeeey! (they take each others hands like they're planning to do a folk dance; George is looking puzzled)  JERRY  It's good to see you. LAURA  Hi. JERRY  This is my friend George. LAURA  (shakes George's hand) Hi, how nice to meet you.  GEORGE  Hi, how are you? JERRY  This is Laura. GEORGE  Laura, sure. JERRY  (to Laura) I can't believe you're here.  GEORGE AND JERRY  Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. (they pick up the bags)  LAURA  Oh, thank you. JERRY  (privately to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?  GEORGE  Yes, the \"surprise-blindfold-greeting\". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.   (Jerry's apartment. Jerry shows Laura the apartment) JERRY  So uh, what do ya think? LAURA  Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.  JERRY  Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?  LAURA  (laughs) Actually uhm, do you have any wine?   JERRY; Uh, yeah, I think I do. LAURA  Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? (points to the lamp)  JERRY  Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. (she turns down the lamp)  LAURA  Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wondering: would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?  JERRY  Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?  LAURA  No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.  JERRY  Really? What would you like to do?  LAURA  Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.  JERRY  (doubtfully) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pours the wine) I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. (the phone rings; he picks it up) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Uhm, it's for you.  LAURA  (she takes the phone) Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, bye (she hangs up the phone). Never get engaged.  JERRY  You're engaged? LAURA  You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.  JERRY  You're engaged? (still can't believe it)  LAURA  Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of \"we\", uh, it's a very stressful situation.  JERRY  You're engaged! (like he's answering his own question)  LAURA  Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy... JERRY  Yeah. LAURA  You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on that boat.  JERRY  Me too!  (Comedy club.) JERRY  I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks: (imitates horn).  THE END >",

        "text": "    THE STAKE OUT Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld (Opening comedy) JERRY  So, I'm on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of   them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both   of course choose to pay by the use of the (pause and gesture to audience   for response) AUDIENCE  Cheque JERRY  Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it's a woman in front of you that's   writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that   women are very *fast* with cheques, y'know, 'cuz they write out so many   cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don't know   where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for   book from an imaginary holster) ``Who do I make it out to?... There's my   ID...''. There's something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine.   I don't know exactly what it is... I think to a man, a cheque is like a note   from your mother that says ``I don't have any money, but if you'll   contact these people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me... If you   just trust me this one time I don't have any money but I have   these... I wrote on these; is this of any value at all?''  (End stand-up) JERRY  What's that one? ELAINE  \"Coccoon II: The Return\". I guess they didn't like it up there...  JERRY  Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y'know Maureen Stapleton, if   she gets a craving, she's probably screamin' at those aliens, \"I gotta have a Lo mein!\" ELAINE  Okay, what're we doing here? I have seen *everything*.  JERRY  Oh yeah? I don't believe you've seen... this.  ELAINE  Oh, lovely... JERRY  Yeah... ELAINE  What do you think their parents think?  JERRY  \"So, uh, what's your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?\"   \"Oh, he's a public fornicator. Yes, he's a fine boy...\" ELAINE  Y'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela's   birthday. JERRY  Pamela? Do I know her? ELAINE  Yeah, you met her when we were going out.  JERRY  Oh yeah, right... ELAINE  You have *no* idea who I'm talking about, do you?  JERRY  (quickly) No. ELAINE  Blonde hair remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you *totally* blocked   out the entire time we were a couple? JERRY  Riverside Drive. ELAINE  Right! In fact... No, never mind...  JERRY  Well, what is it? ELAINE  Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some   bar for her birthday, but... you don't want to go to... that... no.  JERRY  Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.  ELAINE  What little deal? JERRY  I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I   have on Saturday. ELAINE  A *wedding*!? Have you *lost* it, man?  JERRY  Y'know, my parents are coming in for this...  ELAINE  They're coming in? JERRY  Yeah, tomorrow. ELAINE  Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?  JERRY  No, no... Still doin' the big *sweep* across.  ELAINE  Why does he do that? JERRY  Doesn't think anyone can tell? JERRY  So c'mon, do we have a deal? ELAINE  A *wedding*? JERRY  There's a lot of people to mock...  ELAINE  Alright, what the Hell. JERRY  Great! WOMAN  When you're dead, you're dead. That's it. You're not goin'   anywhere... ELAINE  C'mon lets go, c'mon... JERRY  Was I supposed to bring something?  ELAINE  You could have. JERRY  I met her *one* time... ELAINE  It is not necessary. JERRY  What did you say then? ELAINE  Sssshhhhhh!!! PAMELA  Hi ELAINE  Hi Pamela, you remember Jerry. PAMELA  Yes, we met. JERRY  Hi, happy birthday. PAMELA  Ahh, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry.  GUESTS  Hi JERRY  I didn't bring anything. PAMELA  Ahh, I put you two right here. JERRY  Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) I'm sorry, I didn't know what   to bring, nobody told me. VANESSA  How big a tip do you think it'd take to get him to stop?  JERRY  I'm in for five... VANESSA  I'll supply the hat. JERRY  (To himself) Uh-oh... What do we have here...  VANESSA  Why don't you relax and take your jacket off?  JERRY  Oh, I can't-- I have a tendency to get chilly.  VANESSA  How masculine... JERRY  Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my tattoos.   (To himself) She's unbelievable! ROGER  (To Vanessa) Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker...  VANESSA  Oh, you know Bricker! From where? JERRY  (To himself) What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she's   too good to be alone... What's the difference, I can't maneuver   anyway with Elaine next to me... VANESSA  (To Jerry) How do you know Pamela?  JERRY  Friend of a friend. And you? VANESSA  We went to law school together. ELAINE  Oh, Jerry! JERRY  (To himself) Oh no, not *now*... ELAINE  I had this dream last night and you were in it.  JERRY  Oh really... (To himself) Oh God, I gotta get out of this...  ELAINE  You were you, but, you weren't you...  JERRY  No kidding... (To himself) Why is this happening? Please, make   her stop! ELAINE  I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were   standing there, you were looking out the window-- JERRY  (To himself) This is *brutal*... ELAINE  You turned around and you had these wooden teeth...  JERRY  How do you like that... (To himself) Can I turn now? Is this   over? No, I can't, I can't... I'm stuck... ELAINE  Jerry? Are you listening to me? JERRY  Yes, I *heard* you. PAMELA  Elaine, what's the name of that jewelry store you took me to that   time? JERRY  (To himself) Thank *you*, Pamela! JERRY  (To Vanessa) So, you're a lawyer...  VANESSA  Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.  JERRY  (To himself, quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.   Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft...  (To Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit!  VANESSA  Oh, that was you! JERRY  Imagine, spelling \"Mom\" with two O's...  VANESSA  Very funny! What do you do? JERRY  Comedian. VANESSA  Really... That explains it... JERRY  (To himself, quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.   Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. ROGER  Are you ready? VANESSA  We gotta run. Happy birthday! JERRY  (To himself) I can't believe it-- I got *nothing*! I don't even   know her name! JERRY  (To himself, *very* quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and   Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag... JERRY  That wasn't so bad, really... ELAINE  Y'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners.  JERRY  Why? What did I do? ELAINE  Well, I just don't appreciate these little \"courtesy responses\",   like I'm selling you aluminum siding. JERRY  I was listening! ELAINE  No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... \"conversation\".  JERRY  No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.  ELAINE  Uh-huh... JERRY  Where you had, uh, wooden teeth. ELAINE  No! No! *You* had wooden teeth! *You* had wooden teeth! *I*   didn't have wooden teeth, *you* did! JERRY  Alright, so *I* had wooden teeth, so what?  ELAINE  So nothing... Nothing... JERRY  Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic   relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after   himself. He said ``Yeah, I got this new thing-- \"platonic\". My   idea, my name, callin' it after myself... What I do is, I go *out*   with the girls, I *talk* with them-- don't *do* anything... and go   right home. What'dya think? I think it's going to be *big*!''   I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get   relationships named after them, but it didn't work. Y'know, I bet   Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it's a  *\"Riconic\"* relationship...'' JERRY  Hey! MORTY  Ah, there he is! JERRY  This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your   bed! HELEN  Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this...  JERRY  What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you here...  HELEN  Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel. JERRY  Ma, will you stop? HELEN  No, why should we take over your apartment?  JERRY  I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.  HELEN  Your friend Kramer doesn't mind? JERRY  No, he's making a bouillabaisse. JERRY  So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big   law offices? MORTY  Depends on the firm. JERRY  Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they   would know who it was? MORTY  What's the matter? You need a lawyer?  JERRY  No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I   don't know her name. MORTY  So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?  JERRY  Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask her.  HELEN  Why not? JERRY  Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.  HELEN  He used to go with her... HELEN  Which one is she? MORTY  From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered   cherries you didn't like. MORTY  Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person. JERRY  Oh yeah, she's great. HELEN  So, how come nothing materialized there?  JERRY  Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno...  HELEN  I know what it was... JERRY  You don't know what it was... HELEN  So, what was it? JERRY  Well, we fight a lot for some reason...  H + M  Oh, well... JERRY  And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...  HELEN  Well, I think she's a very attractive girl.  JERRY  Oh, she is, she absolutely is. HELEN  I can see if there was a *weight* problem...  JERRY  No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided.  HELEN  You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect.  JERRY  I know, I know... MORTY  Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular.  HELEN  Idiot... (To Jerry) So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren?  JERRY  That's got *nothin'* to do with it.  MORTY  How about Loni Anderson? HELEN  Where do you get Loni Anderson? MORTY  Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson?  HELEN  I like *Elaine* more than Loni Anderson...  JERRY  What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't \"the one\".  HELEN  And this other one's \"the one\"? JERRY  I dunno, maybe... MORTY  So ask Elaine there for the number.  JERRY  I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women with her,   especially this one tonight. HELEN  How could you still see her if your not interested?  JERRY  We're *friends*. MORTY  Doesn't sound like you're friends to me. If you were friends you'd   ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?  JERRY  Oh yeah... MORTY  Well, go up to the office. HELEN  Up to her office? MORTY  Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?  JERRY  I guess... MORTY  So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to   come down for lunch. JERRY  You mean \"stakeout\" the lobby? HELEN  Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!  MORTY  He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number.  HELEN  So you've got him standing by the elevator like a *dope*! What   happens when he sees her? MORTY  He pretends he *bumped* into her! JERRY  Y'know what? This is *not* that *bad* an idea...  GEORGE  What does she look like? JERRY  I dunno. Hard to say. GEORGE  What actress does she remind you of?  JERRY  Loni Anderson. GEORGE  Loni Anderson?! JERRY  What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson?  JERRY  Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.  GEORGE  Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides, you think   I wanna miss this? JERRY  I'm a little nervous. GEORGE  Yeah, me too... JERRY  If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?  GEORGE  You came to see me; I work in the building.  JERRY  What do you do? GEORGE  I'm an *architect*. JERRY  You're an *architect*? GEORGE  I'm not? JERRY  I don't see architecture comin from you...  GEORGE  I suppose *you* could be an architect...  JERRY  I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else...  GEORGE  Alright, she's not even gonna ask, if we *see* her, which is remote.  JERRY  Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!  GEORGE  We're having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building.  JERRY  What is *his* name? GEORGE  Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.  JERRY  Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.  GEORGE  No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr.....  JERRY  Art Corr... GEORGE  ...velay... JERRY  Corvelay? GEORGE  Yeah, right. JERRY  Well, what does *he* do? GEORGE  He's an importer. JERRY  Just imports, no exports? GEORGE  He's an importer/exporter, okay? GEORGE  Say, did Elaine ever call you back?  JERRY  No, I guess she's still mad. GEORGE  I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?  JERRY  Never. JERRY  Wait a second... That's her... on the right.  GEORGE  I forgot who I am! Who am I?! JERRY  You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay.  GEORGE  Vandelay! JERRY  Corvelay! GEORGE  Let me be the architect, I can do it!  JERRY  Hey, hey... Pamela's birthday party, didn't I see you there...   Jerry. VANESSA  Sure! Hi! JERRY  This is George. (\"Grasps\" for her name) I'm sorry...  VANESSA  Vanessa. GEORGE  Nice to meet you. JERRY  Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.  VANESSA  That's right! What're you doing here?  JERRY  Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the   building. GEORGE  Yeah, Art *Vandelay*. VANESSA  Really? Which company? JERRY  I don't know. He's an importer. VANESSA  Importer? GEORGE  ...And exporter. JERRY  He's an importer/exporter. GEORGE  I'm, uh, I'm an architect. VANESSA  Really. What do you design? GEORGE  Uh, railroads, uh... VANESSA  I thought engineers do that. GEORGE  They can... JERRY  Y'know I'm sorry you had to leave so early the other night.  VANESSA  Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.  JERRY  Oh, that guy was your *cousin*! VANESSA  Yeah, and that woman was your-- JERRY  Friend! GEORGE  I'll just, uh, get a paper... JERRY  So, um, do you date immature men? VANESSA  Almost exclusively... HELEN  Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...  JERRY  Ma, will you go already? HELEN  Bum bum bum bum... JERRY  What are you doing?! HELEN  Wait, I just want to see something...  JERRY  You can't look in there, we're playing!  MORTY  Evening, Mr. Kramer! KRAMER  Hey Morty! (To Jerry) Salad dressing?  JERRY  Look. HELEN  \"Quo\"? Is that a word? JERRY  Maybe! HELEN  Will you challenge it? JERRY  Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! Dad, she's cheating!  KRAMER  \"Quo\"? That's not a word. HELEN  (To Jerry) You're such a stickler...  JERRY  Well put *something* down, you're taking twenty minutes on this.   So is Uncle Mac, and Artie, they're all coming over here before the   wedding? HELEN  They'll be here at two o'clock... Oh, Elaine called. She said  SHE'D BE HERE AT 2  30. Oh, and she says ``Hope your meeting went   well with Art... \"Vandelay\"?'' JERRY  She said *what*? HELEN  Just what I said, here. JERRY  She knows! Oh, I am *such* a *jackass*...  HELEN  She knows what? JERRY  She knows the whole stupid thing... Vanessa and the elevator...  HELEN  No, no, no, that won't do. He may have a \"Z\"...  MORTY  So, how did she find out? JERRY  Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told   Elaine. MORTY  So, what are you? Afraid of her? JERRY  Yes. *Yes* *I* *am*! JERRY  What else did she say on the phone?  HELEN  Whatever I wrote down. JERRY  Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?  HELEN  Who am I, Rich Little? MORTY  Well, she can't be too mad-- she's still coming to the wedding.  JERRY  Yeah, but now I'm nervous. HELEN  Oh, stop it. JERRY  \"Quone\"? HELEN  ...30...31... JERRY  \"Quone\"? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to challenge that.  HELEN  ...32... KRAMER  No, you don't have to challenge that. That's a word. That's a   *definite* word. JERRY  I am challenging... KRAMER  Quone: to quone something. JERRY  Uh-huh... HELEN  I'm not playing with you anymore...  MORTY  Quone's not a word... JERRY  No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off...  HELEN  Why did you make me put that down?  KRAMER  Nah, we need a *medical* dictionary! If a patient gets difficult,   you *quone* him... CAROL  You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work,   now that's a sitcom! JERRY  You must have quite a time down there. (Checks his watch)  CAROL  We got plenty of time... JERRY  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone...  MAC  Watch what you say to this guy-- he'll put it in his next act!  JERRY  Yeah, yeah... MAC  Jerry, did I tell you that I'm writing a book? An autobiography.  JERRY  Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it...  MAC  It's based on all my experiences! JERRY  That's perfect. (Elaine enters) Could you excuse me one second.   I'm sorry. JERRY  How do you do, Jerry Seinfeld. ELAINE  Oh, how do you do. Elaine Benes. JERRY  Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get   in the car? ELAINE  Oh no, let's do it now. JERRY  Alright, the whole elevator business, let me just explain--  ELAINE  Okay... ARTIE  Jerry, were you goin' with us? JERRY  No, I'm gonna take my car. ARTIE  That's why I brought the wagon. Why the Hell did I bring the wagon?  JERRY  Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so   uncomfortable, and you were *so* annoyed in the cab. ELAINE  Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was   quite the spectacle. CAROL  Jerry, we'll see you there. Bye, Elaine.  ELAINE  Oh, bye. Good to see you. ARTIE  Oh, we didn't meet. JERRY  Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin Artie Levine.  ARTIE  Le*vine*. JERRY  Yeah, \"Le*vine*\". And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp... Anyway, I   admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean,   obviously we have a little problem here. ELAINE  Yeah, obviously. JERRY  I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about   other people... ELAINE  Couldn't agree more. JERRY  Good. ELAINE  Good. JERRY  Good. ELAINE  Great! JERRY  Great? Where do you get \"great\"? ELAINE  It's great to... talk about... other people...  JERRY  ...Guys. ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Uh-huh... Yeah... So, anybody specific?  ELAINE  No. A general guy. JERRY  Oh *really*... Elaine Marie Benes...  ELAINE  What? No, it's not a big deal. JERRY  No, that's great! That's terrific!  ELAINE  No, we just met... JERRY  Doesn't matter. What's the young man's name? I would like to   meet him. ELAINE  I don't think so... JERRY  Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer   of some sort? ELAINE  Wall street. JERRY  Ahh, high finance: bulls... bears... people from Conneticut.  ELAINE  And he happens to be pretty good lookin'  JERRY  (pause) Alright, sir. ELAINE  And... he's *hilarious*. JERRY  Now that's not fair! So where did you meet this guy?  ELAINE  I \"staked\" out his health club. JERRY  When you're on a stakeout, do you find it's better to stand up   against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?...  JERRY  Y'know I think that even if you've had a relationship with someone,   or let's say, *especially* if you've had a relationship with someone   and you try to become friends afterwards, it's very difficult.   Isn't this? It's hard. Because, you know each other so well, you  know all of each others tricks. It's like two magicians, trying to entertain each other.  The one goes, \"Look, a rabbit.\"  The other goes, \"So? ... I believe this is your card.\"  \"Look, why don't we just saw each other in half and call it a night? Okay?\" THE END>",

        "text": "    THE ROBBERY Written by   Matt Goldman   (Comedy club) JERRY  So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this   women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that   I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me...   the finger. It seems like such an... arbitrary, ridiculous  thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person.  (shows several fingers to the audience) It's a finger, what   does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I'm   supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it's supposed to work? I   mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn't   you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the   finger. 'Cause it's not easy to give someone the toe, you've   gotta get the shoe off, the sock of and drive, get it up and   uh (pretends to drive with one foot in the air and speaks to   person driving next to him) look at that toe, buddy. (puts his   foot down) I mean, that's really insulting to get the toe,  isn't it ?  (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is packing. Elaine is sitting  at the table watching Jerry) JERRY  Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella,   something boring to read on the plane. (zips his bag with  exaggerated motions) That's it. Done! ELAINE  (claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing   performance I have ever seen. JERRY  (proudly) I am...the master packer.  ELAINE  (laughs) Yeah, right, you're the master packer.  JERRY  What you must understand, Elaine, (picks up the   umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into BATTLE  you've gotta know the strengths and weaknesses (hits   his bag rhythmically with his umbrella) of every soldier in   that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of  ordinary black socks. ELAINE  'Scuse me...master packer! JERRY  ...Yes. ELAINE  Just gimme your keys. JERRY  Alright, sir. (tosses Elaine his keys; apartment buzzer   goes of, Jerry speaks over the intercom) George? GEORGE  (outside over the intercom) Yeah ELAINE  (Jerry opens the door) OK, so, now, is there anything   else I need to know 'bout this place? JERRY  uh, yeah, the uuhh, hot water takes a little while to   come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all  your shopping, you...come back and take a shower. ELAINE  OK, this is quite a place. JERRY  There's more, the refrigerator. (Opens it) Deduct a   minimum of two days of all expiration dates. (uses the  umbrella to point to certain compartments in the refrigerator)   No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (closes the refrigerator)   that clear? ELAINE  I'll eat out. JERRY  One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity:   strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a  BIG FAVOUR  do it in the tub. GEORGE  (walks in) Ready? JERRY  Yeah, one sec. GEORGE  (closes the door) Hey, Elaine ELAINE  Hi. GEORGE  Coming to the airport with us? ELAINE  No, I'm staying here for the weekend. I'm getting a   break from my roommate. GEORGE  Oh, the actress-waitress. ELAINE  No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in   some dinner-theater production of a Chorus Line. So, now all day   \"God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it\". She's gonna get it   right in her... GEORGE  You just kick her out. ELAINE  She's on the lease!...George you have got to find an   other place for me. GEORGE  Yeah, well...a little ruff finding something good in   your price-range. (looks like he remembers something and turns   to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck. JERRY  I'm not looking. GEORGE  No no no, this one's different, this one's a beauty!  JERRY  Yeah, what's it like? GEORGE  I haven't seen it yet, but it's a \"two-bedroom\", it's   on the uh, west 83rd, 'bout a half block from the park? JERRY  How much? GEORGE  Uh, twice what you pay in here, but it's a great   building, it's two bedrooms! JERRY  Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough   trouble maintaining activity in one. (George looks at Elaine   with a \"he's-crazy-look\"; Jerry turns around) I saw that. ELAINE  You oughtta least take a look at it.  JERRY  Really? Why? ELAINE  'Cause then I could move in here. JERRY  Ooohhhh ELAINE  It's time you got out a here anyway.  GEORGE  Yeah, tell'm, but quickly, I'm double parked here.  ELAINE  Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have   no hot water, you can't have soft cheese... GEORGE  Let's not forget the radiator, the steam has been on   here for ten years; no human can turn this off. ELAINE  Jerry, come on, you're doin' OK now, you should at   least take a look at this place. You shouldn't have to live   like this. JERRY  Like this? You just said, you wanted to live here.  ELAINE  Well, for me it's a step up. It's like moving from   Island to Finland. GEORGE  Jerry, what do ya...you wanna...you wanna see the   place or not? JERRY  I can't think about it now. Come on, I'm going to   Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.  (Jerry's apartment. Jerry enters his apartment with his  bags.) JERRY  Elaine! (puts his bags down, sits down on the couch,   picks up the remote control and tries to turn on his TV) JERRY  (notices the TV is missing) ELAINE!  ELAINE  (from the bathroom) JERRY! (enters the living-room)   Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows? JERRY  Great, I had fun, where's the TV, where's the VCR.   (Elaine looks guilty) What? ELAINE  They were stolen. JERRY  Stolen? When? ELAINE  A couple a hours ago, the police are coming right   over. JERRY  Stolen? ELAINE  (Kramer enters the apartment) Someone left the door   open. (it's clear that she means Kramer; she walks to the  bathroom) JERRY  (to Kramer) You left the door open?!  KRAMER  Uh, Jer, well ya know, I was cookin' and I, I uh, I   came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, 'cause   I was gonna bring the spatula right back! JERRY  Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?  KRAMER  (bobs his head guiltily) The door.  JERRY  The door? You left the door open? KRAMER  Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.  JERRY  Yeah, and? KRAMER  Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera...(with   a broken voice) The Bold and the Beautiful JERRY  So the door was wide open? KRAMER  Wide open! JERRY  (Elaine enters the living-room) And where were you?  ELAINE  I was at Bloomingdale's...waiting for the shower to   heat up. KRAMER  Look, Jerry, I'm sorry, I'm uh, you have insurance,   right buddy? JERRY  No. KRAMER  (looks shocked) How can you not have insurance?  JERRY  Because...I spent my money on the Clapgo D. 29, it's   the most impenetrable lock on the market today...it has only  ONE DESIGN FLAW  the door...(shuts the door) must be CLOSED.  KRAMER  Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it,   I'm on the case, buddy, I'm on the case! JERRY  Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an   accident. KRAMER  (theatrical) I made a mistake. ELAINE  (idem) These things happen KRAMER  (idem) I'm human JERRY  In your way.  (Jerry's apartment. A policeman is filling out a  report. Jerry and Elaine are there.) POLICEMAN  Let's see, that's uh, one TV, a stereo, one leather   jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that 'bout it? ELAINE  Answering machine. JERRY  (disappointed) Answering machine. Oh, I hate the idea   of somebody out there returning my calls. POLICEMAN  What do ya mean? JERRY  It's a joke. POLICEMAN  I see...Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we'll look into   it and uh, we'll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find   anything. JERRY  You ever find anything? POLICEMAN  No. (hands Jerry his copy of the report)  JERRY  Well, thanks anyway. POLICEMAN  You bet. ELAINE  (Policeman leaves the apartment, while George enters)   I didn't get that joke either. JERRY  The crook has the machine. The messages aren't for him.  HE'S THE CROOK  why would he answer...(turns around and sees   George standing behind him) How did you get in here? GEORGE  (makes some weird motions) I walked in, your lobby   door is broken again. JERRY  Again. GEORGE  I don't know how you put up with this.  ELAINE  Yeah, tell'm George. JERRY  (to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?  ELAINE  Yes! You don't understand. I'm living with Ethel   Merman without the talent. JERRY  (to George) Is that uh, other apartment still   available. (George shows him the keys)  (Comedy club.) JERRY  I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now,   the first couple a times you go through it, it's very  upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will  SAY  \"Call the police. You really should call the police.\" So   \"Yeah, I'm calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts...I'm gonna   see some real action.\" Right, you think that. So, the police  GIVE YOU  your copy. Now...unless they give the crook his   copy, I don't really think we're gonna crack this case, do  you?...It's not like Batman, where there's three crooks in the   city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few   crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for  their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot.   \"Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin...I think we can   round him up, he's dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him,   he's a PENGUIN!  (The apartment on 83rd street. George, Elaine and Jerry  are entering the apartment.) ELAINE  (looks around) Oh, well, come on...this is an   apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live...Oohhh, a   fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work? (takes a closer   look at the fireplace) GEORGE  I didn't know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, this   is incredible. JERRY  How do you get all that wood in here?  ELAINE  They deliver it. JERRY  They deliver wood? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Whatta ya tip a \"wood guy\"? GEORGE  (looking intensively at the form with the apartment   description) I didn't know there was a fireplace? ELAINE  Look! Look at...look at this! There's a garden.  GEORGE  A garden! I can't believe there's a garden!  JERRY  Would I have to get a gardener? ELAINE  Yeah, you can get a gardener. JERRY  You tip him? ELAINE  You can. GEORGE  (to Elaine) You don't tip a gardener!  ELAINE  You can tip a gardener. GEORGE  You don't need a gardener. ELAINE  Jerry, you can barbecue back here (points to garden).  JERRY  They deliver the coal? ELAINE  Sure, it's...probably the same guy, who delivers the   wood. JERRY  Oh, than I gotta tip him. ELAINE  Oh damn, this place is incredible, look at all this   great light! JERRY  I don't have any plants. GEORGE  I have plants. ELAINE  Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I'm walking   in it! (walks in the closet) It's a \"walk-in\". Can you believe   it? I'm nuts about this, what do you think?! JERRY  (closes the closet with Elaine still in it)...I like   that. (opens the closet, Elaine walks out with an angry look)   What do ya think, George? GEORGE  It's your decision. JERRY  (walks around with Elaine walking next to him, copying   his every move. Suddenly Jerry stops walking; Elaine is not   able to copy this \"move\"; they look at each other laughing)   I'm takin' it, I'm takin' the place, I'm gonna take it, this   is gonna be my new place, I'm livin' here...I'm movin'. ELAINE  (laughing with joy) Your movin'? That means I'm   movin'. (hugs Jerry) Gheeeeee (runs to George) isn't that  incredible! GEORGE  Congratulations. (obviously not so thrilled by the   fact)  (Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Elaine are there.) ELAINE  What about the couch? JERRY  You like the couch? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  You're movin' in, you're a good friend, I wanna start   you off on the right foot. Give me...$150 dollars. (Elaine  looks shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall) Get it out a   here right now, take it out the door, I don't even wanna see   it, go, get it out. ELAINE  A $150 dollars? A $150 dollars for what? For this   couch? JERRY  Yeah! ELAINE  For this couch?! JERRY  (shuts the door) OK, you tell me, what is it worth?  ELAINE  OK, uuhh...I'll tell you what...I could go as high as   uh... (takes a closer look at couch) I don't know, maybe...$20   dollars? JERRY  (has a \"you-can't-be-serious-look\" on his face; the   apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry speaks over the intercom)  Yeah? GEORGE  (outside over the intercom) Yeah, it's George.  JERRY  Come on up. (opens the door; walks back to the couch)   Oh, all right, forget it, I'm gonna take it with me now...  (picks up the cushions) I'm just gonna pack up the cushions   right now... ELAINE  OK ok ok ok, you win: $40 dollars.  JERRY  You wanna get the other end, 'cause I wanna get it in   the hall. (acts like he's going to lift up the couch) ELAINE  $50 dollars, OK? $50 dollars, is that all right?  JERRY  $50 dollars? ELAINE  Uh-huh. JERRY  Thank you very much. ELAINE  Thank you very much. GEORGE  (walks in and closes the door) Hey, what's goin' on?  ELAINE  I just bought Jerry's couch for $50 dollars.  JERRY  (to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes   the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry) All   right, ghee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.  GEORGE  Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry (said very quickly),   listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at ALL, AT ALL  do not feel like you have to take it.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  If you're having second thoughts, if you didn't want   it,  don't worry about it because uh, ya know, I, I...I could take   it, ya know. (said with a \"for-instance-look\" on his face) JERRY  You could take it? You want it? GEORGE  No, I don't want it. I want it, if you don't want it.  JERRY  So you do want it. GEORGE  No I, I want it if you don't want it!  JERRY  You just said, you wanted it! GEORGE  No, I'm saying, if a situation arose in which you   didn't want it, I might take it. JERRY  (picks up the lease and hands it to George) So take it.  GEORGE  (refuses to take the lease from Jerry; Elaine looks   worried) How can I take it?! JERRY  How can I take it? GEORGE  It's your apartment! JERRY  How can I want it now, if you want it?  ELAINE  Excuse me, uuhh, I don't mean to cause any trouble   here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place? GEORGE  Yes, but I am not taking it. JERRY  I...am not taking it. (drops the lease demonstratively)  ELAINE  Well, one of you better damn well take it!  JERRY  Well, whatta you wanna do here? GEORGE  I, I don't know. (makes a gesture, that he doesn't   know) JERRY  Do you wanna flip a coin? GEORGE  ...Who flips?...You'll flip, I'll call.  JERRY  OK, fine...(takes a coin from his pocket) This is the   official flip! No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and  that's it, agreed? GEORGE  I'm good. ELAINE  I don't know, who to rune for, George's place has   carpeting. JERRY  All right, now you call it in the air.  GEORGE  No catchin'. JERRY  No no. GEORGE  Flip it. (Jerry flips the coin) Heads! (the coin hits   the table. It falls on the floor; they all look intently at   the coin) JERRY  Tails! GEORGE  No, it hit the table, it hit the table.  JERRY  So what? GEORGE  INTERFERENCE! YOU CAN'T COUNT THAT. COME ON, ARE YOU   CRAZY?!! THE COIN CAN NOT TOUCH ANYTHING, it affects it. JERRY  You didn't call no interference! GEORGE  YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL THAT. THAT'S A RULE!!  JERRY  I don't believe this. GEORGE  Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it,   just take it! JERRY  I don't wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do ya   think? ELAINE  I'd better not... JERRY  ...Well, I'll tell ya what: I'll choose you for it.   Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that's it, you   gotta win three. GEORGE  OK (they walk around each other)...OK. I'll choose   you...whatta ya want? JERRY  Odds GEORGE  I want evens. JERRY  Good. GEORGE  You got odds.  JERRY You got evens. GEORGE  Right, ready. JERRY  For the apartment. (they take their \"choose positions\")  BOTH  Once, twice, three, shoot! JERRY  Mine! BOTH  Once, twice, three, shoot! JERRY  Mine! (George walks to the table to take a break)  BOTH  (they take their positions again) Once, twice, three,   shoot! GEORGE  Mine! BOTH  Once, twice, three, shoot! GEORGE  (Jerry wins, Elaine starts measuring up Jerry's couch)   Congratulations...congratulations. JERRY  Thanks. (George walks to the bathroom)  GEORGE  (screaming in bathroom) WHAT DID I PUT UP TO? WHAT DID   I PUT UP TO? KRAMER  (enters the apartment \"Kramer-style\") Jerry, I think   I'm on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the   Englishman, who lives down the hall? JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  The last couple a days he's been acting very strange;   I think he's avoiding me. JERRY  Hard to imagine. (ironically) KRAMER  Yeah! And get this: I just got of the elevator with   him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I   said to him, like I, I was like this (shows how he was acting   stuff.\" JERRY  Right. KRAMER  Ya know, very casually, so that he was gonna take me   in to his confidence. ELAINE  So what did he say? KRAMER  \"What stuff?\". JERRY  Ooh, case closed! (ironically) KRAMER  No, you don't understand, you see, he swallowed...see,   the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something!  Now, I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna borrow some tee...if I   don't get back in five minutes, maybe you'd better call the   police. JERRY  OK, starting (looks at his watch)...NOW!  KRAMER  Yeah! (said in his own typical way and he runs off)   (Comedy club) JERRY  One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid,   you have a certain way of working out disagreements...and  those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main way   that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them  SAY  \"I got the front seat\" (other kid's voice) \"I wanted the   front seat!\" (first kid again) \"I called it\". And the other   called it, what can I do?\". If there was a \"kid-court of law\"  IT HOLDS UP  (lawyer's voice) \"Your Honour, my client did ask   it?\" (lawyer's voice again) \"Well no, he didn't call...\" BANG!   (imitating a hammer being hit by the judge); (judges voice  again) \"He has to call it, case closed...objection overruled\".   (Coffee house, called Monk's; Jerry is sitting at a  table, George is returning from the bathroom) GEORGE  (walks towards the table) I love the mirror in that   in that mirror. (sits down) I don't know if it's the tile or   the lighting...I feel like Robert Wagner. JERRY  (bobs his head) It's a good mirror...(both look at   their menus) So, what are ya gettin'? GEORGE  I don't know, I can't eat, ya, ya can't have anything  FRENCH FRIES  out, BLT: out!...I go to visit my grandparents:   three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sittin' here with a carrot!   you eat that stuff?!\"...(they look at their menus again) I'm   so sick about losin' that choose, you don't know. JERRY  Oh, right, forget it, forget it, I'm not taking the   place! GEORGE  What?! JERRY  How can I live there? GEORGE  Why not?! JERRY  Look at you, you're still thinking about it, I'll never   feel comfortable. GEORGE  Oh, get out a here. JERRY  How can I ever have you over? You'll sit there moping.  GEORGE  Mope? JERRY  You're already moping!...Would you take the place?  GEORGE  No, impossible! It's your apartment.  JERRY  You found the place. GEORGE  You won the choose. JERRY  All right, forget it, it's over, I'm not moving.  GEORGE  Well, me neither. JERRY  Definitely? GEORGE  Definitely. JERRY  Oh, than just get rid of it. You won't have any   problem. GEORGE  No, it's not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment   this afternoon. (a waitress approaches) WAITRESS  What apartment? GEORGE  Oh, it's a great place, it's uh \"two-bedroom\" uh, west   83rd 'bout half block from the park. WAITRESS  What's the rent?  (The apartment on 83rd street. The waitress bought it;  Jerry, Elaine and George are invited, they're sitting on a  couch, all three moping) GEORGE  I don't know, what we're doin' here, this is   ridiculous. JERRY  She wanted to thank us for the apartment. (very   irritated) ELAINE  I can't believe I lost the deposit on that u-hall. (I   can't quite understand what she'd saying here)And I threw out   my couch. (She slaps Jerry on the leg) JERRY  If only the coin hadn't hit the table.  GEORGE  The table is interference, you know it!  JERRY  It is not! GEORGE  It is too! ELAINE  My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carrousel.   (irritated) WAITRESS  Hi. GEORGE  Hi, Carol. CAROL  I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is   Larry (points to her husband; Jerry, Elaine and George get  up). This is George, Elaine and Jerry (points to them) (to  Larry) These are the guys who got us the apartment. LARRY  Oh, you don't know how grateful I am, if there's   anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, we're just so   thrilled with this place. CAROL  It's a dream. LARRY  I'm running in the park now, I've lost weight, we're   barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable. GEORGE  We're really glad for ya. (very sadly)  ELAINE  Couldn't be happier. (idem) JERRY  It's wonderful. (idem; they sit down again)  CAROL  Diane, Diane, come here. (she beckons a women; she   comes to the couch) This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.   (Jerry, Elaine and George get up; Diane appears to be very  attractive) (to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this  place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine)   Diane gave me the greatest backrub today, she's a masseuse!  DIANE  How, how could you guys have turned this place down,   it's such a great location and it's...so close to the park.  GEORGE  We're aware of the proximity to the park, yes.  DIANE  Well, it was nice to meet you. (she walks away)  GEORGE  Nice meeting you. (shakes Carol's hand; they sit down   again; Carol walks away) JERRY  How late are the stores open? I'm thinking of maybe uh,   buying a new TV and smash it over my head. (two men are  standing behind the couch talking) RIGHT MAN  I get a call from Gilmore this morning and get  THIS  they're restructuring the organization in Atlanta and I   gotta be there on the first of the month. LEFT MAN  Really? What are you gonna 'bout the apartment?  RIGHT GUY  Well, what can I do? Give it up. THE END>",

        "text": "   MALE UNBONDING Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Nightclub) JERRY  Most men like working on things, tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy's out in his driveway working on   something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies.   Men, it's true, men hear a drill, it's like a dog whistle. Just.. you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, \"Honey, I think Jim's working on something over   there.\" So they run over to the guy. Now they don't actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That's what men   want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, \"What are you using, the Philips head?\" You know,   we feel involved. That's why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that's just to keep the men out. They cut those   little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don't cut those holes - we are climbing those fences. Right over there. \"What are you using the   steel girders down there? Yeah, that'll hold.\"  (Jerry's apartment building)  (Jerry and George are waiting for the elevator) GEORGE  I had to say something. I had to say something. Everything was going so well; I had to say something.  JERRY  I don't think you did anything wrong.  GEORGE  I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don't tell you.  JERRY  We can only thank God for that.  (Elevator opens, they get on) GEORGE  I'm outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) It's only a matter of time now.  JERRY  You're imagining this. Really. GEORGE  Oh no. No, no, no, no.  (elevator doors close) GEORGE  I'll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.  JERRY  What floss? When? GEORGE  We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my   pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there's this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.  JERRY  Ah, mint. GEORGE  Of course. So, I'm looking at it, I look up, I see she's looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..   (eleveator doors open, they get off) JERRY  So let me get this straight: she saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.  GEORGE  If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, I'd be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.  JERRY  And you're sure the floss was the catalyst?  GEORGE  Yes, I am. JERRY  (looks at a carrying pouch George is wearing) You don't think it might've had anything to do with that?  GEORGE  What? You don't like this? JERRY  It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.   (they go into Jerry's apartment to find Kramer talking on the phone)  KRAMER  Oh, they've got a cure for cancer. See, it's all big business.. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (resumes talking on the phone) Yeah, yeah yeah,   yeah, take my number - 555-8643. Okay, here he is. (hands phone to Jerry.)  JERRY  (to Kramer) Who is it? KRAMER  Take it. JERRY  Who is it? KRAMER  It's for you. JERRY  (into phone) Hello? Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) .. No. I was out of town. I just got back.. Kramer doesn't know anything.. He's just   my next-door neighbor. Uh.. nothing much.. Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I'm meeting somebody.. Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday's okay.. Alright. Uh, I'm a little busy   right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning? .. Okay.. yeah.. right.. thanks.. bye. (hangs up, then addresses Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I   hate just being handed a phone. KRAMER  Well, it's your phone. He wanted to talk to you  JERRY  Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.  KRAMER  Well, why not? JERRY  He bothers me. I don't even answer the phone anymore because of him. He's turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.  GEORGE  What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We're not   going? JERRY  We're going. That's next Wednesday.  GEORGE  Oh. Who is this guy? JERRY  His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of   my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would've been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table.. he's so self-involved.   (phone rings, Kramer pulls his phone out of his pocket) KRAMER  That's for me. (into phone) Kramerica Industries.. Oh, hi, Mark.. No, no, no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own   pie. JERRY  Can you conduct your business elsewhere?  KRAMER  (ignoring Jerry) No, no, no. I'm talking about a whole chain of 'em. Yeah. (Kramer leaves Jerry's apartment while still on the phone.)  GEORGE  I don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.  JERRY  I don't bother with him. He's been calling me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit   there and I make up things just to see if he's paying attention.  GEORGE  I don't understand why you spend time with this guy.  JERRY  What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him \"I Don't think we're right for each other..\" He's a guy. At least with a woman, there's a precendent. You know,   the relationship goes sour, you end it. GEORGE  No, no, no,no you have to approach this as if he was a woman.  JERRY  Just break up with him? GEORGE  Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.   (scene ends)  (Nightclub) JERRY  As a guy I don't know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say, \"Bill, I feel I need to see other men.\" Do   you know what I mean? There's nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that's the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See,   the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they're two guys. That's almost   all we need to have in common. 'Cause sports - sports and women - is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever   say is \"So, what's in the refrigerator?\"  (Coffee Shop)  (Jerry and Joel are sitting at a table) JOEL  ..so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him.. and I think, uh, Geraldo.  JERRY  You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really - interesting.. he would-  JOEL  (interrupting) Hey, hey, hey, hey we're starving here! We've been waiting here for ten minutes already!  JERRY  (testing Joel) So, I'm thinking about going to Iran this summer.  JOEL  I have to eat! I mean, I'm hypoglycemic.  JERRY  Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. You know, it's their annual terrorist luncheon. I'm gonna do it is Farsi.  JOEL  Do you think I need a haircut?  (waitress comes to their table) WAITRESS  Are you ready? JERRY  Yeah, I'll have the egg salad on whole wheat.  JOEL  Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don't want that processed turkey. I hate it.  WAITRESS  I think it's real turkey. JOEL  Is there a real bird in the back? WAITRESS  No, there's not bird but- JOEL  Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don't you do me a favor. Why don't you go in the back and find out, okay?   (waitress leaves) JOEL  (cont.) Unbelievable.. JERRY  How can you talk to someone like that?  JOEL  What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?  JERRY  Listen, Joel. There's something I have to tell you.  JOEL  Wait, you'll never guess who I ran into.  JERRY AND JOEL  Howard metro. JOEL  He asked me if I still saw you. I said, \"Sure, I see him all the time. We're great friends.\" Anyway, Howard says hello.  JERRY  ..listen, Joel.. I don't think we should see each other anymore.  JOEL  what? JERRY  This friendship.. it's not working.  JOEL  Not working? What are you talking about?  JERRY  We're just not suited to be friends.  JOEL  How can you say that? JERRY  Look, you're a nice guy, it's just that - we don't have anything in common.  JOEL  (starting to cry) Wait. Wat did I do? Tell me.. I want to know.  JERRY  You didn't do anything. It's not you, it's me. It's.. this is very difficult.  JOEL  Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you're a very busy guy.  JERRY  No, it's not that. JOEL  (crying) You're one of the few people I can talk to.  JERRY  Oh, come on. That's not true. JOEL  I always tell everybody about you; tell everybody to go see your show. I mean, I'm your biggest fan!  JERRY  I know, I know. JOEL  I mean, you're my best friend. JERRY  Best friend? I've never been to your apartment.  JOEL  I cannot believe that this is happening. I can't believe it.  JERRY  Okay, okay. Forget it. It's okay. Id didn't mean it.  JOEL  Didn't mean what? JERRY  What I said. I've been under a lot of stress.  JOEL  Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.  JERRY  Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I'm sorry. I din't mean it. I took it out on you. We're still friends. We're still friends. Still friends.   Okay? Look, I'll tell you what. I've got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.  JOEL  Tonight? JERRY  No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would've said tonight.  JOEL  Do you really want me to go? JERRY  (faking) Yes. JOEL  Okay. yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that'd be great.. so, next Wednesday.  JERRY  Next Wednesday. JOEL  Where is that waitress?! Hey! ..  (scene ends)  (Bank)  (Jerry is at the counter, filling out a slip; George is carrying a jug full of pennies.)  GEORGE  ..she calls me up at my office, she says, \"We have to talk.\"  JERRY  Uh, the four worst words in the English language.  GEORGE  That, or \"Who's bra is this?\" JERRY  That is worse. GEORGE  So we order lunch, and we're talking. Finally, she blurts out how it's \"not working\".  JERRY  Really. GEORGE  So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this, I'm thinking: great, the relationship's over. But the egg salad's on the way. So now I have a decision - do I walk or   do I eat? JERRY  Hm? You ate. GEORGE  We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.  JERRY  Someone says, \"Get out of my life!\" and that doesn't affect your appetite?  GEORGE  Have you ever had their egg salad?  JERRY  It is unbelievable. GEORGE  It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off   with a sandwich. JERRY  (looking at George's penny jug) How much could you possibly have in there? GEORGE: It's my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I   know guy who took his vacation on change. JERRY  Yeah? Where'd he go? To and arcade?  GEORGE  (sarcastic) That's funny. You're a funny guy.  JERRY  C'mon, move up.  (George moves up in the bank line) CUSTOMER  Oh great, Ewing's hurt. GEORGE  Ewing's hurt? How long is he going to be out?  CUSTOMER  A couple of days at the most but..  GEORGE  Geez. JERRY  Oh, God. GEORGE  I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.  JERRY  Listen, George, little problem with the game.  GEORGE  What about it? JERRY  The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..  GEORGE  What? JERRY  I geve your ticket to Horneck. GEORGE  You what?! JERRY  Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.  GEORGE  No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?  JERRY  (talking about the line) C'mon, c'mon, go ahead, move up.  GEORGE  Why did you give him my ticket for?  JERRY  You didn't see him. It was horrible.  GOERGE  Oh, c'mon, Jerry. I can't believe this.  JERRY  I had to do it.  (George is up to the teller, Jerry goes to another one.) GEORGE  Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?  TELLER  I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that. JERRY  Do you want to go with him? You go. I don't mind.  GEORGE  I'm not going with him. I don't even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.  TELLER  Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself.  GEORGE  You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!   (Scene ends.)  (Nightclub) JERRY  I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression \"Laughing all the way to the bank.\" I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate   it when there's nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it's empty and you still have to go through the little maze. \"Can you get a little piece   of cheese for me? I'm almost at the front. I'd like a reward for this please.\"   (Jerry's apartment)  (George is stuffing pennies into rolls.) GEORGE  ..Thirty-two, thirty-three- JERRY  George. GEORGE  (raises his hand) Not now.. (counts to himself).  JERRY  Could you stop the counting? GEORGE  Nnnnnnnninngaaa! (Dumping out roll) What?!  JERRY  Can I make it up to you? I'll give you fifty bucks for the jug.  GEORGE  Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money. JERRY  Well, then I'm not going to the game either. Okay? I'll give him both tickets.  GEORGE  (pantomimes sticking an imaginary knife in his heart, and twists it) Oh geeeee.. Go, go!  JERRY  I.. no, I don't want to go. GEORGE  He was really crying? JERRY  I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I'll just make up some excuse why I can't go to the game either.  GEORGE  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you're going to lie to the guy, why don't you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we could go?  JERRY  George, the man wept.  (Kramer enters.) KRAMER  Oh, hey guys. Man, I'm telling you. This pizza idea, is really going to happen.  GEORGE  This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?  KRAMER  Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air; and then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese,   and they - you slide it into the oven. GOERGE  You know, you have to know how to do that. You can't have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven.  KRAMER  It's all supervised. GEORGE  Oh, well. KRAMER  All of it. You want to invest? GEORGE  My money's all tied up in change right now.  KRAMER  No, I'm tellin' ya, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.  JERRY  I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never.. I can't imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own   pizza pie.. but that's me. KRAMER  That's you. JERRY  I'm just saying.. KRAMER  Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.  JERRY  Okay. KRAMER  You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted .. okay. (he exits quickly, then sticks his head back through the door) One day, you'll beg me to   make your own pie. (he leaves)  (Jerry dials up Joel) JERRY  Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you - Oh, Hi. Joel.. oh, you just came in.. listen, I can't amke it to the game tonight. I, uh, have to tutor my   nephew - Yeah, he's got an exam tomarrow.. geometry.. you know, trapezoids, rhombus.. Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They're at the Will-Call window..   And I'm really sorry.. Have a good time. We'll talk next week. Okay.. yeah, I don't.. fine.. fine.. bye. (he hangs up).  GEORGE  Trapezoid? JERRY  I know. I'm really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse Rolodex.   (Scene ends.)  (Jerry's apartment, night time) ELAINE  Come on, let's go do something. I don't want to just sit around here.  JERRY  Okay. ELAINE  Want to go get something to eat? JERRY  Where do you want to go? ELAINE  I don't care, I'm not hungry. JERRY  We could go to one of those cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.  ELAINE  What are we gonna do there? Talk? JERRY  We can talk. ELAINE  I'll go if I don't have to talk. JERRY  We'll just sit there. ELAINE  Okay. I'm gonna check my machine first.   (Elaine sees a pad by the phone, and starts reading it.) ELAINE  (cont.) \"Picking someone up at the airport.\" \"Jury Duty.\" \"Waiting for cable guy.\"  JERRY  Okay, just ahnd that over, please.  ELAINE  Oh, what is this? JERRY  It's a list of excuses, it's for that guy, Horneck, who's at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and i don't   have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?  ELAINE  I got some for you. JERRY  I don't need anymore. ELAINE  No, no, no, no, no, these are good. Listen, listen: \"You ran out of underwear, you can't leave the house.\"  JERRY  (sarcastic) Very funny. ELAINE  How about: \"You've been diagnosed as a multiple personality, you're not even you, you're Dan.\"  JERRY  I'm Dan. Can I have my list back, please?  ELAINE  (gives Jerry the list) Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you're doing this. This is absolutely infantile.  JERRY  What can I do? ELAINE  Deal with it. Be a man! JERRY  Oh no. That's impossible. I'd rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying, tears accompanied by mucus.  ELAINE  You made a man cry? I've never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn't cry.. I got the cab.  JERRY  A couple of touch monkeys.  (Elaine laughs, Kramer enters.) KRAMER  Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!  JERRY  Game? KRAMER  Knock game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We were getting hit by sweat!  JERRY  Wait. How does Horneck know you? KRAMER  Last week. When I, you know, game you the phone. He's really into my pizza place idea!  JERRY  This is too much. ELAINE  Wait, what pizza place idea? JERRY  Oh, no. KRAMER  You make your own pie! ELAINE  Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.  JOEL  (from the hallway.)Kramer.. KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  Perfect.  (Horneck enters.) JOEL  Hey.. KRAMER  Okay, who wants meatloaf? JERRY AND ELAINE  No thanks. KRAMER  (to Joel) It's gonna be hot in a minute. (exits)  JOEL  So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?  JERRY  Oh, we finished early. JOEL  Uhm, I'll bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your - nephew?  JERRY  Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.  ELAINE  Hi. JOEL  Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?  JERRY  We're still friends. JOEL  So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, I'm going to take you. You about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why don't you come along?  ELAINE  Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good becasue we've got choir practice.  JERRY  Right. I forgot about choir. ELAINE  We're doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.  JERRY  Right. You know, the wall being down and everything.  JOEL  (to Jerry) What about Thursday night? I mean they're playing the Sonics.   (Jerry shakes his head.) ELAINE  Huh... Thursday is not good because we've got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.  JOEL  You know, I should really try something like that.  JERRY  You really should. JOEL  Well, let's just take a look here. (looks at his schedule) Forty-one home games. Saturday night we've got the mavericks. If you don't like the Mavericks, next   Tuesday - Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let's see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls.   You can't miss Air Jordan..  (Scene ends.)  (Nightclub) JERRY  You know, I really.. I've come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in you life that they're just always your friends and you have to accept it. You   see them, you don't really want to see them. You don't call them. They call you. You don't call back. They call again. The only way to get through talking with people   that you don't really have anything in common with is to pretend you're hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there's a little desk around   you. The only problem with this is there's no way you can say, \"Hey, it's been great having you on the show. Were out of time.\"      THE END>",

        "text": "   THE STOCK TIP Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Nightclub) JERRY  Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because   money's a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat money has no value. And you don't care about money when you're hungry, you sit down at a   restaurant. You're like the ruler of an empire. \"More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives.\" Then after the meal, you know,   you've got the pants open, you've got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes - then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset,   you know. They're mystified by the check. \"What is this? How could this be?\" They start passing it around the table, \"Does this look right to you? We're not hungry   now. Why are we buying all this food?!\" I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.  GEORGE  I never heard him say anything really funny.  JERRY  But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed.. I'm sure he's got super humor.  GEORGE  You would think that, but either you're born with a sense of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all   the way to the yellow sun of the Earth. JERRY  Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?  GEORGE  I don't know but he ain't funny.  (Elaine joins them, they check their watches.) ELAINE  I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.  JERRY  No problem. ELAINE  I dropped a grape. GEORGE  Pardon? ELAINE  I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn't find it. I was... I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I   have no idea where it went. JERRY  Were you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find it.  ELAINE  No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm going out with -  JERRY  Robert. ELAINE  Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even go into his apartment, you   know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor's studio so we can't go there. It's really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won't even go away fro the   weekend because of these cats. GEORGE  Guys with cats.. I don't know. JERRY  I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing -  ELAINE  Vanessa. JERRY  Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.  GEORGE  Oh no. No, no,no,no,no. I'd have to advise against that. What do you know this woman, a month? Let's see, you're going to be with her seventy-two   hours. That's a dating decathlon. ELAINE  (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don't you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with   the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She'll love it. GEORGE  (To Elaine) That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?   (Elaine gets the paper, he starts flipping through it.) JERRY  You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. (Elaine laughs) There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas   panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.  GEORGE  (To himself) Up again?! This is incredible. I'm.. I'm getting it.  ELAINE  You're getting what? GEORGE  A stock. JERRY  What stock? GEORGE  Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?  JERRY  Maybe. GOERGE  He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he's got some new thing - you know, there's supposed to be a big merger.   He wasn't even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.  JERRY  How high's it suppose to go? GEORGE  I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?  JERRY  Boy.. I don't know. ELAINE  I'd do it but I don't have any money.  JERRY  What kind of company is it? GEORGE  It's Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for televising opera.  ELAINE  Televising opera? GEORGE  Some sort of electronic thingy. JERRY  Well, how much are you going to invest?  GEORGE  (Unsure) Five thousand.. ten. Ten thousand.. Five thousand.  JERRY  Boy.. GEORGE  C'mon. Wilkinson's got millions invested in this stock. It's gone up three points since I've been watching it.  JERRY  What if I lose it? GEORGE  C'mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together. Come on, come on. We're in it together.  JERRY  (gives in) All right -- twenty-five hundred.  GEORGE  That's it.  (Waitress arrives) WAITRESS  Yeah, can I take your order? GEORGE  (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.  JERRY  My bet? All right.. I'll open with a tuna sandwich.  ELAINE  Tuna? JERRY  Oh, the dolphin thing? ELAINE  They're dying in the nets. JERRY  Ooohhh.. You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.  ELAINE  Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?  JERRY  Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I'm always waving everybody in. \"Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.\" ..Alright.. alright. I'll have   a chicken salad. ELAINE  And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.  WAITRESS  Okay. (To George) What about you? GEORGE  I'll have the tuna.  (Scene ends.)  (A Korean Market) JERRY  I have to say. Those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.  VANESSA  Why didn't you do something? JERRY  What do you want me to do? I have the guy the half-turn. Then I have him the full-turn with the eye roll! I mean, beyond that, I'm risking a punch in the   mouth.. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?  STOCK BOY  No puffs. Just flakes. JERRY  Have you thought any more about that trip?  VANESSA  Yeah, I've been thinking about it.  JERRY  You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.  VANESSA  I don't know. I just worry about trips like this.. It's a lot of pressure.  JERRY  It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish   (snaps) three days. VANESSA  Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?  JERRY  Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.  VANESSA  (Starting to like the idea) Really? Could we go fishing up there?  JERRY  Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?  VANESSA  They have marlin in Vermont? JERRY  Oh, big fighting marlin.  (Jerry picks up a paper) VANESSA  Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.  JERRY  I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different.. sources.   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment. Jerry's looking at a road map; Kramer is looking at the paper)  JERRY  Is that my paper? KRAMER  Bad news, my friend. JERRY  What? What news? KRAMER  Sendrax. JERRY  Oh, c'mon! It's down again?! KRAMER  Two and a half points. JERRY  Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. (Looks at the paper) That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half my money!  KRAMER  Hey, I told ya. JERRY  (Sarcastic) Yeah, you told me. KRAMER  It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.  JERRY  (Holding the phone, calling George) There's one thing I don't understand. Why does it please you? (Into phone) George Costanza, please.  KRAMER  Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!  JERRY  (Into phone) George, what's going on?!  KRAMER  Sell it, just say I'm selling! JERRY  (Into phone) Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half my money's gone.. Well, call me right back. (Hangs up) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He   hasn't been home or in his office in the past three days! KRAMER  You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.  JERRY  Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?  KRAMER  Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting coming up.  JERRY  Okay. KRAMER  You just (makes noise) tear it off, and you got a new one right here. Then you're gone.  JERRY  You're gone alright. KRAMER  (Looking at map) Hey, where.. where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map.. what..  JERRY  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days.  KRAMER  Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.  JERRY  What friends? KRAMER  Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert.   (Phone rings) KRAMER  Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give him a look) 'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, they're anarchists.   They're.. they're.. they're.. huge.  (Jerry answers phone) JERRY  George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. (Hangs up) Wilkinson, the guy   who's supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he's in the hospital.   (Kramer has a pleased reaction on his face)  (Scene ends)  (Dry-Cleaning store; Jerry and George are in line) JERRY  So you don't know what's wrong with him?  GEORGE  All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.  JERRY  Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?  GEORGE  Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all.  JERRY  Well, this is it. I'm selling. GEORGE  Just give it a little more time. JERRY  I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous wreck. I\"m not cut out for investing.  GEORGE  Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there.  JERRY  Where? GEORGE  To the hospital. JERRY  The hospital? GEORGE  I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?  JERRY  Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.  GEORGE  So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I'll work my way around to it.  JERRY  What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (knocking on glass) \"How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (makes hissing sound) By the   way, what's happening with Sendrax?\" GEORGE  Maybe he's resting. JERRY  Who goes to the hospital to rest? GEORGE  What are you, a doctor? JERRY  Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?  GEORGE  Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you hear from me.  JERRY  Alright.  (Jerry moves up in line, a woman takes his place. George didn't notice)  GEORGE  (To woman, thinking she's Jerry) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.   (Woman gives him a look) DRY CLEANER  May I help you? JERRY  Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it.  DRY CLEANER  When did you bring it in? JERRY  What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!  DRY CLEANER  You got a receipt? JERRY  I can't find the receipt. DRY CLEANER  You should get the receipt. JERRY  Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!  DRY CLEANER  Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?  JERRY  What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! In fact, forget the money. I don't even   want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That's what I want. I want an admission of guilt.  DRY CLEANER  Maybe you asked for it to be washed?  JERRY  No.. dry-cleaned. DRY CLEANER  Let me explain to you something. Okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing..  JERRY  (Interrupting) You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!  DRY CLEANER  I shrunk it.  (Scene ends.)  (Night club) JERRY  I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, \"Well, it's ruined.\" And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, \"It's not   our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation.\" You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this   is actually possible. Right? They're cleaning our clothes - but they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids   that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (brushes   shirt) - that's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what they're doing back there. They don't have eighty guys going (with imaginary brush) \"Come on, hurry up! There's a   lot of shirts today.\"  (Jerry's apartment)  (Elaine sneezes) JERRY  Bless you. ELAINE  Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers   four times a day and he can't count to ten. So don't give me hygiene.  JERRY  So what are you gonna do? ELAINE  I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to   rub out a couple of cats? JERRY  Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?  ELAINE  What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?  JERRY  I'm no cat killer. ELAINE  How about we go over there right now and we shave them?  JERRY  I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.  ELAINE  He actually wen to the hospital? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Oh man, he's nuts. JERRY  Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper) I know, I know. It's down again.  KRAMER  How much are you down altogether? JERRY  I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.  KRAMER  Wow. JERRY  You don't have to say \"Wow.\" I know it's \"Wow.\" And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?   (Intercom buzzes) JERRY  It's George. (Presses button to let George in.)   (Elaine goes into the bathroom; kramer picks up some binoculars and looks ou the window)  KRAMER  Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.  JERRY  I really don't need to look. KRAMER  What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me.  JERRY  Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.  KRAMER  I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. (leaves)   (Enter George; he flops onto the couch) JERRY  What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods) Did he tell you what's gonna happen? (George shakes his head \"no\".) How long were you there?  GEORGE  Fifteen seconds. JERRY  You told him you knew Simons? GEORGE  Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell you one thing.. I don't know   what he's got. But for a sick guy, he's very strong.  (Elaine exits bathroom) JERRY  Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want to think about this. I'm selling.  ELAINE  Didn't work, huh? GEORGE  (Laughs) Not quite. ELAINE  Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?  GEORGE  I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship.   (Scene ends.)  (Country Inn) JERRY  So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount now.  VANESSA  I know. You mentioned it. JERRY  Oh yeah, right. (To himself) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still got another day! I've got   nothing left to say. Wait.. wait.. got one. (To Vanessa) That's a nice watch. Do you wind it?  VANESSA  No, it's got a little battery. JERRY  Well, that's good. (To himself) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don't care. (To Vanessa)   That' the manager? Do you wnat me to see if we can get another room?  VANESSA  No, it's okay. JERRY  So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the hot and cold - charming?  VANESSA  Not especially. JERRY  Well, what do you wnat to do this afternoon?  VANESSA  What can we do? It's raining. JERRY  We cold play \"Sorry!\" We cold play \"Steal the Old Man's Bundle.\" (To himself) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (To Vanessa) What   kind of perfume is that you're wearing? VANESSA  Oh, you've never heard of it. JERRY  No, what? What kind is it? VANESSA  I can't tell you. JERRY  (To himself) Yeah, that's normal. (Out loud, to a man nearby) Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?  VANESSA  That stock? I thought you got out of that?  JERRY  I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want to check it out. (finds stock) Six points. It's up six points!  VANESSA  I told you not to sell. JERRY  You did not tell me not to sell. VANESSA  I said, the market fluctuates. Remember?  JERRY  Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!  VANESSA  That's probably why.. (stops herself)  JERRY  What? VANESSA  Forget it. JERRY  No, what? 'That's probably why..' VANESSA  That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost money on the stock.  JERRY  (To himself) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that purfume..   (Scene ends.)  (Coffee shop) GEORGE  Have something else. C'mon, have a little dessert?  JERRY  I'm good, thanks. GEORGE  Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of.  ELAINE  I'm kinda full. GEORGE  So don't finish it. JERRY  (acidly) She's full. (George puts up his hands in an \"excuse me\" gesture.) So, Big daddy. I'm just curious. How much did you clear on your little trasaction   there? All told? GEORGE  I don't like to discuss figures. JERRY  How much? GEORGE  I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.  JERRY  So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now?  GEORGE  No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly from a nose job.   (Elaine sneezes) JERRY  Is taht still from the cats? ELAINE  No, I just have a cold. JERRY  So, what ever happened with that? ELAINE  I gave him an ultimatum. (Shrugs) GEORGE  He chose the cats? ELAINE  They're very clean animals. JERRY  I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.  ELAINE  Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.  GEORGE  I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time.   You'd get all the money back - you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont.  ELAINE  Superman can go back in time? JERRY  We went over that. GEORGE  Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one.. Petramco Corp. Out of, hu, Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort of robot butcher.  JERRY  A robot butcher? GOERGE  Shhhhh. If you want to get in - there's very little time. (Calling to waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress tears of check, George stops her) No, no, no. That'   ought to coever it. (He hands her some money, she turns to leave, George stops her) Just a second.. Just a.. let me.. (looks at the check, then take some money out   of her hand.) (Urging Jerry and Elaine to eat) Come on, come on, come on..   (Scene ends.)  (Night club) JERRY  I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna let the money relax. You   know what I mean? 'Cause you send your money out there - working for you - a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, \"What happened? I had my money. It   was here, it was working for me.\" \"Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.\"   THE END>",

        "text": "           THE EX-GIRLFRIEND Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Nightclub) JERRY  I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never quite sure, \"Is this the best lane for   me? For my life?\" They're always a little bit ahead of you, \"Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?\" \"Yeah, come on over here, pal.   We're zoomin' over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it..\" The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not   even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen?   Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we'll be going \"Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad.   I'm gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.\"   (Jerry's car) GEORGE  She can't kill me right?! JERRY  No, of course not. GEORGE  People break up all the time. JERRY  Everyday. GEORGE  It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.  JERRY  You tried. GEORGE  I kept looking at her face. I'd go: \"C'mon, love her. Love her!\"  JERRY  Did you tell her you loved her? GEORGE  Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go \"Oh, really?\" or \"Boy, that's, that's   something.\" But, eventually you have to come back with \"Well, I love you.\" You know, you can only hold out for so long!\"  JERRY  You're a human being. GEORGE  And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do that to someone.  JERRY  You're too nice a guy. GEORGE  I am. I'm a nice guy.. (realizing) And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair - I get up to go to the   bathroom, I come back, she's on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn't do that. I would've insulted her.  JERRY  You're flesh and blood. GEORGE  I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But   they were everywhere! They kept popping up, all over the place. \"This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy.. This is my cousin.. this is my brother.. thisis my father.\"   It's like I'm in quicksand. JERRY  I told you when I met her.. GEORGE  My back is killing me. JERRY  You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best.  GEORGE  Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best.  JERRY  I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.  GEORGE  Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach for these things.  JERRY  You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!   (Car door opens, it's Elaine) ELAINE  Hi. JERRY  Hi.  (George pulls his seat forward to allow Elaine into the back seats)  ELAINE  Hey, what are you doing? GEORGE  I'm letting you in. ELAINE  Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left out of the conversation.  GEORGE  No, you won't. ELAINE  Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of the seat.  GEORGE  Okay..  (George gets out, and gestures for Elaine to sit in the seat)  ELAINE  Why can't you sit in the middle? GEORGE  Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl.  ELAINE  I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't you?  GEORGE  Is it that obvious?  (Elaine sits in the middle) ELAINE  Hello, Jerry. JERRY  Hello. ELAINE  Did you get a haircut? JERRY  No, shower. So, where are we eating?  ELAINE  Tell me if you think this is strange: There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or   something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little.. Nothing   much. Little pleasantries. He was a nice guy, he's got a family.. then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way.   polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn't nod. Like I don't exist?! He went from nods to nothing.  GEORGE  (imitating Tony Bennett) \"You know, I'd go from nods to nothing..\"  ELAINE  And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.  JERRY  A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened to The Blob.  GEORGE  I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.  ELAINE  Really? GEORGE  Yes. ELAINE  You would do that? GEORGE  If I was a different person.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone) JERRY  Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if..   (Other guy hangs up on Jerry; he redials; enter Kramer)  (The buzzer buzzes; Kramer answers it) KRAMER  Come on up. JERRY  (Into phone) Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance calls I made to you why   can't you.. (guy hangs up on Jerry again). (To Kramer) Why? Why do they just hang up like that?! Thank you very much.   (Kramer holds up cantaloupe) KRAMER  Taste this. JERRY  No, I just had a sandwich. KRAMER  No, taste it. Taste it. JERRY  I don't want cantaloupe now. KRAMER  You've never had cantaloupe like this before.  JERRY  I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.  KRAMER  Jerry. This is great cantaloupe. JERRY  Alright.. (tastes it) KRAMER  Ah, huh. It's good? JERRY  It's very good. KRAMER  Good, huh? JERRY  Good. KRAMER  I got it at Joe's. JERRY  Uh-Huh. KRAMER  Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go to Joe's.  JERRY  It's too far. KRAMER  It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..  JERRY  I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?  KRAMER  See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back.  JERRY  I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.   (Enter George; he's extremely excited - he's dancing around the room, singing the Zorba theme)  GEORGE  I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.  JERRY  You did it? What happened? GEORGE  I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word \"Listen.\"  JERRY  Ah ha. GEORGE  I said, \"Listen Marlene,\" and then the next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of me going: \"You're doing it! You're doing   it!\" And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry. The voice said \"Keep going, keep going. You're almost out!\" It's like I   was making a prison break, you know. And I'm heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get   the front door. I opened it up, I'm one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!  JERRY  See, it's never as bad as you imagine.  KRAMER  I liked Marlene. What's her number?  GEORGE  No, I, I don't think so.  (Kramer stants making noises while eating) JERRY  Could you stop that smacking? KRAMER  George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.  GEORGE  Oh no, thank you. KRAMER  It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.  GEORGE  No, really. No, no, thanks. KRAMER  Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.  JERRY  It's very good cantaloupe. (changing subject) So that's it? You're out?  GEORGE  Except for one small problem. I left some books in her apartment.  JERRY  So, go get them. GEORGE  Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could happen, I'd be right back   where I started. JERRY  So forget about the books. Did you read them?  GEORGE  Well, yeah. JERRY  What do you need them for? GEORGE  I don't know. They're books. JERRY  What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?  GEORGE  They're MY books. JERRY  So you want me to get those books? Is that it?   (Scene ends)  (Coffee Shop)  (Jerry and Marlene are sitting, a pile of books are on the table.)  MARLENE  ..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old   jeans and T-shirt. And I don't know, I was just in one of those moods - so I said to myself, \"Marlene, just do it,\" and I jumped in. And as I'm getting out, I feel all   these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.  JERRY  So what'd you do? MARLENE  Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was.  JERRY  Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.  MARLENE  (Laughs) Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.  JERRY  No. MARLENE  Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.   (Scene ends)  (Chiropractor waiting room) JERRY  (Irritated) I don't know how this happened.  GEORGE  Jerry, it's not my fault. JERRY  No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read   Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it's not like Marlene's a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we've   had like three lunches and a movie. And she never stops calling. (George nods - he knows exactly what Jerry's talking about) And it's these meaningless,   purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I'm busy or anything. I just pick up the phone and she's in the middle of a sentence.  GEORGE  That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?  JERRY  Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, \"Hello, Jerry?\" and I'll go \"Oh, hi Marlene.\" And then it's \"Jerry..\"  GEORGE  What about getting off the phone? JERRY  Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in the conversation where you can go, \"Alright, then.. \" You know, it just goes on and on and on with   out a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.  GEORGE  Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She is sexy though. Don't you think?  JERRY  Yeah. Yes, she is.  (Receptionist enters) RECEPTIONIST  Mr. Costanza? GEORGE  Yeah. RECEPTIONIST  The doctor'll see you now. GEORGE  (To Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? (Picks up a crossword puzzle) I better take this. I   hate the little room. \"Oh, hello, Doctor.\"  (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says \"Waiting room.\" There's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting   room, they're going to use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You pretend you're   reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. You know, you're thinking about about them things like \"I wonder what he's got. As soon as she goes, I'm   getting her magazine.\" And then, they finally call you and it's a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other   people in the room. \"Well, I guess I've been chosen. I'll see you all later.\" You know, so you think you're going to see the doctor, but you're not, are you? No.   You're going into the next waiting room. The littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest   room that they have, I think. You don't wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have,   with like, stadium seating? You don't want them doing antying to you that makes other doctors go, \"I have to see this!\" \"Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do   that to him?\" \"Are there seats? Can we get in?\" Do they scalp tickets to these things? \"I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two..\"   (Scene ends)  (Waiting room)  (George returns) JERRY  So, how was it? GEORGE  I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. (Imitating doctor) Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.  JERRY  Well, it's a first visit. GEORGE  What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only paying half.  JERRY  You can't do that. GEORGE  Why not? JERRY  He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.  GEORGE  Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's car) MARLENE  Are you feeling weird? JERRY  No, I'm fine. MARLENE  Nothing really happened. JERRY  Yeah, I know. MARLENE  We just kissed a little. People kiss.  JERRY  Yeah. MARLENE  Well.. night.  (Leans over and kisses Jerry) JERRY  Good night.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Kramer enters with a golf club) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  I got it! This time, I got it! JERRY  Alright. KRAMER  Hips! See, it's all hips. JERRY  Uh-huh. KRAMER  You gotta come through with the hips first. (Demonstrates)  JERRY  That is out there.  (Kramer notices Jerry's eating cantaloupe, his eyes light up)  KRAMER  Joe's? JERRY  No, supermarket. KRAMER  Well, is it good? JERRY  It's okay. KRAMER  Let me taste it. (Takes a bite, spits it out) See, that stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back.  JERRY  I'm not taking it back. KRAMER  Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there.  JERRY  I don't care about it. KRAMER  Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.  JERRY  Alright. Take it back.  (Phone rings, Jerry is reluctant to answer it) JERRY  (On his answering machine) Leave a message, I'll call you back.  MARLENE  (Leaving a message) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back.  KRAMER  Well? JERRY  Marlene KRAMER  (Smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene. JERRY  Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a little bit in the car.  KRAMER  I thought you were trying to get rid of her?  JERRY  I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized.  KRAMER  Does George know? JERRY  No, he'd go nuts. KRAMER  Yeah, no kidding. JERRY  I feel terrible. (Kramer smiles) I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. I've just got this like,   psycho-sexual hold over me. I just want her, I can't breathe. It's like a drug.  KRAMER  Woah, psycho-sexual. JERRY  I don't know how I'm going to tell him.  KRAMER  Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?  JERRY  It's partially you, yeah. KRAMER  You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.  JERRY  Well, he can't kill me, right? KRAMER  You're a human being. JERRY  I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it.  KRAMER  You're flesh and blood. JERRY  I'm a nice guy.  (Enter Elaine, she's holding a lamp) ELAINE  Hi. (Hands Jerry the lamp) JERRY  Oh, my little airplane lamp. ELAINE  You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.  JERRY  Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.  ELAINE  Unless you're married to a dictator..  JERRY  Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.  ELAINE  Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe.  KRAMER  Nope. No good. JERRY  Well, you know what they say: Luck in love, Unlucky with fruit.  KRAMER  Well, I'm taking this back. (Leaves)  ELAINE  So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.  JERRY  Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?  ELAINE  Yep. JERRY  You talked to him? ELAINE  Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought \"no, no, no, no. Do not be afraid of this man.\"  JERRY  Right. ELAINE  So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, \"Hi, remember me?\" And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it   out. So I said to him, I said, \"You little phony. You know exactly who I am.\"  JERRY  \"You little phony\"? ELAINE  I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, \"Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once.\" And I said, \"Well, how do you go from that to   totally ignoring a person when they walk by?\" JERRY  Amazing. ELAINE  And he says, he says, \"Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, alright?\" And I said, \"Fine. Fine I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I   wanted you to know that I'm aware of it.\"  (Elaine tastes some cantaloupe) JERRY  You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now.  ELAINE  This cantaloupe stinks. (Spits it out)   (Scene ends)  (Coffee Shop) GEORGE  I don't care. JERRY  You're kidding. GEORGE  No, I don't care. JERRY  You mean that? GEORGE  Absolutely. JERRY  You don't care? GEORGE  No. JERRY  How could you not care? GEORGE  I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.  JERRY  I thought you'd be upset. GEORGE  I guess I should be but I'm not. JERRY  Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?  GEORGE  No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy.  JERRY  That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.  GEORGE  I know, I know. JERRY  So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?  GEORGE  See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me.  JERRY  Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking about her.  GEORGE  I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.  JERRY  Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.  GEORGE  (Angry) You paid that crook?! JERRY  I had to. GEORGE  He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that?  JERRY  It was embarrassing to me. GEORGE  I was trying to make a point. JERRY  Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps) What's wrong?  GEORGE  (Gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's car) JERRY  ..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?  MARLENE  ..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to work.  JERRY  Really? I thought.. MARLENE  I know, I'm sorry. JERRY  I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.  MARLENE  You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.  JERRY  Of course I want to talk about it.  MARLENE  Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.  JERRY  Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?  MARLENE  ..I saw your act. JERRY  My act? What does that have to do with anything?  MARLENE  Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff.  JERRY  I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?  MARLENE  I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.  JERRY  You're a cashier! MARLENE  Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor.  JERRY  You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.  MARLENE  I heard the material. JERRY  I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony  bogus names for the jobs that we have. \"Well, right now, I'm the regional management supervisor.\" \"I'm in development, research, consulting.\" Men on the other  hand, if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don't really care. Men'll just go, \"Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that  where you work? That sounds interesting. So whatdya got a big cleaver there? You're just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don't you shower up, and we'll get some burgers  and catch a movie.\"   THE END>",

        "text": "  THE PONY REMARK Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Night club) JERRY  My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, and that's the law. You know   how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, \"Let's go Pop, white belt, white pants, white   shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there, drop it!\" I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation's so boring.   It's so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, what if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the   glass.. You know. Come back in, there's broken glass, everybody's all upset. \"No, I'm alright. I was just a little bored, there. No, I'm fine. I came back. I wanted to   hear a little about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let's pick it up right there.\"   (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's parents are in town. His father's watching T.V., his mother is ironing his father's jackets)  HELEN  (To Morty) You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? (He doesn't respond) What's   wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear - this!   (Phone rings) MORTY  Are you getting that? HELEN  I thought you were getting it. MORTY  Should I pick up? HELEN  You want me to get that? MORTY  I'll get it! HELEN  I'll get it!  (They both go for the phone, Helen gets to it first) HELEN  Hello?.. Hello?  (She hangs up. Jerry enters - he's wearing baseball clothes and carrying a bat and glove)  JERRY  (Talking about the loud T.V.) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street! (Turns it off)  MORTY  So, how'd you do? JERRY  We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be in the championship   game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment of my life.  HELEN  This is your greatest moment? A game?  JERRY  Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.  MORTY  You know what my greatest moment was, don't you? 1946. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trench coat.  HELEN  Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?  JERRY  Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he's doing.  HELEN  But it's their 50th anniversary. MORTY  You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.  JERRY  First of all, I made plans with Elaine.  HELEN  So bring her. JERRY  I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I've met them three times in my life.  MORTY  I don't know her either. (Gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.  HELEN  At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave.  MORTY  How come he gets to leave? JERRY  If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the   middle of his conversation. MORTY  And it's always about Jeffrey, right?  JERRY  Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.   (Enter Kramer) KRAMER  Morty, are you coming in? MORTY  Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it. KRAMER  (To Jerry) Hey, how'd you do? JERRY  We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..  KRAMER  Yeah! JERRY  (To Kramer and Morty) What is this about?  KRAMER  I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.  JERRY  What are you doing? KRAMER  Levels. JERRY  Levels? KRAMER  Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You   know, like ancient Egypt. JERRY  You drew up plans for this? KRAMER  No, no. It's all in my head. MORTY  I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.  KRAMER  Oh, I'll be comfortable. JERRY  When do you intend to do this? KRAMER  Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.  JERRY  You're doing this yourself? KRAMER  It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?  JERRY  Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.  KRAMER  Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.  MORTY  Hey, that's some big job. JERRY  I don't see it happening. KRAMER  Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even bet you.  JERRY  Seriously? HELEN  I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet.  KRAMER  A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of the month.  JERRY  I'll give you a year. KRAMER  No, no, no. End of the month. JERRY  It's a bet. (They both \"pinkie swear\" to lock the deal)   (Scene ends)  (Manya's apartment)  (Jerry sits between Uncle Leo and Elaine. Leo grabs his choulder)  JERRY  Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?  ELAINE  No, no. I'm fine. LEO  Jerry, are you listening to this? JERRY  Yeah, Uncle Leo. LEO  So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.  JERRY  Right. For reducing the pond scum?  LEO  No, for the walking tours. JERRY  Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible foliage tour.  LEO  That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever   he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?  JERRY  Mickey Mantle? ELAINE  (Helping him worm out of the conversation with Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!  JERRY  (Eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country-fresh flavor.  ELAINE  Mmm.. phenomenal peas.. MORTY  Are you ready for dessert? JERRY  Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.  MANYA  (Surprised) You're going? ELAINE  I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.  JERRY  Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance.  MANYA  Can't dance? HELEN  He's kidding, Manya. MANYA  Is that a joke? HELEN  (Canging subject) So, did you hear Claire's getting married?  MANYA  Yeah, yeah.. HELEN  I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.  JERRY  Horses. They're like big riding dogs.  ELAINE  What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies..  JERRY  I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.  MANYA  ..I had a pony.  (The room is dead quiet) JERRY  ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se.  MANYA  (Angry) When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with that?  JERRY  Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..  HELEN  Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?  MANYA  He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.  JERRY  Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?  MANYA  You! You said so! JERRY  No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..  MANYA  That's it! I've had enough! (She leaves the room)  ISAAC  Have your coffee, everyone. She's a little upset. It's been an emotional day.   (Isaac leaves, everyone looks at Jerry) JERRY  I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on   that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come   hre if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn't make sense.. am I wrong?   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Morty and Helen are leaving, their bags are packed) JERRY  I'll drive you to the airport. HELEN  No, we're taking a cab. JERRY  I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.  HELEN  Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.  MORTY  Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.  JERRY  Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.  HELEN  You know, you should give Manya a call.  JERRY  Maybe I will.  (Jerry opens his door, Kramer's standing in the hallway) KRAMER  Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye. (Gestures to the bags) ..Need any help with those?  MORTY  It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?  KRAMER  Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it.  JERRY  (Sarcastically) Really? What a shock.  HELEN  Goodbye, Jerry. JERRY  Take care. HELEN  We'll call you. (Leaves) MORTY  Bye, Jer. JERRY  Bye, Dad. Take it easy. MORTY  Bye, Mr. Kramer. KRAMER  Yeah. So long, Morty. (Morty leaves)  JERRY  So, when do I get my dinner? KRAMER  There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.  JERRY  Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.  KRAMER  There's not bet if I' not doing it.  JERRY  That's the bet! That you're not doing it!  KRAMER  Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it.  JERRY  We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.  KRAMER  And it could be done. JERRY  Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is the levels.  KRAMER  But I don't want the levels! JERRY  That's the bet! (Phone rings, Jerry answers it) Hello? ..No, oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe I can still catch them. (Jerry   goes over to the window, and opens it. He yells out of it) Ma!.. Ma!.. Up here! Don't get in the cab! .. Manya died! ..Manya died!!   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment) HELEN  Who did you talk to? JERRY  Uncle Leo. HELEN  And when's the funeral? JERRY  I don't know. He said he'd call back.  MORTY  You know what this means, don't you? We lost the supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.  HELEN  She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..  JERRY  What? HELEN  What? Nothing. JERRY  You don't think.. What? The pony remark?  HELEN  Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman.  JERRY  You don't think that I killed her?  MORTY  You know what the flight back'll cost us?  JERRY  It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a pony!  MORTY  Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.  JERRY  The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. (Phone rings) That's probably Uncle Leo.   (Helen picks it up) HELEN  Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. Sure, sure, we'll see you then. (Hangs up) The funeral's Wednesday.  JERRY  Wednesday? What, what Wednesday? HELEN  Two o' clock, Wednesday. (Jerry shrugs) What?  JERRY  I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.  HELEN  So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.  JERRY  I didn't even know the woman. HELEN  So don't go. JERRY  I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.  HELEN  Jery, no one's forcing you. JERRY  I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything.  HELEN  I don't have a dress to wear. (To Morty) And you. You don't have anything.  MORTY  I got a sport jacket. HELEN  You're not wearing that to a funeral.  MORTY  What's wrong with it? HELEN  It looks ridiculous. MORTY  What? I'm gonna buy a new jacket now?  JERRY  I don't know what to do. MORTY  ..You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can't stretch out and   get some solid rest at that point, I don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. No is he going to a   meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let's make up our mind where we think they're going.   (Scene ends)  (Coffee Shop) ELAINE  I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time's your game?  JERRY  Two Forty-Five. ELAINE  And what time's the funeral? JERRY  Two o' clock. ELAINE  How long does a funeral take? JERRY  Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.  ELAINE  So you cna't do both? JERRY  You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. I would   understand. ELAINE  How can you even consider not going?  GEORGE  You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? I   just don't see how it could occur. ELAINE  You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.  GEORGE  They always make me take stock of my life and how I've pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.  JERRY  I know, and then you say to yourself, \"From this moment on, I'm not going to waste any more of it.\" But then you go, \"How? What can I do that's not   wasting it?\" ELAINE  Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't you hae coffee with people?  GEORGE  You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. We need you. You're hitting everything.  ELAINE  He has to go. He may have killed her.  JERRY  Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.  ELAINE  Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one.  GEORGE  (To Jerry) Who's going to play left field?  JERRY  Bender. GEORGE  Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who's at the   funeral? They don't even know they're having a funeral. It's not like she's hanging out in the back going, \"I can't believe Jerry didn't show up.\"  ELAINE  Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?  GEORGE  If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's going to want to hang   around Drexler's funeral home on Ocean Parkway? ELAINE  George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other dimensions.  GEORGE  You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental.  JERRY  Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.  ELAINE  Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?  JERRY  I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War II. The rent's three hundred a month.  ELAINE  Three hundred a month? Oh my God.  (Scene ends)  (Funeral home)  (The eulogy is in progress. Jerry attended afterall) MAN  Although this may seem like a sad even, it should not be a day of mourning.. for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world - a simpler   world - with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony.. (Jerry throws his hands up) Oh, how she loved that   pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It's lustrous coat, it's flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow. (Jery   sinks in his seat)  (Scene ends)  (Anteroom of funeral parlor) JERRY  (Looking at his watch) Well, the game's starting just about now.  HELEN  It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.   (Scene cuts to Morty talking to an intern) INTERN  I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I'm just an intern. I can't write a note to an airline.  MORTY  You've got your degree. They don't care. They just want to see something.   (Scene cuts back to Jerry) JERRY  (To Isaac) I just wanted to say how sorry I was..  LEO  (Interrupting) Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside - so he'll completely revamp that   operation, you understand? He'll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. It's more money. So, that's your cousin.   (Scene cuts back to Morty) MORTY  You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare.  JERRY  (To Isaac) Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am abou tthe other night.  ELAINE  Oh, me too. ISAAC  Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about that. She was much mor upset about the potato salad.  ELAINE  So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?   (Jerry shake his head and walks away) ISAAC  Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked Phoenix.  ELAINE  Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with your apartment?  ISAAC  Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave to get an air conditioner.  ELAINE  Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?  ISAAC  Although they say it's a dry heat.  ELAINE  Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?  ISAAC  I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.  ELAINE  I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it.   (Jerry comes back) ISAAC  Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey's taking the apartment.  ELAINE  (to Jerry) Oh, Jeffrey. JERRY  (To Elaine) You know Jeffery? ELAINE  Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.   (Helen approaches Jerry) HELEN  It's raining. JERRY  (Moves to the window) It's raining? It's raining. The game will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow.   (Scene cuts back to Morty) MORTY  Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.  INTERN  I can't. I'll get in trouble. MORTY  Oh, for God's sakes!  (Scene ends)  (Coffee Shop) GEORGE  Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of.  JERRY  It's never happend to me before. ELAINE  I remember saying to myself, \"Why is Jerry so far off the base?\"  JERRY  I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.  GEORGE  And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?  JERRY  I thought there were two outs. ELAINE  I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.  JERRY  It was the single worst moment of my life.  GEORGE  What about Sharon Besser? JERRY  Oh, well, of course. 1973. ELAINE  Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?  JERRY  Wonder about what? ELAINE  You know.. the spirit world. JERRY  You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?  ELAINE  I never saw anyone play like that.  JERRY  But I went ot the funeral. ELAINE  Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her.  GEORGE  Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.  JERRY  Don't you think she would've heard I was there?  GEORGE  Not necessarily. (Elaine laughs) JERRY  Who figures and immigrant's gonna have a pony?   (Scene ends)  (Night Club) JERRY  What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why   ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don't use them for, you know, crowd control. \"Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey!   Hey, little boy. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Behind the barricades!\" So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them   any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn't it? Just have a little pony and   you put him on the, \"Baltic, that's two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right ther, Baltic. yeah, that's it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.\"     THE END>",

        "text": "  THE JACKET Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Night club) JERRY  I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think   eventually fashion won't even exist. It won't. I think eventually we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there's people   from the future of another planet, they're all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided \"This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and   boots. That's it.\" We should come up for an outfit for earth. An earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits, no speeches. They walk out,   twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, \"That was nice. I could wear that.\"   (Scene ends)  (Clothing store) JERRY  I think I've seen enough. SALESMAN  Well, I might have something in the back.  ELAINE  The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front.  JERRY  Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, \"Just Back.\" All back. No front. You walk in the front, you're immediately in the back. (Picks   up a tie display) Look, Elaine, tie car wash. CUSTOMER  (Sees the book Elaine is holding) Oh, I just read that. That's terrific.  JERRY  (Pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.  CUSTOMER  Alton Benes is your father? ELAINE  Yeah. CUSTOMER  I always felt he deserved a wider audience.  ELAINE  I'm not so sure he wants one. (Customer leaves) Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o' clock.  JERRY  ..I guess I'm coming.. I mean.. ELAINE  What? What, you don't want to go now?  JERRY  No, I'll go. I'm going. ELAINE  No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't seen my father in a while and.. you know.  JERRY  I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits.  ELAINE  So, that's why we're not togeter anymore.  JERRY  (Looks at a jacket) What is this? (Holds it up) This is beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right.  ELAINE  Try it on. (Feels it) Wow, this is soft suede.  JERRY  This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. (Elaine grabs the tag) How much is it?  ELAINE  (Shocked) Oh my God. JERRY  Bad? (Elaine nods) ..Very bad? ELAINE  You have no idea. JERRY  I have some idea. ELAINE  No idea. JERRY  I've got a ballpark. ELAINE  There is no park and the team has relocated.  JERRY  (Looks at the tag) ..That is high.  ELAINE  Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.  JERRY  (Looking at the insides of the jacket) What's with the pink lining and the candy stripes?  ELAINE  Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed.  JERRY  Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual voices now, you know. \"What about the money?\" \"What's money?\"  SALESMAN  It looks wonderful on you.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's sitting on his couch wearing his pajamas and his new jacket. He gets up to look at his jacket in the mirror. Kramer enters)  JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Hey. New jacket? JERRY  What do you think? KRAMER  It's beautiful. JERRY  Is it me? KRAMER  That's definitely you. JERRY  Really? KRAMER  That's more you than you've ever been. (Starts looking the jacket over) What is with the pink lining?  JERRY  I don't know. It's got a pink lining.  KRAMER  Oh.. So, what did you pay for this?  JERRY  I paid what it costs. KRAMER  How much? JERRY  What's the difference? KRAMER  What, you're not gonna tell me? JERRY  I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.  KRAMER  Over three hundred? JERRY  Yes, but let's just stop it right there.  KRAMER  It's over four hundred? JERRY  Really, I'm not answering anymore.  KRAMER  Is it over four hundred? JERRY  Would you? KRAMER  (Finds the tag) Woah, Nelson! JERRY  I know, I know. KRAMER  (Talking about his old jacket) What are you gonna do with the leather one?  JERRY  I don't know. KRAMER  Well, are you gonna wear it? JERRY  Maybe. KRAMER  (Looking over the leather jacket) You're not going to wear this.  JERRY  Do you want it? KRAMER  Well, yeah. Okay. I'll take it.. I like the jacket.  JERRY  (Takes one last look at the leather jacket) ..Okay, take it.  KRAMER  Good karma for you. (Kramer puts on his new jacket, and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (George enters singing \"Master Of the House\" - a Les Miserables show tune)  GEORGE  \"Master of the house.. doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm. Tells a saucy talke, loves to make a stir everyone appreciates a..\"  JERRY  What is that song? GEORGE  Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last wee. I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no   control over it. I'm singing it on elevators, buses. I sing it infront of clients. It's taking over my life.  JERRY  You know, Schumann went mad from that.  GEORGE  Artie Schumann? From Camp Hatchapee?  JERRY  No, you idiot. GEORGE  What are you, Bud Abbott? What, are you calling my an idiot?  JERRY  You don't know Rober Schumann? The composer?  GEORGE  Oh, Schumann. Of course. JERRY  (Trying to scare George) He went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He   had to be institutionalized. GEORGE  Really? ..Well, what if it doesn't stop? (Jerry gestures \"That's the breaks.\" George gasps) Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! Alright, just   say something. Just start talking. Change the subject.. Let's just go, alright? I can't believe we're having dinner with Alton Benes.  JERRY  I know exactly what's goin to happen tonight. I'm gonna try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through it.  GEORGE  Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet show.  JERRY  Let me just get my jacket. (Moves to the bedroom)  GEORGE  \"Master of the house, keeper of the inn..\" (Jerry proudly models his new jacket infront of George. George looks in admiration at the jacket) This is huge!   When did this happen? JERRY  Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been   a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet an social challenge.  GEORGE  (Nods) Can I say one thing to you? And I say this wiht an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.  JERRY  Absolutely. GEORGE  ..It's fabulous. JERRY  I know. GEORGE  And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me when you feel comfortable.. So   what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry's acting coy throughout the whole thing) Over six? Can't be seven. Don't tell my   you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you're saying to me?! You are sick! Is that what you   paid for this jacket?! Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket? I won't say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A   thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! Alright, fine. I'm walking out of here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket,   unless you tell me different. (Jerry still coy, stays silent) Oh, ho! Alright! I'll tell you what, if you don't say anything in the next five seconds, I'll know it was over a   thousand..  (Enter Kramer) KRAMER  Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?  JERRY  Well, what kind of solid? KRAMER  I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.  JERRY  Birds? KRAMER  Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.  JERRY  So take a cab. KRAMER  They won't take a cage full of birds.  JERRY  I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.  KRAMER  George, do me a solid? Two minutes.  GEORGE  Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done a solid before.  KRAMER  Alright.. yeah.. alright, have a good one.   (Kramer leaves) JERRY  (Scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes.. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.   (Scene ends)  (Hotel lobby)  (Jerry and George enter. George's singing \"Master of the House\")  GEORGE  \"Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by.\"  JERRY  (Points to his head) Schumann. (George gets visibly scared) Where are they?  GEORGE  Maybe he didn't show up. JERRY  What, you don't want to do this? GEORGE  I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.  GEORGE  (Sees an elderly man sitting on a leather chair) Wait a second, is that him?  JERRY  Yeah, I think it is. (They walk tward him) Where's Elaine?  GEORGE  I'm nervous. JERRY  Excuse me.. Mister Benes? ALTON  Yeah? JERRY  I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.  GEORGE  (Holds out his hand for a handshake) It's a great thrill to meet you, Sir.   (Alton starts hacking, George withdraws his hand) ALTON  Sit down. Want a drink? JERRY  Sure. ALTON  (Summons waiter) What do you have?  JERRY  (To waiter) I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.  GEORGE  And, I'll have a club soda with no ice.  BENES  (Gives both Jerry and George a look) I'll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.  GEORGE  You like ice? ALTON  Huh? GEORGE  I said, do you like ice? ALTON  Like it? GEORGE  Don't you think you get more without it?  ALTON  (Pauses) Where's Elaine? JERRY  Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually pretty punctual. (Alton remains quiet) ..Don't you find that, George?  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes.  JERRY  Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's late.  GEORGE  I guess today she's late. JERRY  It appears that way. GEORGE  Yep. JERRY  Yep.  (Both Jerry and George look at the door, anticipating Elaine's arrival)  ALTON  Looks like rain. GEORGE  (Perks up) I know, I know, that's what they said.  ALTON  Who said? GEORGE  The weather guy, Dr. Waldo. ALTON  I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain.  GEORGE  No, of course not. I didn't.. ALTON  All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (Waiter shows up with the drinks) Which one's suppose to be the funny guy?  GEORGE  (Pointing at Jerry) Oh, he's the comedian.  JERRY  I'm just a regular person. GEORGE  No, no. He's just being modest. ALTON  We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. (Long pause) There's nothing funny about that.   (Jerry and George turn to the door again) JERRY  Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.   (Jerry leaves. George is left alone with Alton) GEORGE  I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.  ALTON  Drivel. GEORGE  Maybe some parts. ALTON  What parts? GEORGE  The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you.. (Gets up, and leaves)   (Scene cuts to the hotel bathroom) GEORGE  Thank you for leaving me alone with him!  JERRY  That was brutal. I can't go back out there.  GEORGE  Well, let's just leave. JERRY  Elaine'll kill me. GEORGE  Where is she? JERRY  She's gotta be here soon. GEORGE  How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.  JERRY  The waiter was trembling. GEORGE  If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with him alone.  JERRY  How are we gonna get out of it? GEORGE  We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.  JERRY  Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.  GEORGE  I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, \"To hell with the   world, I can make my own people. I'll eat whatever I want. I'll wear whatever I want, and I'll create whoever I want.\"   (Scene ends)  (Hotel lobby)  (Jerry and George come back from the bathroom) ALTON  Who'd you call? GEORGE  (Caught off guard) My uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.  ALTON  What kind of operation? GEORGE  Bone marrow.  (Manager approaches) MANAGER  Mister Benes? ALTON  Yes? MANAGER  A message for you. (Hands him a message)  ALTON  From Elaine. She got tied up. She'll be here in thirty minutes. (Jerry and George freeze)   (Scene ends)  (Hotel lobby) ALTON  Yeah, they should've taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in 'fifty-three.  JERRY  (Adding) Well, Guatamala. GEORGE  Sure, Guatamala. ALTON  (Gets up) Alright, you boys get yourselves together. We'll head up to the restaurant. I'll leave a note for Elaine. I'm going to the bathroom. (Leaves)  GEORGE  Come on, let's go! JERRY  What about Elaine? GEORGE  To hell with Elaine! JERRY  She'll be furious. GEORGE  We're dying here!  (Elaine enters) JERRY  That's her! She's here! ELAINE  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?  GEORGE  (Mocking Alton's voice) He's in the bathroom.  JERRY  Where have you been?! ELAINE  Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds..  JERRY  Oh, you didn't.. ELAINE  Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me   to get out of the car. He's a city marshal. He's towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car!   So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car.. so, finally, he finally   comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet. So, we're wandering around trying   to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we're running down the street after these doves. I almost got hit by a bus. (Sits down, takes a deep breath) ..So   how's everything going over here? JERRY  (After hearing Elaine's story, his is..) Great.  GEORGE  Couldn't be better. ELAINE  Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.  JERRY  Oh, no, no. GEORGE  Get outta here.. ELAINE  Man, Kramer! I could kill him. JERRY  I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.  ELAINE  He said he'd give me a lift. JERRY  Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?  GEORGE  Where do you come up with this stuff?  ALTON  (Returns) Well, look who's here. ELAINE  Oh, Hi, Dad. ALTON  (Kisses Elaine) Hello, dear. Who's the lipstick for?  ELAINE  No one. ALTON  ..How's your mother? ELAINE  Fine. ALTON  How about you? Are you working? ELAINE  Yeah, I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.  ALTON  Pendant, those bastards.. Alright, boys. We'll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You're not afraid of a little spice, are you?   (They all head for the door. Jerry and George trail behind a little)  GEORGE  \"Master of the house, doling out the charm. Ready with a handshake and an open..\"  ALTON  Pipe down, chorus boy.  (Alton glares, George gets embarrassed) ELAINE  Ohh.. it's snowing. It's beautiful.  JERRY  (To George) Snow.. snow, that can't be good for suede, can it?  GEORGE  I wouldn't think so. JERRY  What should I do? (To Alton) We're taking a cab, aren't we?  ALTON  Cab? It's only five blocks. GEORGE  (To Jerry) Why don't you just turn it inside out?  JERRY  Inside out! Great.  (Jery turns his jacket inside out, showing of the pink striped insides. Alton stops him before Jerry can leave the hotel)  ALTON  Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?  JERRY  Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.  ALTON  Well, you look like a damn fool! JERRY  (Like a child) Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.  ALTON  Well, you're not going to walk down the street with my and my daughter dressed like that! That's for damn sure!   (Jerry looks at George) GEORGE  It's only a few blocks.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's heading out, the intercom buzzes) JERRY  (Into intercom) Elaine? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Come on up.  (Enter Kramer) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  I've gotta feed the birds. JERRY  So?.. KRAMER  You got any of those mini Ritzes?  (Jerry reaches up, and pulls out some mini Ritzes) JERRY  I can't believe I do. KRAMER  Yeah! ..Well, are you going out? JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Hey, where's your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. It's ruined, and unwearable) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom,   he's shocked at the sight of the jacket) Ohhh. What did you do to it?  JERRY  I was out in the snow last night. KRAMER  Don't youk now what that does to suede?  JERRY  I have an idea. (Elaine enters) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema III.  ELAINE  Okay.. (To Kramer) Hello. (To Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.  JERRY  Is he still in town? ELAINE  No, he's driving back to Maryland tonight.  KRAMER  (Talking about the ruined jacket) So, uh.. what are you gonna do with that one now?  JERRY  I don't know. KRAMER  Well?.. ELAINE  (To Jerry) I didn't want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.  JERRY  Really? KRAMER  You gonna throw this out? JERRY  Well, I can't wear it. ELAINE  (To Jerry) Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.  KRAMER  Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.  JERRY  Yeah, go ahead, take it. ELAINE  Dad thinks George is gay. JERRY  Oh, because of all that singing? ELAINE  No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.   (Kramer returns from the bathroom wearing the ruined suede jacket)  KRAMER  Hey, see, I like it like this. ELAINE  (Pointing at the jacket Kramer's wearing) Isnt' that..? (Jerry nods) Oh, is this fromt he snow last night? (Jerry nods again) Ugh.. you know what you   should've done? You should've turned it inside out. JERRY  I'll try and remember that. KRAMER  (Talking about the leather jacket from the start of the show) Boy, it's too bad you gave me this one too.  JERRY  (Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad. KRAMER  I'm gonna have to do something about this lining.   (Kramer exits, Scene ends)  (Alton Benes' car)  (Alton is driving home, then all the sudden, he starts to sing)  ALTON  \"Master of the house doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm..\"   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don't get this. Aren't cows ouside most of the time? I don't understand it.   When it's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, \"Let us in, we're all wearing leather.. Open the door! We're gonna ruin the whole outfit here..\" \"Is it suede?\" \"I am   suede, the whole thing is suede, I can't have this cleaned. It's all I got!\" THE END>",

        "text": "           THE PHONE MESSAGE Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Comedy club)  The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is   doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see anybody on TV   like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their   commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them?   \"We have soda, we have soda, we have soda\", jumping, laughing, flying through   the air - it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're   watching TV and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising   right there on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,   jetskiing, girls in bikinis and I'm standing there - \"Maybe I'm putting too much   ice in mine.\" GEORGE  So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there,   and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her   out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I   interpret it like they're Psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm   supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like -   remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? - that's what   I looked like. JERRY  So you didn't ask? GEORGE  No, I froze. JERRY  (Points to counter) Counter. GEORGE  Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the office,   I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says \"So why don't you call her\". I says \"I   can't.\" I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I   gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks.   So Lloyd calls me a wuss. JERRY  He said wuss? GEORGE  Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.  JERRY  So you called. (They sit at counter)  GEORGE  Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple,   because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it   makes you sound casual. JERRY  Yeah, like a farm boy. GEORGE  Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives me an   enthusiastic 'Hi!' JERRY  Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful.  GEORGE  Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there.  JERRY  Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic   'Hi!' Go ahead. GEORGE  So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before I ask them   out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out \"What are you   doing Saturday night?\" JERRY  And? GEORGE  She bought. JERRY  Great day in the morning. GEORGE  Then I got off the phone right away.  JERRY  Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you don't loiter around in front of   the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.  GEORGE  It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night. I can't   remember the last time that happened.  George's car, parked outside apartment building, night. George and his date  CAROL GEORGE  I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of   underwear. CAROL  You do not. GEORGE  Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying   underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I   only have to do wash once a year.  (They both laugh)  Jerry's car, also parked outside an apartment building. Jerry and his  GIRLFRIEND DONNA JERRY  (In awful Scots/Irish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try   a Scottish accent. DONNA  That's Irish. JERRY  Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie?   (Donna laughs) DONNA  So, er, thanks for dinner. It was great.  GEORGE  Yeah. We should do this again. DONNA  Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?  GEORGE  Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.  DONNA  (Looks disappointed) So, um, OK. GEORGE  OK. DONNA  Goodnight. GEORGE  Yeah, take it easy.  (Donna leaves car. George realizes what he has done and bashes his   forehead in disgust) DONNA  Thanks again for the movie. JERRY  You're welcome. DONNA  I'd invite you up, but the place is being painted.  JERRY  Oh, that's OK. DONNA  Unless you want to go to your place.  JERRY  OK, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking   for. GEORGE  Take it easy, huh, take it easy. JERRY  I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is   leave a note - it's common courtesy. I don't know, that's just the way I was   brought up. DONNA  Values are very important. JERRY  Oh, so important. So what are you doing Thursday night - you wanna   have dinner? DONNA  Thursday's great. (Moves closer) JERRY  (Looks at his pants) Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I   don't feel comfortable in them. DONNA  Are those Cotton Dockers? JERRY  Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.  DONNA  Really? I like that commercial. (Jerry pauses)  JERRY  You like that commercial? DONNA  Yeah, it's clever. JERRY  Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing   around, supposedly being very casual and witty? DONNA  Yeah, that's the one. JERRY  What could you possibly like about that?  DONNA  I don't know, I like the guys. JERRY  Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I   could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and   wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.  DONNA  Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.  JERRY  (Shrugs. Pause) Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if   somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with   the pants? Doesn't that bother you? DONNA  (Increasingly annoyed) That's the idea. That's what's clever about   it, that they're not talking about the pants. JERRY  But they're talking about nothing.  DONNA  That's the point. JERRY  I know the point. DONNA  No one is telling you to like it. JERRY  I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants,   pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?   (Donna sighs, leans away from Jerry, looks at watch) JERRY MONOLOGUE  What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other   through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future,   you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy'll be like   'I don't think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the   rest of my life?' And of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking 'What   is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my   life?' JERRY  I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with   someone who actually likes this commercial? ELAINE  I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean   enough. JERRY  No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?  ELAINE  Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his  TUB  germs were building a town in there - they were constructing offices.   Houses near the drain were going for $150,000.  (George enters, looking miserable, holding a brown paper bag)  ELAINE  Hi.  (George produces Pepto-Bismol bottle and box of bicarb from bag, places   them on counter) JERRY  You're still thinking about this? GEORGE  (While preparing bicarb) She invites me up at twelve o clock at   night, for coffee. And I don't go up. \"No thank you, I don't want coffee, it   keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee.\" I said this to her. People   this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. I can't imagine what she must think   of me. JERRY  She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.  GEORGE  She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex.  ELAINE  Maybe coffee was coffee. GEORGE  Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve o clock at   night. ELAINE  Well some people drink coffee that late.  GEORGE  Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile   kept saying to myself \"Keep it up, don't blow it, you're doing great.\"  ELAINE  It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I   think you should call her. GEORGE  I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call.  ELAINE  Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.  GEORGE  Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who   goes (in stupid voice) \"Oh no, I don't drink coffee late at night.\" If I call   her now, she's gonna think I'm too needy.  Women don't wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy - a colonel, a   kaiser, a tsar. ELAINE  All she'll think is that you like her.  GEORGE  Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like   me! ELAINE  I don't know what your parents did to you.   (Kramer enters, points at Jerry) KRAMER  Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. Alright,   you're up there, you're on the stage and you go \"Hey, you ever notice how cars   here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore.   Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking 'Well, sorry buddy,   you should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages   for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.'\" So you gonna use it?  JERRY  I don't think so. KRAMER  It's funny. ELAINE  It is funny. KRAMER  That's as good as anything you do.  GEORGE  Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.  JERRY  Why do we have to leave? GEORGE  Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come   on, let's go. ELAINE  Oh, see, this is the problem. JERRY  You're kicking me out of my house?  GEORGE  Yes. ELAINE  Don't forget. GEORGE  Oh Jerry, do you have any apples? JERRY  Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples.   (Elaine, Kramer and Jerry leave. George removes jacket, dials phone)  PHONE  Hi, it's Carol, I 'll get back to you. (Beep)  GEORGE  Uhm, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that   didn't come up for coffee.  You see, I didn't realise that coffee didn't really mean ... well,   whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was, erm, it was fun, so, oh boy, uhm, so,   you call me back. If you want, it's up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do.   Either way. The ball's in your court. So, er, take it easy.   (Hangs up. Jerry enters) JERRY  I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. What's the   matter, did you call?  (Elaine enters) GEORGE  Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm dead,   I'm a dead man. Dead man. JERRY  What did you say? GEORGE  I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and   there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right  NOW  'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!'  JERRY  After one date you try and improvise on her machine?  GEORGE  Now I'm in the worst position of all.  ELAINE  Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine,   and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to, and it would   have cost him $15,000, so he waited outside the guy's house and when the guy   came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.  GEORGE  He did that? ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  Somebody did that? JERRY  She'll call you back. You're overreacting.  JERRY  Not once. DONNA  Never? JERRY  I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life ever.  DONNA  That's amazing. JERRY  Thank you. DONNA  Is there anything else about you I should know?  JERRY  Yes, I'm lactose intolerant. DONNA  Really? JERRY  I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. Uhm,   I'll be right back. (Goes to bathroom)  (George enters) GEORGE  Wait till you hear this (sees Donna). Whoa, ah, I'm sorry, I   didn't, I had no idea. (Goes to leave) DONNA  Wait, wait. He's in the bathroom. GEORGE  I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back.  DONNA  You don't have to leave. GEORGE  You sure? DONNA  Yes. GEORGE  OK. DONNA  I'm Donna. GEORGE  Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial!  DONNA  He told you about that. GEORGE  No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about   that commercial, in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial.   No, he, he would never tell me anything like that. He never discusses anything.   He's, he's like a clam. You're not gonna mention this, to him.. (Jerry re-   enters) DONNA  (To Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I'm not hip   because I like that commercial. JERRY  What? (To George) What did, what did you say?  GEORGE  Say? What? Nothing, I.. DONNA  You told him how I like the commercial.  JERRY  Well, so what if I said that? DONNA  Well, so, you didn't have to tell your friends.  JERRY  No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to tell you.  GEORGE  (To Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?  DONNA  I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.  GEORGE  Boy oh boy. JERRY  I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?  DONNA  I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the   commercial. JERRY  Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.   (Kramer enters)  K Hey. JERRY  Oh, Kramer, this is Donna.  k Oh. Cotton Dockers! GEORGE  Hello! Alright, we should be going. Come on .(Grabs Kramer)   k What? Where are we going? GEORGE  Come on! DONNA  Don't bother, I'm leaving. JERRY  Donna, really, you're making too much of this.   K One hundred percent Cotton Dockers, if they're not Dockers, they're just   pants! JERRY  Please, Donna. DONNA  I don't wanna hear it.(Leaves) GEORGE  I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault.  JERRY  Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway.   k What happened there? JERRY  I'll tell you later. GEORGE  You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.  GEORGE  OK, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn't call   back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the  MACHINE AGAIN  \"I know you're there, I don't know what your story is.\"   Yesterday, I'm a volcano - I try one more call, the machine comes on, and fly   like Mussolini from the balcony- \"Where the hell do you get the nerve? You   invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days? I don't   like coffee, I don't have to come up. I'd like to get one more shot at the   coffee just so I could spit it in your face.\" JERRY  You said that? GEORGE  I lost it. JERRY  I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back.  GEORGE  She did. Today. JERRY  What? GEORGE  She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since   Sunday. She didn't know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine   broke, and she's been using her old machine and she doesn't have the beeper for   it. JERRY  So she didn't get the messages. GEORGE  Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to   see me, we're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me as soon as she   gets home. JERRY  But what about the messages?  (George produces cassette tape from pocket) JERRY  Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?  GEORGE  I'll meet her outside the building.  JERRY  But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right   for that machine. GEORGE  Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I   kidding? I can't do this, I can't do this. I don't even know how to work those   stupid machines. JERRY  There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.  GEORGE  You do it for me. JERRY  What? GEORGE  Come on, it'll be so much easier. JERRY  How you gonna get me up there? GEORGE  I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown.  JERRY  And who makes the switch? GEORGE  You do. JERRY  I do. GEORGE  I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy.  JERRY  I can't get involved in this. GEORGE  I think I may be in love with this woman.  JERRY  What if she sees me? GEORGE  Oh, you are such a wuss. JERRY  A wuss? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Did you call me a wuss? GEORGE  Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.  JERRY  I got one problem: you're keeping her busy in the other room. Now,   what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me   that she's coming. GEORGE  A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call out 'Tippy   toe!' JERRY  'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so. GEORGE  You don't like 'Tippy toe?' JERRY  No 'Tippy toe.' GEORGE  Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing.  JERRY  What song? GEORGE  Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'  JERRY  What is that? GEORGE  Oh, it's a lovely song. (Sings) How do you solve a problem like   Maria? JERRY  Anything else? GEORGE  You pick it. JERRY  'Lemon Tree' GEORGE  Peter, Paul and Mary. JERRY  No, Trini Lopez. BOTH  (Singing) Lemon tree very pretty and a lemon flower  GEORGE  You got the tape? JERRY  (Produces tapes) Standard. Micro. GEORGE  How do you feel? Confident? JERRY  Feel good. GEORGE  You nervous? JERRY  Not at all. GEORGE  Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared to   death, just walk away, it's off, cancel everything, go!  (Carol arrives) GEORGE  Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you   when I got home. GEORGE  I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you.  CAROL  Oh, that's so sweet. GEORGE  Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him   around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all   the time. JERRY  All the time. CAROL  It's nice to meet you. JERRY  Hi. CAROL  So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?  GEORGE  You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a   ride home. CAROL  OK. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park?  GEORGE  Don't you wanna go upstairs first?  CAROL  No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman.  JERRY  You know, I really need to use the bathroom.  CAROL  Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.  GEORGE  Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so...  CAROL  Well they have a phone.  (George takes Carol to one side) GEORGE  I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we   really should go upstairs. CAROL  (Aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my   machine. GEORGE  Right, right.  (They enter building) CAROL  The bathroom's on the hall to the right.  JERRY  Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long trip.  CAROL  No, I'm fine. JERRY  Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away.  CAROL  Oh that's weird. GEORGE  No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that in medical   journals. It's a freak thing, but... CAROL  Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go.  GEORGE  Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now.  CAROL  Sure. GEORGE  Please, this is very, very important. (Leads her to other room)   (Jerry goes over to machine to switch tape) GEORGE  (Shouts from other room) Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!   (Carol reappears followed by George) CAROL  (To Jerry) Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've seen   you, it's driving me crazy. JERRY  Right. I am. GEORGE  Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment, if   you wouldn't mind, and then we'll talk to Jerry.  (George leads Carol back out, Jerry switches tapes) JERRY  (Shouts) Hey you two. I'm ready to go.   (George and Carol return) CAROL  That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the   pool? GEORGE  (To Jerry) Don't you find that strange?  JERRY  Yes. CAROL  Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing here,   let's go. Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour   called me and played my messages to me over the phone. GEORGE  Oh, uhhh... CAROL  Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes   like that.  (All three leave)  I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw   somebody on the street I didn't want to talk to I could go \"Excuse me, I'm not   in right now. If you could just leave a message, I could walk away.\" I also   have a cordless phone, but I don't like that as much, because you can't slam   down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone - \"You can't   talk to me like that!\" Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless   phone - \"You can't talk to me like that!\" (Mimes fiddly button-pressing) \"I   told him!\"     THE END>",

        "text": "   THE APARTMENT Written by  Peter Mehlman   (Night club) JERRY  Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around,   and I think, well, it's a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of it. It keeps coming in and coming in. Everytime I   paint it, it's closer and closer. I don't even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to   push his way through from the other side. That's where I plug in.. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what   I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control.. that's why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurling through space in your living room, watching   TV. That's why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had a big screen. They came over Friday night, Klingon boxing.. gotta be   there.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and Elaine are looking at Kramer with their arms folded. His hair is slicked down)  JERRY  What did you do? KRAMER  Mousse. I moussed up. ELAINE  I guess it was just a matter of time.  KRAMER  You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I had two lives. My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth,   have you ever seen a better looking guy? JERRY  Oh, look, its so subjective. ELAINE  I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.  KRAMER  Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that.  ELAINE  She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.  JERRY  Maybe.  (A loud argument erupts in the hallway between Harold and Manny, the building supervisors)  HAROLD  No, I'm not going up there. (Manny screams out something in Spanish)  JERRY  Harold and Manny. HAROLD  I'm not going. (Manny says something in Spanish, Jerry goes out into the hall)  JERRY  Boys, boys. HAROLD  Oh, Jerry. JERRY  I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?  HAROLD  Yeah, yeah.. (Joking) Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? (Manny starts yelling at Harold in Spanish) I was only   joking. (To Jerry) He thinks I'm going to give you Mrs. Hudwalker's things. (Manny starts talking in Spanish) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment.   It's a good thing her rent was overdue. She'd be rotting up there for a month.  JERRY  She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died? HAROLD  Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have a wig on. It was horrifying.  MANNY  Harold, (In Spanish) Come on, hurry up!  HAROLD  (To Manny) What's the matter with you?! I'm talking. So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?  JERRY  Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?  HAROLD  Oh yeah, I like her. She always says \"hello\" to me.  JERRY  It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in a second.  HAROLD  Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. (Manny starts protesting in Spanish) What's the difference? It's true.  JERRY  So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?  HAROLD  Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month. (Manny yells in Spanish) Okay.. (Manny keeps talking in Spanish) Okay.   (Jerry goes back to his apartment, passing Kramer on the way)  KRAMER  (Talking about his hair) Hey, Harold, what do you think?  HAROLD  Manny, look, Kramer put mousse in his hair.  MANNY  (In Spanish) It looks worse. KRAMER  (Not knowing what Manny said) Thanks.   (Jerry enters his apartment) ELAINE  What was that all about? JERRY  Oh, nothing important. ELAINE  What's going on? What is that look?  JERRY  What look? Nothing. ELAINE  Something's going on here. JERRY  I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down.. I can't decide.  ELAINE  Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon. Cough it up.  JERRY  Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts   sometimes - to give, and give, and give.. ELAINE  Would you please? JERRY  What would you say if I told you that..  ELAINE  Told me what?! JERRY  ..I got you an apartment in this building.  ELAINE  (Dumbfounded) No. JERRY  Yes. ELAINE  No. JERRY  Yes. ELAINE  You didn't. JERRY  I did. ELAINE  You got me an apartment in the building?!  JERRY  I got you an apartment in the building.  ELAINE  How did you.. JERRY  Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?  ELAINE  No. JERRY  She died. ELAINE  (Thrilled) She died?! JERRY  She died. ELAINE  She died! JERRY  And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!  ELAINE  Get out! (Pushes Jerry, he stumbles back) Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!  JERRY  Four hundred a month. ELAINE  And I'll be right upstairs? JERRY  Right upstairs. ELAINE  Right above you? JERRY  Right above me. ELAINE  Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time!  JERRY  (Suddenly having second thoughts) All the time..  ELAINE  We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!  JERRY  ..All the time..  (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie.   You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You're out   somewhere with people, \"Gee, you look pregnant.. are ya?\" \"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that's not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let's take   this whole scene again. People, think about what you're saying!\"   (Scene ends)  (Coffee shop) GEORGE  (Pays his bill) Thanks, see ya later, Donna. (Walks out, he runs into Jerry outside the shop) What happened to you?  JERRY  You can't believe what I just did.  GEORGE  What? What did you do? JERRY  I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable.  GEORGE  What did you do? JERRY  How could I have done that? GEORGE  Done what? JERRY  I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in.  GEORGE  Elaine's moving into your building?  JERRY  Yes. Right above me. GEORGE  Right above you? JERRY  Yes. GEORGE  You're gonna be neighbors. JERRY  I know. Neighbors. GEORGE  She's right above you? JERRY  Right above me. GEORGE  How could you do that? JERRY  'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.  GEORGE  Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a bigger idiot than me.  JERRY  Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?  GEORGE  Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?  JERRY  She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.  GEORGE  You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed   advantage. JERRY  But I need the home bed advantage!  GEORGE  Of course, we all do. JERRY  (Gesturing to the coffee shop) Come in for two minutes and sit with me.  GEORGE  I was just in there. It's embarrassing.  JERRY  Oh, who's gonna know? GEORGE  They saw me walk out. JERRY  Two minutes.  (Scene cuts to Jerry and George in the coffee shop) JERRY  My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went   for a cup of coffee, and in that second - ruined my life. GEORGE  My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.  JERRY  ..So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?  GEORGE  Tough. JERRY  You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building.. and she loves a good shower.  GEORGE  I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.  JERRY  If they were fanatic about showers, they might.  GEORGE  For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to..  JERRY  Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?  GEORGE  I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?  JERRY  Yeah, the guy with the flat head? GEORGE  He's a cube.. anyway, he got married six months ago. he told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him   everywhere he goes. JERRY  Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.  GEORGE  (Joking) I wonder if that's really true.  JERRY  That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.   (Scene ends)  (Apartment buliding hallway)  (George is trying on a wedding band) GEORGE  Thanks a lot. I\"ll give it back to you in a week.  KRAMER  You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a piece.  GEORGE  I'm not doing that. KRAMER  Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?  GEORGE  No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.   (Manny and Harold are arguing again from down the hall) HAROLD  I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! I want a big sponge! (Manny yells) You can't pick up anything with these! There's no absorption!   (Manny yells in Spanish, Jerry exits his apartment) JERRY  Boys, boys. HAROLD  Hi, Jerry. HAROLD  Hello, Jerry. (Says something in Spanish to Harold)  HAROLD  Okay.. your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry.  JERRY  What? HAROLD  Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. (Manny yells) Because it's true!   Why shouldn't I tell him? JERRY  Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen. (Manny talks in Spanish)  HAROLD  Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her.  JERRY  Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. (Goes back to his apartment) You know, I used to think that the   universe is a random, chaotic, sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.  GEORGE  What happened to you? JERRY  Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the   apartment upstairs. GEORGE  Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!  JERRY  Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!  GEORGE  So, she can't get the apartment. JERRY  Can't get it. GEORGE  So, she doesn't move in. JERRY  No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan.  GEORGE  And how does the baldness fit into that plan?   (The intercom buzzes) JERRY  (Into the intercom) Elaine? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  (Unlocks the main door. To George) Alright, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed. You're going to really see   me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this.. maybe you should go in the other room.  GEORGE  Are you kidding?! I lie ever second of the day. My whole life is a sham!  JERRY  'Cause you know, I love Elaine. GEORGE  Of course you do. JERRY  But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me..  (To someone in the hallway) No, I'll be seeing you. (Starts to sing) \"Good morning, good morning..\" Have you ever gotten up in the morning   and felt it's great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above? (George leaves, and goes to the other room) Oh, and before I forget, I have the   checks for first month, last month, security deposit. I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.  JERRY  (Looks at the checks) Well.. there's a little bit of a problem.  ELAINE  Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, \"Why stand when   you can sit?\" Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies.. JERRY  No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that   money. ELAINE  Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.  JERRY  I know. ELAINE  How am I going to get five thousand dollars?  JERRY  I have no idea.  (Enter Kramer) KRAMER  Hey, my new neighbor! ELAINE  I'm not moving in. KRAMER  What? ELAINE  They want five thousand dollars now.  KRAMER  So, okay. What's the problem? ELAINE  I don't have five thousand dollars.  KRAMER  C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.. Jerry, you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.  JERRY  Yeah, well, I didn't.. Is that something you want to borrow?  ELAINE  No, that's too much money to borrow.  KRAMER  Loan her the money. You can afford it.  JERRY  She doesn't want to borrow the money.  KRAMER  Oh, c'mon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between friends?  ELAINE  Of course I'd pay you back.. KRAMER  Yeah, so what's the problem? JERRY  Who said there's a problem? KRAMER  He said he'd loan you the money. ELAINE  Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?  KRAMER  That's okay. He doesn't care. ELAINE  You know, money can sometimes come between friends.  KRAMER  Get outta here. ELAINE  Let me think about it. KRAMER  What's to think about? ELAINE  I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just take one more look at it. (Leaves)  JERRY  It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand.. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye.   She's gone. Then you come in, \"Why don't you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You've got five thousand. Give her five thousand.\"  KRAMER  You didn't want her in the building?  JERRY  No, I didn't! KRAMER  Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she was going to think about it.  JERRY  People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from the animals.  KRAMER  I still don't understand what the problem is having her in the building.  JERRY  Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal. You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I   sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn't understand.  KRAMER  Because I'm a pod?  (George returns for Jerry's bedroom just as Elaine returns)  ELAINE  I'll take it!  (George turns on his heels, and goes back into Jerry's room)   (Scene ends)  (Roxanne's apartment)  (Guests are milling around, eating. Elaine enters with Jerry and George. Roxanne greets them)  ROXANNE  Hi, Elaine.. ELAINE  Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry. (They exchange greetings) Jerry's the one who got me my new   apartment! ROXANNE  So, you're Elaine's hero. JERRY  Yeah, it's my life's work. ROXANNE  There are so few true heros left in this world. (Jerry's attracted to Roxanne, Elaine notices)  GEORGE  (Showing off his wedding band) Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what going on with her. Don't   let any one kid you, it's tough. (Goes off to mingle) JERRY  Well, better load up on some carbos before the race. (Starts selecting food from the tables)  ROXANNE  Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?  JERRY  Oh, yes. Particularily if your not in it.  ROXANNE  I wish we had a view of the finish line.  JERRY  What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.   (Roxanne makes a face, Scene guts to George. He's standing next to an attractive woman)  GEORGE  ..Yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I'm tellin' ya, it's one thing after another.  RITA  Is she here? GEORGE  No, she's working. RITA  What does she do? GEORGE  She's an.. entymologist - you know, bees, flies, gnats. What about you?  RITA  I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It's great! I can get free tickets to any sporting even in New York. (George is stunned) Anyway, she's a   very luck woman. GEORGE  But.. (She leaves, George is standing there)   (Scene cuts to an entering man and woman) ROXANNE  Hi Stan. Joanne. ELAINE  Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They're in my short story class with Roxanne and me. Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!  JOANNE  Well, Jerry, it'll be nice having a close friend nearby?  JERRY  Fantastic.. STAN  She can pop in whenever she wants.  JERRY  I know. JOANNE  She doesn't even need to knock! JERRY  It's tremendous. STAN  Anytime of day. JERRY  I'm in heaven. ELAINE  Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He's the one who got me the apartment.  RITA  Oh, Hi. (Calling to someone) bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.   (Scene cuts to George) GEORGE  I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, wha't so hard? (The both laugh flirtingly)  SUSIE  So, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attrack women.  GEORGE  You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.  SUSIE  That's too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses. (Shrugs, smiles, then leaves George)  RITA  Hey everybody! Here come the runners!   (Everyone runs to the windows. Jerry and Elaine stay put) ELAINE  So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?  JERRY  Oh, I wouldn't quite say that. ELAINE  Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.  JERRY  I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.  ELAINE  Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?  JERRY  Na.. ELAINE  Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But - as long as   you're okay with it, it's fine with me.  (Scene cuts to George) JANICE  I've never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It's a shame   you're married.. GEORGE  (Frantically tries to take the ring off) I'm not. It's just a sociological experiment!  JANICE  Please.. (Walks away)  (Jerry walks over to George) JERRY  You have no idea what an idiot it. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn't take it. (Points to himself) This is an idiot.  GEORGE  Is that right? (Showing him up) I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please,   a little respect. For I am Costanza. Lord of the Idiots! ROXANNE  (Yelling out the window) You're all winners!  GEORGE  But suddenly, a new contender has emerged..   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  (Into the phone) George, I didn't sleep at all last night.. I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you   listening to me? Just put some soap on your finger.. it'll slide right off.. Then try axle grease. (Kramer enters) I'll call you back after I talk to her. Bye.  KRAMER  Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool.  JERRY  What? What's cool? KRAMER  Elaine. JERRY  What are you talking about? KRAMER  I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.  JERRY  You what?! Get out! Ten thousand? KRAMER  (Nods) Cash. JERRY  Who would pay that much? KRAMER  He's in the music business. JERRY  Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I'm in the clear   here. Elaine's not moving in! I don't have to confront her! She has no idea I never wanted her to move in.. I\"m golden!  KRAMER  Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Harold and Manny are in Jerry's apartment. A pulsing music is coming through the walls)  ELAINE  Wow. You're right. That is loud. JERRY  It's just unbelievable. ELAINE  They rehearse all the time? JERRY  All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown! (To Harold)   Can't you do something? HAROLD  I'm not going up. It stinks up there.  JERRY  Manny.. MANNY  (In Spanish) They're allowed to play until eleven o' clock.  HAROLD  I'm not the one who said eleven o' clock. He makes up his own rules.  ELAINE  Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  (Talking about the music) Oh, I love the one they do right after this one!   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o' clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone's door  and tell them to keep it down? You're really altering your whole self-image, I mean, what am I? Fred Mertz now? What's happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a  shusher? I used to be a shushee. There's a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh..shh.... shhh... shhh.. Doesn't work, 'cause  nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a Shh. \"Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me.\" Some people you can't shush in a movie  theater. There's always that certain group of people, isn't it. They're talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won't shush. They're the unshushables.

        "text": "  THE STATUE Written by  Larry Charles   (Night club) JERRY  I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, \"You may have already won.\" I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, \"You have definitely lost!\" You turn it over, giant printing, \"Not even close!\" You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, \"Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest.\"   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (George is reading the paper. Kramer and Jerry both try to enter carrying a large carton with the name Seinfeld on it)  JERRY  (Trying to get the box through the door. To Kramer) To the right. (They get it through)  GEORGE  That took awhile. JERRY  (Sarcastic) Don't get up. GEORGE  I'd like to help, but my neck..  (The set the box on the table) GEORGE  So how long has it been in the basement?  JERRY  Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it. (To Kramer) Alright, so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here.   (They open the box, and start going through it) GEORGE  What's in it? JERRY  Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.  KRAMER  (Pulls out some socks) You want these? Knee socks. You don't wear knee socks.  JERRY  No, go ahead. (Looks around his apartment) Look at this place. I can't wait to get it cleaned.  GEORGE  I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.  JERRY  No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it.  GEORGE  Students can't clean. It's anathema. (Jerry's confused) ..They don't like it.  JERRY  How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?   (Kramer pulls a statue out of the box) KRAMER  Now this, I like.  (George's eyes light up when he sees the statue) GEORGE  Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this.  KRAMER  (Getting possesive) Wait, wait, wait..  GEORGE  Let me just see it. KRAMER  Come on..  (The both grab it) GEORGE  Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the same!  JERRY  What? GEORGE  When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, \"MacArthur Park\", and I got to the part about, \"I'll never have that recipe again,\" and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.   (George grips the statue, but Kramer wont let go. They start to fight for it)  KRAMER  C'mon, George. I saw it first. GEORGE  No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.  KRAMER  No, I got dibs! GEORGE  What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!  JERRY  (Stepping in) Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't you just settle it like mature adults?  KRAMER  Potato man! GEORGE  No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink.   (Kramer and George both visibly add up in their heads to see who would lose if Inka-Dink was the way to go)  KRAMER  Okay.. start with me. GEORGE  Yeah, good, good.  (Jerry begins the childish choosing game of Inka-dink, pointing alternately between Kramer and George with every syllable)  JERRY  Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine.. (He lands on Kramer, then completes the rhyme) And you are it! (Lands on George)  KRAMER  What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it.  GEORGE  No, no, no, no.. I'm \"it\". I win. JERRY  No, he's it. He wins. \"It\" is good.  KRAMER  Do over - start with him. JERRY  No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.   (Kramer tosses the statue to George) KRAMER  Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.  JERRY  Alright, c'mon. Let's go. KRAMER  Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. (Hums out the theme song)  GEORGE  (In shock) I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.  JERRY  Come on, let's go. (They go to the door. George sets the statue down) Aren't you gonna take it?  GEORGE  No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick it up later.  GOERGE  (To Kramer) What about your stuff?  KRAMER  Oh, uh, well - okay. (Balls up the clothes he just got, and throws them into his apartment, and leaves)  JERRY  Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.  GEORGE  What? JERRY  The Inka-dink.. you were \"It\". GEORGE  \"It\"'s bad? JERRY  \"It\" very bad.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment) RAVA  Well, if they don't let you be my editor on this book, I'll go to another publisher. It's that simple.  ELAINE  You told them that? RAVA  Of course. ELAINE  This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.   (Jerry enters for the bedroom carrying luggage) JERRY  (Frantic) So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much longer. I've got a flight.  ELAINE  Oh, probably caught in traffic. RAVA  (Serious) Or maybe he's dead. JERRY  (Joking) So what do you write, children's books?   (There's a knock at the door) RAVA  That's Ray.  (Ray enters with cleaning gear) RAY  Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you. (Bows)  JERRY  (Taken aback) ..Alright. RAVA  And we have to get back to work. (She exits with Elaine)  JERRY  (Rushed) I gotta get to the airport.  RAY  Your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.  JERRY  The toilet brush is under the sink.. (Exits)   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, \"I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there.\" And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, \"Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?\"   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid. (Opens refrigerator) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this. (Gets on his knees) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!  ELAINE  There's no Rubber Man. JERRY  ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man and Plastic Man.  ELAINE  I'm leaving. JERRY  Where are you going? ELAINE  To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.  JERRY  Wait. I'll go with you. (They both go tward the door. Jerry opens it) Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! (The leave)   (Scene ends)  (Rava's apartment)  (Jerry, Elaine, and Rava sit in the living room) ELAINE  (To Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request..  RAVA  Demand. (The sound of locks being unlocked can be heard) There's Ray.. late as usual.   (Ray enters) RAY  Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and future king of comedy, \"Jerry the First,\" gracing our humble abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty.  JERRY  Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.  RAY  But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.  JERRY  (Joking about his personality) Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?   (They all laugh - Ray laughs longer than everyone else. Jerry savors the laughs of his big fan - then he sees George's statue on the mantle of the fireplace. He's stunned by the sight)  RAVA  The water is boiling. Are you having tea?  ELAINE AND RAY  Yes.  (Jerry's still stunned) ELAINE  Jerry? ..Jerry! JERRY  (Snaps out of it) What? RAVA  (From the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?  RAY  Yeah, I'm coming!  (He leaves. As soon as both Rava and Ray are in the kitchen, Jerry and Elaine start talking in loud whispers)  JERRY  (Points to the statue) I think that's the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!  ELAINE  What statue? JERRY  I had a statue! ELAINE  You have a statue? I never saw a statue.  JERRY  My grandfather gave me a statue! ELAINE  Since when? JERRY  What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!   (Ray pops his head back into the living room) RAY  Do you take sugar? JERRY AND ELAINE  Uhh.. no.  (Ray goes back into the kitchen) JERRY  I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!  ELAINE  Do you realize what you're saying?  JERRY  Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!   (Ray pops in again) RAY  Lemon? JERRY AND ELAINE  (Causual) Uh.. sure, yeah..  (Ray goes back into the kitchen) ELAINE  Are you sure? JERRY  Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.  ELAINE  Ninety-nine percent sure?!  (Ray and Rava both enter, carrying a tray of tea) RAY  Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the soul.   (Jerry smells it suspiciously - like it's poisoned. A ding from the kitchen can be heard)  RAY  The pastries!  (Ray and Rava exit in different directions) ELAINE  Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.  JERRY  Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment.  ELAINE  I never saw the statue. JERRY  I had a statue! What should I do? ELAINE  I don't know. JERRY  ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. (Grabs the phone, and dials)  ELAINE  Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me. JERRY  Don't worry.. (Whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!.. It's Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!.. (Rava enters with a manuscript. Jerry starts talking casually)  JERRY  Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) My mother.. She forgot how to make French Toast. You know how mothers are.  RAVA  My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere.   (A long beat passes) JERRY  My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?   (Ray enters with a tray of pastries) RAY  I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.  JERRY  ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial.  ELAINE  (Takes the manuscript) Oh, see you tomarrow morning.   (They go to leave) RAY  Oh, how about dinner? JERRY  No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. (They leave)   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  (On the phone) Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. (Hangs up) Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they can do.  KRAMER  Let's go get him. JERRY  Yeah, right. GEORGE  We can't just let him get away with this.  JERRY  Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy.  KRAMER  You wanta go get him? ELAINE  Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it.  GEORGE  Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!  ELAINE  George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?  GEORGE  Who is this Rava? KRAMER  I say we get him. ELAINE  No! GEORGE  Let me just call him. JERRY  I'll call him. (Picks up the cordless phone. Kramer, George, and Elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on the conversation. As Jerry's talking, the three others still fight) Hello, Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (To Kramer and George) Will you shut up?! (To Ray) Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. (Hangs up)  ELAINE  (Scrambling) Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it.  GEORGE  Oh, he stole it? ELAINE  C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?  JERRY AND GEORGE  No.  (Scene ends)  (Coffee shop)  (Jerry sits alone. In the next booth to Jerry's back, George is sitting inconspicuously)  GEORGE  (To Jerry, without looking at him) I thought you said one o' clock.  JERRY  Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his \"M.O.\"  GEORGE  Remember, don't take any crap. JERRY  Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it.  GEORGE  I'll be right here.  (Ray enters) JERRY  (Sarcastic) That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. (Greeting him) Ray?  RAY  (Stands next to the table) Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into?  JERRY  ..Well, I didn't.. RAY  Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.  GEORGE  (Muttering to himself) I wonder why.  JERRY  Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything.  RAY  Give it back? JERRY  Yeah. RAY  What are you talking about? JERRY  What are you talking about? GEORGE  (Muttering) What is he talking about..  RAY  I'm talking about the statue. JERRY  Yeah, me too. RAY  Give it back to whom? JERRY  Me. GEORGE  (To himself) Yeah, him. RAY  You? JERRY  Yeah. Me. RAY  I'm not getting this. GEORGE  (To himself) You already got it. JERRY  Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then I saw it in your house.  RAY  What are you saying? JERRY  What am I saying? GEORGE  (To himself) Take a wild guess. RAY  Are you saying I stole your statue?  GEORGE  (To himself) What a mind. JERRY  Well, I.. RAY  I can't believe what I'm hearing. JERRY  I can't believe what I'm hearing. GEORGE  (to himself) I can't believe what I'm hearing.  RAY  For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop.  GEORGE  (To Himself) A pawn shop? JERRY  A pawn shop? RAY  Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.  GEORGE  (To himself) And cleaning them out.   (Jerry elbows George - a message to shut up) JERRY  Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.  RAY  What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?  GEORGE  (To himself) Again with the Rava. RAY  You want her. JERRY  (Joking) No, she's a little too cheery for me.  RAY  (Losing it) She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!  JERRY  I know Finland. They're neutral. RAY  Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?  JERRY  No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times.  GEORGE  (Mocking) \"Oh, I find you so charming\" ..You wuss.  JERRY  (To George) Did you call me a wuss?  RAY  What did you say? JERRY  I said luss.. I'm at a luss.. RAY  I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.  JERRY  That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table in anger) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.  RAY  And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.  GEORGE  (Muttering to himself) Singapore?! Do you hear this?  RAY  If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.  GEORGGE  That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! (Gets up, turns around, and confronts Ray) You stole the statue! You're a theif! You're a liar!  JERRY  (Pleading) George. RAY  (To Jerry) Who is this? GEORGE  I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!  RAY  What's going on here? GEORGE  GUILTY! RAY  Your friend is crazy. GEORGE  Oh, I'm crazy! JERRY  (Still pleading) George, george.. RAY  I've got to get going. I have a class.  GEORGE  Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!  RAY  Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.  GEORGE  You mean alias. RAY  You are starting to make me angry.  GEORGE  Well, that was bound to happen! RAY  (To Jerry) I hope you think about what you've done here today.. and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. (Goes to leave)  JERRY  Hey, Ray. RAY  (Stops) Yes? JERRY  How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!   (Scene ends)  (Pendant publishing)  (Elaine and Rava are waiting for an elevator) ELAINE  Nervous? RAVA  Why should I be? ELAINE  Yeah. Right. RAVA  Your notes are very insightful. ELAINE  The book is great. Did you go out last night?  RAVA  No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.  ELAINE  They all are.. RAVA  Was Jerry? ELAINE  I can't remember..  (Doors open. They step in) RAVA  You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.  ELAINE  Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.   (The doors close. Scene cuts to moments later, on another floor. The doors open)  RAVA  (Annoyed) So you think he stole it?!  ELAINE  Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence.  RAVA  I admit nothing!  (The doors close. Scene cuts to the inside of the elevator)  MAN  Will you put that cigarette out, please?   (Rava ignores him) ELAINE  Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and it's in your apartment.  RAVA  Maybe you think we're in cahoots. ELAINE  No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence.  RAVA  Yes, that's all, a coincidence! ELAINE  A big coincidence. RAVA  Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!  ELAINE  No, that's a big coincidence. RAVA  That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!  ELAINE  No, there are degrees of coincidences.  RAVA  No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! (Enraged, she asks everone in the elevator) Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? (Silent) ..Well?! Well?!..   (Everyone just kinda shrugs, then murmurs. The doors open) MAN  Will you put that cigarette out?! RAVA  (Pointing the lit end at him) Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us.  ELAINE  Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?   (The doors close. Scene cuts to another floor. The elevator is empty except for Elaine. There's a janitor's cart parked right outside the doors. She steps out, then throws the manuscript into the garbage can of the cart, and exits)   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  (On the phone) Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. (Hangs up) She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me.  KRAMER  I'm not happy about this. ELAINE  Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?  GEORGE  There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.  JERRY  Really? GEORGE  (Casually) Sure. Why not? ELAINE  Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.  JERRY  Can't you talk to your boss? ELAINE  I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think you're funny at all.  KRAMER  I'm not happy about this. JERRY  Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..  GEORGE  Yeah.. He'll have my parents!  (Scene ends)  (Rava and Ray's apartment)  (Ray's home alone. There's a knock at the door) KRAMER  Police! Open up! RAY  Police? (Opens the door a crack - Kramer barges in like a cop. He's wearing Jerry's grandfather's suit and hat. He forces Ray against the wall - face first)  KRAMER  Freeze, mother! RAY  Hey..  (Kramer shoves him roughly against the wall) KRAMER  Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! (Looks around) You're in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. and uh, uh.. murder.  RAY  Murder?!  (Kramer shoves him against the wall) KRAMER  Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!  RAY  I think you have me confused with somebody else.  KRAMER  (Afraid he's got the wrong guy) Is your name Ray?  RAY  Yeah. KRAMER  (Assured) Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. (Grabs the statue from the mantle, and puts it in his bag)  RAY  Hey, hey, are you a cop? KRAMER  Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?  RAY  Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.  KRAMER  Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. (Exits)   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Kramer guides Jerry, Elaine, and George into the apartment)  JERRY  Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?   (Kramer runs to his apartment, then returns with a duffel bag. He places it on the table, and reveals the statue)  GEORGE  Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!  KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  Kramer, what did you do? KRAMER  Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.  GEORGE  I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. (Giddily) I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!  KRAMER  Well, I'll think of something.. (Slaps George on the back - sending the statue crashing to the ground)   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things - things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on. THE END>",

This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone.   Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you.   (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You   are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at   you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking   object over on desk) I quit! KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last   night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the   roof to kill himself. JERRY  Well, what'd you say? KRAMER  I said \" Jump.\" Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I   said \" Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop   bothering me.\" At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.  JERRY  What's his problem? KRAMER  No job. No women. JERRY  He called the right guy. KRAMER  What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live   for? Why should I lie to him? JERRY  All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.  KRAMER  Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?  JERRY  Fluff and fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with   words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight. KRAMER  How 'bout if I put a few things --  JERRY  Wait a sec. I don't wanna do -- KRAMER  Well, you're going over there. JERRY  I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You   can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a   riot. KRAMER  Have you ever met my guys? JERRY  No. I can't say as I have. KRAMER  Well! JERRY  All right. Put 'em on top. KRAMER  Ah! JERRY  Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I get it done   in a separate machine? VIC  I'll have to charge you for another machine.  JERRY  Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are   not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump   across. GEORGE  Guess what. JERRY  How did you know I was here? GEORGE  Kramer. Guess what. JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  I quit my job. JERRY  Get outta here. GEORGE  I couldn't take it anymore. VIC  You can have this on Monday. JERRY  What happened? Levitan? GEORGE  I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I   get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall.   Well, (laughing) we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!  JERRY  You and your toilets. GEORGE  I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs)  JERRY  So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else   in real estate? GEORGE  Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.  JERRY  So what are you gonna do? GEORGE  I like sports. I could do something in sports.  JERRY  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity? GEORGE  You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.  JERRY  Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.  GEORGE  Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could   be like, an announcer. Like a caller man. You know how I always make   those interesting comments during the game. JERRY  Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.  GEORGE  What about that? JERRY  Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that   are, you know, in broadcasting. GEORGE  Well, that's really not fair. JERRY  I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?  GEORGE  Movies. I like to watch movies. JERRY  Yeah. Yeah. GEORGE  Do they pay people to watch movies?  JERRY  Projectionists. GEORGE  That's true. JERRY  But you gotta know how to work the projector.  GEORGE  Right. JERRY  And it's probably a union thing. GEORGE  (scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a   talk show host? JERRY  Talk show host. That's good. GEORGE  I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone   even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.  JERRY  Really? GEORGE  Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you   start? JERRY  Well, that's where it gets tricky.  GEORGE  You can't just walk into a building and say \" I wanna be a talk   show host.\" JERRY  I wouldn't think so. GEORGE  It's all politics. JERRY  All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?  GEORGE  This could have been a huge mistake.  JERRY  Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.  GEORGE  (sighs) What should I do? JERRY  Maybe you can just go back. GEORGE  Go back? JERRY  Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.  GEORGE  You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it   never happened? JERRY  Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.  GEORGE  Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.  JERRY  Never happened. GEORGE  I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?  JERRY  So what? You're entitled. GEORGE  I'm emotional. JERRY  That's right. You're emotional. GEORGE  Never happened. JERRY  Never happened. GEORGE  How ya doin'? GLENDA  What are you doing here? GEORGE  What? I work here. GLENDA  I thought you quit. GEORGE  What quit? (laughing) Who quit? DAN  Bill, how was your weekend? BILL  Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?  DAN  Fine weekend. GEORGE  Yeah. Good weekend. DAN  Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. (laughing) Lisa was a   little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor   someday. GEORGE  Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor. LEVITAN  Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?  AVA  I got a little tied up. LEVITAN  I'll bet you did.  (laughter breaks out in boardroom) LEVITAN  I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick   Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in   Lasky's Bar, Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really   means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing   here? GEORGE  What? LEVITAN  Am I crazy, or didn't you quit? GEORGE  When? LEVITAN  Friday. GEORGE  Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You   took that seriously? LEVITAN  You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?  GEORGE  Come on. Will you stop it. LEVITAN  No brains? No ability? GEORGE  Teasing. LEVITAN  Okay. I want you outta here. GEORGE  I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious   aren't you? Oh, (laughing) you see? LEVITAN  You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're   there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll   always be a loser. GEORGE  \" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.\" This is   what he said to me. JERRY  Well, so that's that. GEORGE  No. That's not that. JERRY  That's not that? GEORGE  No. JERRY  Well, if that's not that, what is that?  GEORGE  I've got some plans. I got plans. JERRY  What kind of plans? GEORGE  What's the difference? JERRY  You don't wanna tell me? GEORGE  I'm gonna slip him a mickey. JERRY  What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you Peter   Lorre? GEORGE  You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been   looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole   thing. JERRY  What if you destroy him? GEORGE  No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched   it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over. JERRY  Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.  GEORGE  This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing!   It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey! JERRY  You've really gone mental. GEORGE  Nah. JERRY  Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying   \"mickey\"! GEORGE  I got a sauce. JERRY  You got a mickey sauce? GEORGE  And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.  JERRY  Elaine? How did you rope her into this?  GEORGE  I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.  JERRY  She knew that. GEORGE  But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.  JERRY  What is the point of all this? GEORGE  Revenge. JERRY  Oh, the best revenge is living well.  GEORGE  There's no chance of that. JERRY  Did you get your laundry? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  What's with you? KRAMER  He jumped. JERRY  What? KRAMER  Yeah. Newman jumped. JERRY  Did he call you last night? KRAMER  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  JERRY  What did you say? KRAMER  I said \" Wave to me when you pass my window.\"  JERRY  Whew. Did he wave? KRAMER  No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from   across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to   get back at me. JERRY  Oh, my god! KRAMER  What's the matter? JERRY  Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some   reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely   forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on,   let's go. KRAMER  Where? Where? JERRY  To the Laundromat. VIC  I never saw it. KRAMER  Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?  VIC  Hey, you see that sign right there?  JERRY  Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want?  VIC  I'm not responsible. JERRY  So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a   license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry? VIC  You ever hear of a bank? JERRY  Come on. Let's go. KRAMER  No. You can't let him get away with this.  ELAINE  Which one is he? GEORGE  That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.  ELAINE  Oh, yeah. I see him. GEORGE  Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this. ELAINE  Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?  GEORGE  This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.  ELAINE  Yeah. It is kind of cool. GEORGE  First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.  ELAINE  I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do   in the movies. GEORGE  That's exactly what I told Jerry! ELAINE  Really? GEORGE  Yes!  (both laughing) GEORGE  God, I've never felt so alive! JERRY  Maybe we should call this off. KRAMER  Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in   the washing machine. JERRY  And what's gonna happen? KRAMER  Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the   cycle it'll be a solid block! JERRY  If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like   Lex Luthor. KRAMER  You keep him busy.  (Kramer, holding heavy bag of concrete in arms, stumbles to machine,   knocking chairs around)  (Kramer plops concrete down onto washing machine) KRAMER  Whoa!  (lifting bag into the air, Kramer, thrown off balance, stumbles backwards   and slams into dryer) GEORGE  You go over there - ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're   keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink. ELAINE  Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?  LEVITAN  Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.  ELAINE  Oops! 'Scuse me. LEVITAN  Yeah. GREENY  I'm gonna get some food. You want some?  LEVITAN  Nah. ELAINE  Hi. LEVITAN  Hi. ELAINE  (sneezes) LEVITAN  God bless you. ELAINE  Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean   that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No   sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank...   yoooou! LEVITAN  You're welcome. ELAINE  People don't say \" God bless you \" as much as they used to. Have   you noticed that? LEVITAN  No. ELAINE  So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.  LEVITAN  Nudist colony? ELAINE  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!  LEVITAN  (laughing) I'd never been to a nudist colony.  ELAINE  Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of   course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this   clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my   office and I'll just sit there naked. LEVITAN  Seriously? ELAINE  Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.  GEORGE  (whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?  GLENDA  What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.  GEORGE  (whispering) I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.  GLENDA  What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.  GEORGE  (whispering) Okay. Okay. Fine. ELAINE  I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked.   Naked. Naked. LEVITAN  Who are you? ELAINE  Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.   (lid on machine slams shut after Kramer opens it, forcing him to pour   concrete all over machine) JERRY  What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?   (opening lid, Kramer begins to contort &amp; flail arms about as a cloud of   concrete covers his face) JERRY  Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle   cycle?  (Kramer emptying bag into machine) JERRY  What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of   temperament?  (finished with machine, Kramer walks to corner of room with half-full bag &amp;   drops it on the floor)  (Kramer giving \"OK\" sign)  (Kramer starting machine &amp; trying to brush the mounds of concrete off of   the machine) JERRY  What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must   be something.  What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?  (Kramer walks over to where Jerry is standing, his entire body covered with   dry concrete) KRAMER  I didn't realize it was a full box.  GEORGE  I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig   is coming off. GLENDA  I don't' wear a wig. GEORGE  One... ELAINE  No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I   really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.  (Levitan &amp; Elaine laughing) ELAINE  I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever   he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a   secret about my bra.  (George empties contents of tiny bottle into Levitan's drink)   (Elaine &amp; Levitan laughing) GEORGE  Hello, Rick. LEVITAN  Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here! GEORGE  That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me! LEVITAN  You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man.  GEORGE  Oh! LEVITAN  I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.  GEORGE  Boom!  (all laughing) LEVITAN  You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad   you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh?  GEORGE  Oh. LEVITAN  Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of   business? I, uh, I want  you to come back. You can use my bathroom anytime you want.  GEORGE  You want me to come back? Uh... LEVITAN  Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!  GEORGE  Rick. LEVITAN  Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr   Properties. GEORGE  Uh, Rick.. LEVITAN  And all the people in this room, (clears throat) that made that   possible.. GEORGE  Rick. LEVITAN  I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little   shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a   very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But,   hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the   office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this? GEORGE  Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor,   or something. ELAINE  Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I   think you need a degree. JERRY  Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you   find it? KRAMER  It was in my laundry. JERRY  In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys.   What did we figure the damage on that machine would be? KRAMER  It was about 1200 bucks. NEWMAN  Kramer! KRAMER  Oh! That's Newman. NEWMAN  I'm on the roof! KRAMER  Well, what are you waiting for? JERRY  Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta   pay this guy the money.. GEORGE  I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.  KRAMER  You wanna shoot some pool tonight?  NEWMAN  I can't. I'm goin' to the movies. GEORGE  Nah. It's probably a union thing.   THE END>",

        "text": "  THE HEART ATTACK Written by   Larry Charles   (Night club) JERRY  You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have   a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call   my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. \"Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies.\" So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we   understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin   them whenever I want!  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's sitting on his couch in the dark, watching TV) TV VOICE  (Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like   flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..   (Jerry's now asleep)  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's bedroom)  (Jerry's laying in his bed. He wakes suddenly, picks up a pen and scribbles something down on a pad. He laughs, shakes his head, then goes back to sleep, laughing   to himself)  (Scene ends)  (Coffee shop)  (Jerry looks tired. He's staring at a crumpled piece of note paper. George takes out a cucumber from a bag in his pocket)  ELAINE  What do you got, a cucumber? GEORGE  Yeah, so what? ELAINE  You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?  GEORGE  They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.  JERRY  (Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.   (Tries to focus on the paper) Wait a second, wait a second.. \"Fax me some halibut.\" Is that funny? Is that a joke?  ELAINE  No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny.\"  JERRY  Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?  ELAINE  (Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?  GEORGE  Let me see that. (Studies the note)  ELAINE  Hey, where's Kramer? JERRY  I don't know. That's like asking \"Where's Waldo?\"  GEORGE  (Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.  JERRY  I don't think that's it. GEORGE  I'm not kidding. JERRY  What does that mean? ELAINE  I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.  JERRY  Oh, he's having a heart attack. GEORGE  Tightness.. JERRY  C'mon. GEORGE  Shortness of breath.. JERRY  Oh, this is ridiculous. GEORGE  Radiating waves of pain.. JERRY  I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure   and not watch it. GEORGE  There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.  JERRY  (To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.  GEORGE  Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.  JERRY  So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?  GEORGE  Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.  JERRY  I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)  (A waitress approaches. George is dying, but the waitress doesn't seem to notice)  WAITRESS  Is everything alright? GEORGE  We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake   on the.. ELAINE  George!  (Scene ends)  (Hospital room)  (George lies in the bed. He has EKG cups on his chest, a tube up his nose, and an IV in his arm. The man in the neighboring bed seems to be in pain)  MAN  Ooohhh... Argghhh.. GEORGE  Are.. are you okay? MAN  Ooooooohhh.. GEORGE  I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any   ice cream. I always felt that- MAN  Shut up!  (Scene goes to Jerry. He's standing at the doorway, showing the note to a nurse)  JERRY  Well? What do you think? NURSE 1  \"Salami, salami, bologna.\" Definitely.  JERRY  \"Salami salami bologna\"? DOCTOR  (In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.  JERRY  (Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how   ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?  GEORGE  No, no thanks. JERRY  (Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?  GEORGE  Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.  JERRY  Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..  GEORGE  Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.  JERRY  No, I tried it on. It fits good. GEORGE  Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..  JERRY  Well, you know.. GEORGE  (Reluctantly) Well, okay. JERRY  Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?  GEORGE  Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..  JERRY  Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.  GEORGE  I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?  JERRY  You know, if your future was a little more certain..  GEORGE  Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's   end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.  JERRY  Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually   do it) GEORGE  What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!   (Elaine enters - she gets a clear shot of Jerry's jokingly trying to kill George)  ELAINE  Jerry! JERRY  (Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)  GEORGE  (To Jerry) Jerk off.  (Jerry goes over to Elaine) JERRY  (Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.   (They both go to George's bed. Elaine decides to go along with Jerry's joke)  ELAINE  Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?   (Jerry and Elaine both sit down, and have their own conversation. They completely ignore George)  GEORGE  I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my   anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!   (The doctor enters. Elaine and the doctor exchange an awkward, romantic glance)  DOCTOR  (To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?  GEORGE  (Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.  DOCTOR  Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.  GEORGE  (Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!  DOCTOR  And you simply haven't had a heart attack.  GEORGE  (Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.  JERRY  (Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?  DOCTOR  No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.  GEORGE  Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.  DOCTOR  Well, I wouldn't go that far. GEORGE  (Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!  DOCTOR  Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?  GEORGE  My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.  DOCTOR  Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.  GEORGE  Really? ELAINE  (Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)  DOCTOR  It happens. JERRY  Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.  ELAINE  I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.  DOCTOR  That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.  JERRY  (Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.  GEORGE  (Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!  DOCTOR  Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.  GEORGE  What? You mean with a knife? DOCTOR  Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice   cream. GEORGE  (Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.  DOCTOR  Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.  ELAINE  (Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)  JERRY  Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.   (Kramer enters, eating off a tray of hospital food) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how   did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.  JERRY  (Trying to shut him up) Kramer. KRAMER  The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next   thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.  JERRY  Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.  KRAMER  No? That's good. GEORGE  I have to have my tonsils taken out.  KRAMER  Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.  JERRY  (Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.  KRAMER  Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a   window going, \"My name is Bob\" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..  GEORGE  Well, what should I do, Kramer? JERRY  Well, for one think, don't listen to him.  KRAMER  I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just   gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.  JERRY  Eckman? I thought he was doing time?  KRAMER  No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.  JERRY  A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.  KRAMER  He's holistic, George. He's holistic.  GEORGE  Holistic.. that sounds right. JERRY  George, you need a medical doctor.  GEORGE  (To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?  JERRY  Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.  GEORGE  Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?  KRAMER  First visit? Thirty-eight bucks. GEORGE  Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.   (Scene ends)  (Healer's apartment)  (Jerry and George are sitting on huge pillows on the apartment floor. Kramers fiddling with an acupuncture model)  GEORGE  So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?  JERRY  Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.  GEORGE  All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm   already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes   in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.  JERRY  (Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.  GEORGE  Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?   (Tor enters. He hugs Kramer for a long time, then walks over to Jerry and George)  TOR  (To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please?  JERRY  Sorry.  (Tor sits down, and turns tward George) TOR  What month were you born? GEORGE  April. TOR  You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.  GEORGE  Really? TOR  Do you use hot water in the shower?  GEORGE  Yes. TOR  Stop using it. GEORGE  ..Okay. KRAMER  I'm off hot water. TOR  Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.  GEORGE  Yes, yes I am. TOR  (Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs   customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.  GEORGE  (Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?  TOR  No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain   sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.  JERRY  (He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.  GEORGE  (Still on the hot water) What about shaving?  TOR  (To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)  GEORGE  I guess so. TOR  (Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion   of heat and wind. JERRY  (Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..  TOR  You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.  GEORGE  (Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?  JERRY  Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?   (Scene ends)  (Doctor's car)  (The Doctor and Elaine are almost done with their date. the doctor is speaking seductively to Elaine while holding out her tongue)  DOCTOR  ..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's   covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..   (The Doctor is still holding her tongue) ELAINE  Uh-huh.  (Scene ends)  (Healer's apartment) TOR  (Pouring tea) Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark.  JERRY  I love crampbark. TOR  Cleavers. JERRY  Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.  TOR  And some couchgrass. JERRY  Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.   (Tor hands George the tea. George isn't willing to drink it right away. Jerry looks skeptical, Kramer, on the other hand, is enthusiastic)  KRAMER  Go ahead, drink it, George. JERRY  Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read.   I was wondering if- TOR  (Takes the note, then laughs when he reads it) Oh, yes.. yes.. \"Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109.. (Hands note back to Jerry)  KRAMER  Go ahead, drink it, George. GEORGE  (Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..   (Scene ends)  (Ambulance)  (George's strapped down on a gurney. His face is purple, and he's screaming. Jerry and Kramer are trying to calm him down. The driver and the assistant in the   back are having a huge fight) GEORGE  (In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!  DRIVER  (To Assistant) I didn't take your Chuckle, man!  ASSISTANT  I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing!  DRIVER  I don't even like Chuckles! JERRY  (To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.  GEORGE  My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!  ASSISTANT  I want that Chuckle! You hear me?!  JERRY  (To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?  ASSISTANT  (Angry, to Driver) Pull over! DRIVER  Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!  ASSISTANT  Yeah! JERRY  You're gonna fight? GEORGE  Now?! I'm a mutant! KRAMER  (To Driver) Hey, let me drive. ASSISTANT  Come on, man. Pull over! DRIVER  Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!   (Ambulance comes to a screeching halt. Driver gets out, and the assistant heads for the back door)  JERRY  (Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.  GEORGE  My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!  ASSISTANT  I'm gonna kick his ass. KRAMER  (To Assistant) Hey, you have keys?  GEORGE  You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!   (The Assistant leaves. Jerry, Kramer, and George watch the two fight)  JERRY  All this for a Chuckle. KRAMER  What's a Chuckle? JERRY  It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.   (Scene ends)  (Doctor's car)  (He's still holding Elaine's tongue) DOCTOR  You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.  ELAINE  Can you let go of my tongue now? DOCTOR  What? ELAINE  Let go of my tongue! DOCTOR  (Lets go) Oh, sorry. ELAINE  Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?  DOCTOR  I was going to kiss you good night.  ELAINE  A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)   (Scene ends)  (Ambulance)  (It's now moving. The driver's behind the wheel, but the assistant is nowhere in sight)  JERRY  You just can't leave him out there.  DRIVER  I told him I was gonna mess him up.  KRAMER  Well, can you call him an ambulance?  DRIVER  I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!  KRAMER  hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!  DRIVER  (Turns back, facing Kramer) Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!  JERRY AND KRAMER  Watch out!  (The Ambulance crashes into something)  (Scene ends)  (Hospital room)  (George is in the bed, watching TV, wearing a neck brace. Jerry enters limping and wearing a neck brace, also. He talks to George, but George can't respond   verbally) JERRY  How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his   eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's   that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went   to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?   (Elaine enters) ELAINE  Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice   cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.   (Nurse enters) JERRY  Hey, check the TV.  (The TV is showing the same exact movie Jerry was watching at the start of the show)  TV VOICE  (Germanic) It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha..  JERRY  (Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so   funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.   (George throws the whole carton of ice cream over the separating curtan)  MAN  Aaahhhgggg!  (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter   how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. \"Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better   in my life.\" Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know,   becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, \"I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these.   Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!\"     THE END>",

        "text": "   THE DEAL Written by   Larry David   (Comedy club) JERRY  I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, \"What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.  JERRY  What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?  ELAINE  Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?  JERRY  He was good in Man From Uncle. ELAINE  Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?  JERRY  I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.  ELAINE  Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.  JERRY  No, I don't wanna see the naked people.  ELAINE  Been a while? JERRY  I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.  ELAINE  I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.  JERRY  I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)  ELAINE  What? JERRY  What? ELAINE  What was that look? JERRY  What look? ELAINE  The look you just gave me. JERRY  I gave a look? ELAINE  Yes. JERRY  What kind of look? ELAINE  I know that look. JERRY  Then what was it? ELAINE  Why should I tell you? JERRY  Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.  ELAINE  Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...  JERRY  What? ELAINE  What about the look? JERRY  I don't know. ELAINE  You got something on your mind? JERRY  No. Things pop into your head. You?  ELAINE  Things occur to me from time to time.  JERRY  Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.  ELAINE  No, of course not. JERRY  I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?  ELAINE  Thirty-seven. JERRY  Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)  ELAINE  We know the terrain. JERRY  No big surprises. ELAINE  Nope. JERRY  What do you think? ELAINE  I don't know. What do you think? JERRY  Well, it's something to consider. ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  I mean, let's say we did. ELAINE  What if. JERRY  Is that like the end of the world or something?  ELAINE  Certainly not. JERRY  Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?  ELAINE  I know. JERRY  I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.  ELAINE  It's almost stupid if we didn't. JERRY  It's moronic. ELAINE  Absurd! JERRY  Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.  ELAINE  We, there are always a few. JERRY  I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.  ELAINE  Devastating. JERRY  Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)  ELAINE  And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)  JERRY  That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.  ELAINE  Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.  JERRY  But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.  ELAINE  Huh. JERRY  For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.  ELAINE  Right. JERRY  But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.  ELAINE  Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.  JERRY  Beautiful. Let's make it a rule. ELAINE  All right, sir. JERRY  Now here's another little rule. When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.  ELAINE  Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!  JERRY  Well now we're gettin' somewhere. ELAINE  What about the kiss goodnight? JERRY  Tough one. You're call. ELAINE  It's brug-wa (?). JERRY  Fine. Well. ELAINE  Well. JERRY  You ready? ELAINE  Ready. JERRY  So think you can handle this? ELAINE  Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Got the paper? JERRY  Not yet. KRAMER  No paper? JERRY  I haven't been out yet. KRAMER  Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)  GEORGE  What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?  JERRY  No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?  GEORGE  Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?  JERRY  Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.  GEORGE  Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.  JERRY  I thought you'd like that. GEORGE  Oh, this is huge! JERRY  I know. GEORGE  All right, okay. Let's go, details.  JERRY  No, I can't do details. GEORGE  You wha? JERRY  I can't give details. GEORGE  No details? JERRY  I'm not in the mood. GEORGE  You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!  JERRY  All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.  GEORGE  Where are you sitting? JERRY  On the couch. GEORGE  Next to each other? JERRY  No, separated. GEORGE  Time? JERRY  About eleven. GEORGE  Okay, go ahead. JERRY  So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.  GEORGE  Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.  JERRY  And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.  GEORGE  Boy, these are really bad details.  JERRY  It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.  GEORGE  Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.  JERRY  Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.  GEORGE  Better than before? JERRY  She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.  GEORGE  This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?  JERRY  Not exactly. GEORGE  Not exactly. What does that mean? JERRY  Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands oiut of his seat)  GEORGE  Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done. (He sits back down) Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.  JERRY  I think we've worked out a system.  GEORGE  Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.  JERRY  No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls.  GEORGE  Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.  JERRY  Okay. No calls the next day. GEORGE  (To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.  JERRY  You ready for the second one? GEORGE  I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.  JERRY  Spending the night. Optional. GEORGE  No, you see? You got greedy. JERRY  No, that's the rule. It's optional.  GEORGE  I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. I could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.  JERRY  I think you're wrong. GEORGE  I hope I am. JERRY  Is this yours or the roommate's? ELAINE  The roommate's. JERRY  Would she mind? ELAINE  She keeps track of everything. JERRY  Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.  ELAINE  Thanks. JERRY  Well, guess I'll get going. ELAINE  Oh. JERRY  Well, I have that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.  ELAINE  Fine, go away. JERRY  I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.  ELAINE  Just go. JERRY  I'm having surgery tomorrow. ELAINE  Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.  JERRY  But you said, it can be very serious.  ELAINE  Okay, so fine. Go. JERRY  What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.  ELAINE  Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.  JERRY  It has nothing to do with whose house it is.  ELAINE  Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)  TINA  Hi. ELAINE + JERRY  Hi. TINA  Hi, Jerry. JERRY  Hi. TINA  Such a great improv class tonight.  ELAINE  Oh really? TINA  I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.  ELAINE  Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?  TINA  Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)  ELAINE  What are you doing? JERRY  I can't go if you're mad. ELAINE  I'm not mad. JERRY  You seemed a little mad. ELAINE  No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.  JERRY  So you're okay with everything? ELAINE  Definitely. Are you? JERRY  Definitely. Well, goodnight. ELAINE  Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?  JERRY  What? ELAINE  Rules. TINA  Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)  GEORGE  What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.  JERRY  No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.  GEORGE  Maybe I'll get her some jewelry. JERRY  No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.  GEORGE  What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?  JERRY  You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.  GEORGE  What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.  JERRY  I think I heard her say something about a bench.  GEORGE  A bench? What kind of a bench? JERRY  I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.  GEORGE  What, like at a bus stop? JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  Like a park bench? JERRY  I have no idea. GEORGE  Who puts a bench in their house? JERRY  Forget the bench. GEORGE  I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?  JERRY  No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.  GEORGE  Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.  JERRY  Nice looking fellow. GEORGE  What about candle holders? JERRY  Too romantic. GEORGE  Lingerie? JERRY  Too sexual. GEORGE  Waffle maker. JERRY  Too domestic. GEORGE  Bust of Nelson Rockefeller. JERRY  Too Gubernatorial. (?) GEORGE  Let's work on the card. JERRY  Maybe you won't like it. ELAINE  Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.  JERRY  You could not like it. ELAINE  Just the fact that you remembered means everything.  JERRY  Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)  ELAINE  Cash? JERRY  Would do you think? ELAINE  You got me cash? JERRY  Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?  ELAINE  Who are you, my uncle? JERRY  Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.  ELAINE  Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)  KRAMER  Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)  ELAINE  Pal? You think I'm your pal? JERRY  I said, \"and more.\" ELAINE  I am not your pal. JERRY  What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)  ELAINE  Oh, what is this? You got me something?  KRAMER  Yeah. Open it. ELAINE  Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)  KRAMER  That's pretty good, huh? JERRY  Great. KRAMER  Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.  JERRY  Well goody for you. KRAMER  Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?  JERRY  182 bucks. KRAMER  Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.  ELAINE  (Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.  KRAMER  (To Jerry) Yates. ELAINE  Oh Kramer. (They embrace) JERRY  Could you excuse us please? KRAMER  What? JERRY  We're talking. KRAMER  Oh, the relationship. (He leaves) JERRY  You know, we never had one fight before this deal.  ELAINE  I know. JERRY  Never. ELAINE  Ever. JERRY  We got along beautifully. ELAINE  Like clams. JERRY  It was wonderful. ELAINE  A pleasure. JERRY  So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.  ELAINE  I can't do it. JERRY  You what? ELAINE  I can't do that. JERRY  You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. What do you want?  ELAINE  This, that, and the other. JERRY  Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?  ELAINE  You. JERRY  (Starts to correct then realizes) Well...  GEORGE  Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.  JERRY  I never should have made up those rules.  GEORGE  What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?  JERRY  It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.  GEORGE  You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.  JERRY  What did you end up giving her? GEORGE  91 dollars. JERRY  Sorry about that. GEORGE  So what're you gonna do? JERRY  Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.  GEORGE  So, maybe this should be it. JERRY  Could be it. GEORGE  She seems like an it. JERRY  She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...  GEORGE  We'd have to kill him. JERRY  We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.  GEORGE  I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.  JERRY  Plus, you know what else. GEORGE  You better call her. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  You got the paper yet? JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?  ELAINE  No. KRAMER  Well, you're not reading it now. ELAINE  All right, you can take it. But I want it back.  KRAMER  Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?  ELAINE  Ah, this. And that. JERRY  And the other. KRAMER  Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits) THE END>",

        "text": "   THE BABY SHOWER Written by   Larry Charles   (Night club) JERRY  Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching.   You know, we just keep going, \"Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. \" \"What are you watching?\" \"I don't care, I gotta keep going.\" \"Who was that?\" \"I don't know what it   was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going.\" Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, \"Well, let me see what the   show is before I change the channel.\" You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before   there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their   entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, \"Alright start telling me a story,   what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next   guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of   here. I'm going to bed.\"  (Scene ends)  (Coffee shop) GEORGE  (Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.  JERRY  She's the performance artist, right?  GEORGE  (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.  JERRY  What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?  ELAINE  Todd. JERRY  Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.  ELAINE  No, he's not. JERRY  C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.  ELAINE  By marriage. JERRY  Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on   bad directions. GEORGE  That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.  ELAINE  Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.  GEORGE  What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?  JERRY  Thin ice, George. Thin ice.. GEORGE  (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.  ELAINE  She stopped performing. GEORGE  (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.  JERRY  (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.  GEORGE  She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her \"performances\".  JERRY  Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?  GEORGE  God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red   shirt. ELAINE  It was an accident! GEORGE  Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all   over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a   groveling worm. \"What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?\"  JERRY  (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.  GEORGE  And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I   was dirt. JERRY  What ever happened with the shirt?  GEORGE  I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.  ELAINE  I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.  JERRY  Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?  ELAINE  anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.  GEORGE  Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.  JERRY  Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.  GEORGE  (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker. ELAINE  Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's   all so boring.. GEORGE  She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!  ELAINE  (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.  GEORGE  Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.  ELAINE  See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..  JERRY  But? ELAINE  My roommate has Lyme disease. JERRY  Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?  ELAINE  She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.  JERRY  How did she get Lyme disease? ELAINE  I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.  JERRY  They still do that play? ELAINE  It's a classic. JERRY  With all the nudity? ELAINE  I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.  GEORGE  (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!  JERRY  Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.  ELAINE  What do you wanna know? JERRY  Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?  ELAINE  Rarely. JERRY  There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?  ELAINE  No. JERRY  When is this suppose to be? ELAINE  Saturday. JERRY  Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?  ELAINE  I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.  JERRY  'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off   the table. GEORGE  Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.  JERRY  And if you do? GEORGE  I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's TV's not giving a clear picture. He messes with the dials as Kramer looks over his shoulder)  KRAMER  What are you doing this for? Look at you..  JERRY  Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.  KRAMER  But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.  JERRY  (Pleading) Leave me alone. KRAMER  It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!  JERRY  I'm not getting illegal cable! KRAMER  Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.  JERRY  No, I read in the paper.. KRAMER  (Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper.. JERRY  Well, they might hook us up again.  KRAMER  Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the \"Big Mammoo.\" (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things..   Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!  JERRY  Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.  KRAMER  Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!  JERRY  What you're suggesting is illegal.  KRAMER  It's not illegal. JERRY  It's against the law. KRAMER  Well, yeah. JERRY  (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?  KRAMER  (Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's   like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.  JERRY  A real human rights nut, huh? KRAMER  Yeah. He's intense, man. JERRY  I don't know. What if I get caught?  KRAMER  Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.   (Kramer drops the rabbit ears, and goes to his apartment. He then returns with a Russian cable guy - Anatoly Tabachnick, and his assistant. Tabachnick mumbles,   shakes, laughs, then wanders around the apartment. Jerry looks confused)  JERRY  You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.  TABACHNICK  Tomarrow okay. KRAMER  No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.  JERRY  (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..  KRAMER  No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..  JERRY  (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.  KRAMER  You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's   gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry enters carrying luggage. A group of nem in suits are waiting for him)  MAN  Mr. Steinfeld? JERRY  Seinfeld. MAN  We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?  JERRY  My cable hook-up? What about it? MAN  It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.  JERRY  It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?   (An agent leads Kramer out of the bedroom into the living room)  KRAMER  Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.  MAN  You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.  JERRY  Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian   guy is the guy you want.  (Tabachnick steps out of the bedroom. He's dressed like the other FBI men, and speaks without an accent now)  TABACHNICK  Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover.   (Jerry looks around for an excape, then makes a mad dash for the door)  KRAMER  No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his   hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..   (Scene ends)  (Airplane)  (Jerry shudders when looking back on his dream. A stewardess approaches)  JERRY  Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?  STEWARDESS  I'm afraid not. JERRY  What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?  STEWARDESS  No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.  JERRY  (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?   (The passenger, Bill, next to him offers his hand) BILL  My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human   beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, \"This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I   don't belong here.\"  (Scene ends)  (George's car)  (George is driving while wearing an unzipped coat, and a sweater with a bright red collar under it. Jerry's riding shotgun)  GEORGE  Sounds like a rough trip. JERRY  Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.  GEORGE  So, the college cancelled the gig?  JERRY  Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.  GEORGE  (Modestly) Forget it. JERRY  No, really.. an airport run. GEORGE  It's nothing. JERRY  Hey, it's one thing if I asked you \"Could you do me a favor?\" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything -   yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.  JERRY  (Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.  GEORGE  (Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.  JERRY  Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.  GEORGE  (Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?  JERRY  Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.  GEORGE  My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.  JERRY  You want to get a bite? GEORGE  Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.  JERRY  Well, so what should we do? GEORGE  Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?   (Jerry's suddenly suspicious. He notices George's red collar, then reaches over and pulls the sweater down)  JERRY  Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!  GEORGE  (Nervous) What are you talking about?  JERRY  You're wearing the chocolate shirt!  GEORGE  I am? What a strange coincidence..  JERRY  A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..  GEORGE  (Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.  JERRY  What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?  GEORGE  No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, \"Remember this   shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!\"  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Leslie is talking to a group of people, including Elaine) LESLIE  We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.  ELAINE  So, where's Todd? LESLIE  Up in Hyannisport. ELAINE  Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!  WOMAN  (To Leslie) So, when's your due date?  LESLIE  March twentieth, nine a.m. WOMAN  You know the time! LESLIE  I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic.  ELAINE  Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?  LESLIE  (Takes a bite of food) Elaine, who catered this, Sears?   (Kramer bursts through the door, followed by Tabachnick and his assistant. Tabachnick looks over a woman, and nods approvingly. The woman freeze at the sight,   then disperse nervously) ELAINE  (Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?  KRAMER  We're putting in cable. ELAINE  The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!  KRAMER  Oh, we have to do this now.  (Tabachnick and his assistant are leering at the women) ELAINE  Who's this guy? KRAMER  Which one? ELAINE  Both of the them. KRAMER  Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys. ELAINE  Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?  KRAMER  Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.  ELAINE  You can't! You can't do this now! KRAMER  Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.  ELAINE  Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.  KRAMER  (Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a   load off and watch something on Lifetime.  (Scene ends)  (George's car) JERRY  And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?  GEORGE  (Boiling) What am I going to say?!  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What,   you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be   ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have   the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like   you! JERRY  You'll never say that to her face.  GEORGE  Watch me.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment) KRAMER  (Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.  ELAINE  (To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!  KRAMER  Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy,   they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?   (Tabachnick and his assistant start to argue, then they start fighting)  ELAINE  Kramer! KRAMER  (Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..   (Everyone's watching the fight. Kramer breaks it up. Tabachnick walks to the bathroom while his assistant returns to work. Tabachnick bangs on the door, and   shouts in Russian. A woman finally gets out. Tabachnick gets into the bathroom and slams the door shut. Jerry and George enter. Elaine runs up to greet them)  ELAINE  What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.  JERRY  The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.  ELAINE  I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.   (Leslie approaches them) LESLIE  Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town.  JERRY  Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.  ELAINE  (Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!  GEORGE  (Unconvincingly coy) About what? TABACHNICK  (Sticks his head out the door) Kramer, Kramer, Kramer..   (Kramer rushes over, and quickly closes the bathroom door as Tabachnick joins his assistant at the food table. George is ready for Leslie - he takes off his sweater,   revealing the chocolate stain. He walks over to Leslie) GEORGE  Leslie. LESLIE  Yeah? GEORGE  George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.  LESLIE  Hi. GEORGE  (Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?  LESLIE  Vaguely. GEORGE  You took me to one of your shows..  LESLIE  And? GEORGE  And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..   (Scene cuts to Jerry) MARY  Jerry?! (A woman, angry at Jerry, approaches him. Jerry looks confused) Remember me?  JERRY  I'm sorry, I.. MARY  (Livid) Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows.  JERRY  (Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..  MARY  Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.  JERRY  Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..  MARY  Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong,   Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!  JERRY  No, I don't think that.. MARRY  Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your   attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!   (She feigns, spitting on the floor near Jerry's shoes, and storms out. Scene cuts to George. Leslie's bored to death)  GEORGE  Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..   (Mary runs for the door, pushing Leslie into George. Her chocolate cake is now all over George's shirt)  LESLIE  Thanks a lot!  (Scene cuts to the front door. Elaine is saying goodbye to a few women who are rushing out the door)  ELAINE  I'm sorry you have to go. WOMAN  Yeah. I really have to be going.  (Scene cuts to Jerry. He notices the cable guys) JERRY  Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.  KRAMER  Don't be a fool. TABACHNICK  You don't want? JERRY  No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..  TABACHNICK  (Confers with his assistant, then) Four hundred dollars.  JERRY  (To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!   (Scene cuts to Elaine by the door. Leslie has her coat on, and is ready to leave)  LESLIE  I'm going.. obviously. ELAINE  Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..  LESLIE  Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college.  ELAINE  (Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) \"Like you were in college\"?  LESLIE  (Comes back, and yells in the direction of the bedroom) Come on! Let's go!   (George comes out from the bedroom, carrying all the shower gifts - embarrassed)  GEORGE  (Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)  JERRY  (Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's TV screen is cracked. George and Elaine are slumped on chairs)  GEORGE  Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?  ELAINE  Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.  JERRY  Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?  KRAMER  (Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)   (Scene ends)  (Night club) JERRY  What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you   say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. \"I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other   people. You won't be around me. But you will be around.\" \"Take care now.\" Did you ever say that to somebody? \"Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm   not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now.\" \"Take care. Take care.\" What does this mean? \"Take off!\" Isn't that what you really want to say?   \"Take off now.\"      THE END>",

        "text": "         THE CHINESE RESTAURANT Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Comedy club) JERRY  (A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call,   hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the   phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them   right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the   street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you   know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, \"Yeah,   operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear   that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?\"   (Jerry, Elaine &amp; George enter the Chinese restaurant) ELAINE  No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as   that. GEORGE  Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's   much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and   garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.  JERRY  I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make   it one job, 'cop\\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to   do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get   right back to sweeping. ELAINE  You should run for mayor. JERRY  Ehh, nobody listens. ELAINE  Where is someone? I'm starving. GEORGE  I think this is him right here. ELAINE  Is there a table ready? RESTAURANT MANAGER  How many? ELAINE  How many? JERRY  Is Tatiana coming? GEORGE  I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very   lucky she's even considering seeing me at all. JERRY  Really? I thought things were going OK.  GEORGE  They were, it's kinda complicated.  JERRY  Well what is it? ELAINE  How many? JERRY  Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld. BRUCE  Four. It'll be five, ten minutes. GEORGE  What do you wanna do? ELAINE  Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.  JERRY  We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we   wanna make it to the movie. GEORGE  I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?  JERRY  Tatiana...  (George goes over to the public phone. There's a guy using it)  GEORGE  Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?   (guy on phone just turns the other way without answering) BRUCE  Lashbrook(sp?), 4! JERRY  So did I do a terrible thing? ELAINE  You mean lying to your uncle? JERRY  I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night   only, the big screen. My hands are tied! GEORGE  You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just   chit-chat. ELAINE  Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.  JERRY  Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.  GEORGE  He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.  ELAINE  Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?  JERRY  Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.  ELAINE  Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.  GEORGE  I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity?   What kind of a world do we live in?  (Jerry stares at someone) ELAINE  What? JERRY  There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair,   striped shirt? ELAINE  I've never seen her before. JERRY  I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.   (a group of people comes in, one of them bumps into Elaine)  MAN  Oh, Excuse me. ELAINE  I'm sorry.  (the group just walks right into the dining room) ELAINE  Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.  JERRY  Well maybe they were here from before.  ELAINE  No no no, they weren't here before.  GEORGE  Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a   very important call.  (guy on phone turns away again) ELAINE  Find out what's going on! JERRY  Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of   them. ELAINE  Yeah. BRUCE  What's your name? JERRY  Seinfeld.  (Bruce starts talking to a Chinese woman in Chinese) BRUCE  No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2!  ELAINE  Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table?   They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make   you sick. JERRY  Boy, you are really hungry. GEORGE  Hey!  (guy on phone smiles at him and turns back. George, annoyed, goes over to Jerry)  GEORGE  If anything happens here, can I count on you?  JERRY  What? GEORGE  If we decide to go at it. JERRY  Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...  GEORGE  I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit.   It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate   this guy. ELAINE  I'm gonna faint... JERRY  George, who is that woman in the stripes?  GEORGE  I don't know her. JERRY  She looks so familiar. ELAINE  Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It   should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and   taking some food off somebody's plate. JERRY  I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.  ELAINE  What do you mean? JERRY  You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say   anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I   give you 50 bucks. GEORGE  What are they gonna do? JERRY  They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell   for the rest of their lives. ELAINE  50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?  JERRY  50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.  ELAINE  OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and   find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or   something... JERRY  No, no tricks. ELAINE  Should I do it, George? GEORGE  For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.  ELAINE  Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.   (Elaine goes over to the table, smiling) ELAINE  I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are   standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of   your eggrolls.  (the people at the table are confused) ELAINE  I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.  PEOPLE AT TABLE  What? What is she talking about? What did she say?   (Elaine runs from the table, laughing) JERRY  What happened? ELAINE  Did you see that? GEORGE  What were you doing? ELAINE  I offered them 25, they had no idea...  JERRY  George, the phone's free. GEORGE  Alleluia.  (as George reaches for the phone, a woman snatches it and starts dialing)  GEORGE  Excuse me, I was waiting here. WOMAN AT PHONE  Where? I didn't see you. GEORGE  I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!  WOMAN  Well I won't be long. GEORGE  That's not the point. The point is I was here first.  WOMAN  Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.  GEORGE  You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed   to act in a civilized way.  (he goes over to Jerry and Elaine) GEORGE  Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity   over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!   (guy on phone approaches George) GUY  Hey, sorry I took so long. GEORGE  Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.  ELAINE  How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around,   see what dishes look good. JERRY  I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?  GEORGE  Yeah, well, he probably bought it.  JERRY  So what happened with Tatiana? GEORGE  I shouldn't even tell you this. JERRY  Come on... GEORGE  Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.  JERRY  I'm with you. GEORGE  Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like   right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove.   You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and   it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this   impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great   lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as   this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily...   extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know   that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm   going to need... JERRY  This could only happen to you. GEORGE  So I finally stop and say, \"Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the   wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left\". JERRY  You said this to her after. GEORGE  No. During. JERRY  Oh, boy. GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Wow! So...? GEORGE  So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this   unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman,   and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might   possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very   sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her   to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's   (gestures towards woman on phone) still on the phone.  (Elaine comes over) ELAINE  I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back   here again. JERRY  Who is that woman?! ELAINE  Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember,   it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never   saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and   exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them   to fill up the trough. GEORGE  She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)  ELAINE  Jerry, talk to that guy again. JERRY  What am I gonna say? ELAINE  Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.   (as Jerry approaches Bruce, a man walks in) MR. COHEN  Hey, what stinks in here? BRUCE  Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.  MR. COHEN  Well, I've been looking for a better place.   (Bruce laughs) BRUCE  Better place... Want a table? MR. COHEN  No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here.  BRUCE  Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a   table. JERRY  Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that   guy, he just came in. BRUCE  Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here. ELAINE  He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?  BRUCE  Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.  ELAINE  Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!  GEORGE  She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those   people wouldn't get off the phone. JERRY  Didja leave a message? GEORGE  Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the   phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm   expecting a call. ELAINE  Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...  JERRY  Where do I know her?  (woman in stripes approaches Jerry) LORRAINE  Hello, Jerry! JERRY  Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'? LORRAINE  How is everything? JERRY  Good, good, good... What's goin' on?  LORRAINE  Oh, working hard. And you? JERRY  Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.  LORRAINE  You haven't been around in a while.  JERRY  I know, I know... Well, you know. LORRAINE  You should come by. JERRY  Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.  ELAINE  Hi, I'm Elaine. LORRAINE  Lorraine. Catalano. JERRY  I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...   (They all laugh, then silent) LORRAINE  Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she   leaves) ELAINE  Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!  JERRY  Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in   big, big trouble. ELAINE  The one you broke the plans with tonight?  JERRY  Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and   tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna   call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls   this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda   Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt   to my mother, my mother to my uncle... JERRY  ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.  ELAINE  You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in   over with. It's just a movie. JERRY  Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8   from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst   movie ever made!  (Elaine nods) JERRY  Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a   table immediately. ELAINE  Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some   money. JERRY  In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?  ELAINE  Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy   who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks. GEORGE  20 bucks? Isn't that excessive? ELAINE  Well what do you want to give him, change?  GEORGE  It's more than the meal! JERRY  Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.  GEORGE  Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!  JERRY  I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?  GEORGE  Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered.   Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.  ELAINE  I guess it's you, Jer. JERRY  Me? What about you? ELAINE  Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.  JERRY  The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world   of bribery, can they? ELAINE  Give me the money.  (Elaine stands close to Bruce, trying to get his attention)  ELAINE  How's it going'? BRUCE  Very busy.  (Elaine holds the money in front of Bruce) ELAINE  Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.  BRUCE  Very good specials tonight.  (Elaine puts the bill on the open reservations book) ELAINE  If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate   it. BRUCE  What is your name? (he turns the page over the money)  ELAINE  No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)  BRUCE  Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.  ELAINE  Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take   it!  (Bruce shrugs and takes it) BRUCE  Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready.  ELAINE  No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you   see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.  JERRY  You lost the 20. ELAINE  Well, how could he do that? GEORGE  You didn't make it clear. ELAINE  Make it clear? JERRY  What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.   (goes over to Bruce) Excuse me. I realize, this is extremely embarrassing, my   friend here apparently made a mistake. BRUCE  Your name? JERRY  Seinfeld. BRUCE  Yeah, Seinfeld 4! JERRY  No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?   (Elaine waves at him, smiling) BRUCE  Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?  JERRY  Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant   here. BRUCE  Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-  JERRY  Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?  BRUCE  Oh. In about five, ten minutes.  (Jerry goes over to Elaine and George) GEORGE  So? JERRY  There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.  ELAINE  So when are we gonna eat? JERRY  Five, ten minutes. GEORGE  We should have left earlier. I told you.  JERRY  I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.  ELAINE  Oh, well I have to eat. JERRY  Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.  ELAINE  Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?  JERRY  We'll eat it in the movie. ELAINE  Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big   picnic tables there? JERRY  Well what do you suggest? ELAINE  I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.  JERRY  I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction,   let's just eat popcorn or something. BRUCE  Cartwright? ELAINE  I can't have popcorn for dinner! BRUCE  Cartwright? ELAINE  I have to eat! JERRY  So they have hotdogs there. ELAINE  Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.  GEORGE  I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me   just check.  (goes over to Bruce) GEORGE  Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?  BRUCE  Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like   that. Nobody came up, I hang up. GEORGE  Well, was it for Costanza or... BRUCE  Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered.  GEORGE  Well was it a woman? BRUCE  Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up.   (George comes over to Jerry and Elaine, stunned) GEORGE  She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.  JERRY  Who's Cartwright? GEORGE  I'm Cartwright! JERRY  You're not Cartwri- GEORGE  Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the   movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood. ELAINE  Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.  JERRY  So You're not going? ELAINE  You don't need us. JERRY  Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic   remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.  GEORGE  Should we tell him we're leaving? ELAINE  What for? Let's just get out of here.   (they all leave) BRUCE  Seinfeld, 4?  (closing monologue) JERRY  Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is  cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you  know, \"This is good, who is this? I like this person\". You know, I mean, I  would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very  deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to  wake up) \"Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do  you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!\"      THE END>",

        "text": "  THE BUSBOY Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Night club) JERRY  I'm not a foodie. I don't, \"Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty.\" Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls   off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a   hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little   book. What is this? The story of the bill? \"Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people..\" What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating   from the restaurant? What is this about?  (A restaurant)  (Jerry, George, and Elaine are all eating at an Italian restaurant. George hasn't eaten anything)  ELAINE  Do you want some of mine? JERRY  Take some of mine. GEORGE  Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.  JERRY  Who said you have to like it? GEORGE  Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.  JERRY  I don't like pesto. GEORGE  Where was pesto 10 years ago? JERRY  (Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age   wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs. ELAINE  (Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns   back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.  (George has started eating Elaine's food - and continues to do so)  JERRY  (To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.  GEORGE  That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.  JERRY  I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.  GEORGE  Who? JERRY  Elaine is having a \"houseguest.\" She's picking him up at the airport tonight.  GEORGE  A guy? ELAINE  (Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.  JERRY  He's from a.. Yakima, right? ELAINE  Seattle. JERRY  Everybody's moving to Seattle. GEORGE  It's the pesto of cities. So..? ELAINE  (To Jerry) You tell him. JERRY  Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.  ELAINE  Ed. JERRY  Who was in town on a business venture, and um..  ELAINE  ..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.  JERRY  So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.  ELAINE  On some people. GEORGE  Oooh. JERRY  So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.  ELAINE  It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.   (The menu at a neighboring table catches fire. Elaine quickly picks up a wine glass - about to put it out, but George tosses the menu on the floor, and stomps it out.   The manager approaches) MANAGER  What happened? GEORGE  Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.  MANAGER  Sorry to the disturbance. ELAINE  (Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.   (Manager leaves) JERRY  (Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining   room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble. GEORGE  Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The   busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!  ELAINE  I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.  JERRY  (Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.   (The busboy takes of his apron, throws it down, and exits the restaurant)  GEORGE  I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!  ELAINE  Oh, I said it in a kidding way. GEORGE  I didn't know he'd get fired. JERRY  (Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.  GEORGE  What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!  JERRY  (Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.  GEORGE  Was it my fault? ELAINE  Was it my fault? JERRY  (Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.   (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of   grueling interviews. GEORGE  (Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.  JERRY  Oh, like you do. GEORGE  Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.  JERRY  (Scoffing) Camp. GEORGE  It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.   (The intercom buzzes, Jerry talks through it) JERRY  Elaine? ELAINE  (Through intercom) Yeah.  (Jerry pushes a button on the intercom - letting her in) JERRY  Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.  GEORGE  Then why don't you try and get him another job?  JERRY  I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.   (Elaine enters) ELAINE  I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.  GEORGE  What? Did you get the busboy's number?  ELAINE  His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my   job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?  (Jerry hands the car keys to Elaine) GEORGE  How did you get all this? ELAINE  Does the word \"charm\" mean anything to you?  JERRY  No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.  GEORGE  (Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.  JERRY  You, you're going now? GEORGE  Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.  JERRY  Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?  ELAINE  I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.  JERRY  I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?  GEORGE  It'll take to long.  (Kramer enters) JERRY  Take the K-man. A little support..  GEORGE  (Unsure) I don't a.. KRAMER  Take me where? Where?  (An apartment building hallway)  (George's nervous - standing with Kramer infront of the busboy's apartment)  GEORGE  Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.  KRAMER  What am I gonna say? GEORGE  I don't know. KRAMER  Well, I'm not an idiot. GEORGE  Certainly not. KRAMER  Then we're cool. GEORGE  Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother   you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey)   I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I   just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.  KRAMER  (Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.  GEORGE  This is a guy I know.. Kramer.  (Antonio, the busboy, is watching them suspiciously) KRAMER  ¿Habla espanol? GEORGE  (To himself) Oh my God. ANTONIO  Si. KRAMER  ¿Como se dice.. waterbed? GEORGE  (Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that.   (Pause) Well, I guess that's about it. KRAMER  You got anything to drink? ¿Agua? GEORGE  Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.  KRAMER  Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)  GEORGE  Hurry up. ANTONIO  (Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic)  KRAMER  His cat's gone. ANTONIO  (Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door   open? (Silence) Who left the door open?! (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on, come on! Help me look! (All three head out the door to look)   (Antonio's apartment)  (All three sit in silence) KRAMER  ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in   their brains where they remember where they're from. Unless, of course, somebody else starts feeding him. See, that's what you gotta worry about.  GEORGE  (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A   lamp breaks) the lamp. KRAMER  The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.  GEORGE  (Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him,   angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)  KRAMER  You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)   (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  (On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine.   (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.  KRAMER  It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.  JERRY  (Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.  KRAMER  Oh? How do you figure? JERRY  (Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.  KRAMER  Why was I in charge of closing the door?  JERRY  (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!  KRAMER  So! JERRY  (Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!  KRAMER  Let me talk to him. JERRY  (To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)  ELAINE  Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?   (Jerry pitches her the keys as she goes some tward his bathroom)  JERRY  No hello? ELAINE  Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?  JERRY  Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car. ELAINE  Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my   life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.  JERRY  (Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?  ELAINE  I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?  JERRY  There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?  ELAINE  Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!  JERRY  So, you two been, uh.. ELAIEN  No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to   go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..  JERRY  What's your airport route? ELAINE  I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.  JERRY  ..What about the Van Wyck? ELAINE  I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.  JERRY  Oooh. ELAINE  Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?  JERRY  You still using that old alarm clock?  ELAIEN  Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in   the face.  (Night club) JERRY  Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss   that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it,   that's it. No airline goes, \"Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon,   you have to change cannons after you land.\" (Imitates cannon operator) \"I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a   second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net   immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you.\"   (Elaine's apartment) 15 - they overslept. She gets frantic)  ELAINE  (Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 9:15!  ED  9:15? ELAINE  Yes! 9:15! ED  (Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.  ELAINE  Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get   dressed! Get dressed! ED  Can I shower? ELAINE  Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!  ED  I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.  ELAINE  Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase.   He walks tward the door) Where are you going? ED  The kitchen. ELAINE  The kitchen?! ED  I've got a bag of cashews in there.  ELAINE  They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!  ED  What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.  ELAINE  No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!  ED  I'll never make it. ELAINE  Don't say that! ED  But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.  ELAINE  Shut up and pack! ED  And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?  ELAINE  You're talking too much! ED  Where's my sweater? ELAINE  What?! ED  My brown sweater. ELAINE  What? What sweater? ED  My brown sweater. ELAINE  You didn't bring a brown sweater. ED  I brought a brown sweater. ELAINE  Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!  ED  That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.  ELAINE  It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)  ED  What are you doing?! ELAINE  NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)  ED  My shoes. You packed my shoes. ELAINE  Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over   her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!   (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Anywhere in the city? GEORGE  Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.  JERRY  Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth? GEORGE  Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.  JERRY  Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth. GEORGE  (Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.   (Elaine enters. She's still wearing her nightclothes under her coat. Her hair is messed up. She's been through quite an ordeal)  ELAINE  (Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in   slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws   of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's   ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway   Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!  GEORGE  The busboy's coming? JERRY  You don't mean here? KRAMER  Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..  GEORGE  He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.  JERRY  Where are you going? GEORGE  I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.  JERRY  (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.  KRAMER  No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.  GEORGE  Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..   (There's a knock in the hallway) KRAMER  Antonio. In here!  (Antonio enters) GEORGE  (Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?   (Antonio crosses over to George, and gives him a hug) ANTONIO  Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired   that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again)  GEORGE  (Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..   (The intercom buzzes) ELAINE  (Into the intercom) Yeah? ED  It's Eddie. ELAINE  He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..  ANTONIO  And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making   before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am   starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves)   (Everyone ad-libs congratulations to George. Then, we hear a fight erupting from the hallway)  ED  Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!  ANTONIO  Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!  ED  Who do you think you're talking to, pal?  ANTONIO  Hey, get your hands off me! ED  Go to hell!  (Antonio screams out profanity in Spanish, then we hear them getting into a serious fight)   (Coffee shop) JERRY  He'll get another job. He's a busboy!  GEORGE  It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.  JERRY  It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.  GEORGE  That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.  ELAINE  Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.  GEORGE  So, much longer? ELAINE  Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?  GEORGE  (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.  ELAINE  Take care of yourselves. (Leaves) GEORGE  I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.  JERRY  Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?   (Night club) JERRY  First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an   amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring   in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, \"Didn't you see my signal?\" \"Look at that fender!\" ..Then you'd see a real fight.     THE END>",

        "text": "   THE NOTE Written by   Larry David   Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. \"Oh, is he good?\" \"Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best.\" They  can't all be the best.  There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, \"You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah,  he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got,  it'll be worse after you see him.  He's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher.\"? And then there's always that, \"Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me.\" Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, \"Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. Everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs.\"   (Jerry is getting a massage.) JULIANNA  ...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want. JERRY  What do you think the worst part of being blind is?  JULIANNA  Excuse me? JERRY  You know, if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would   be? JULIANNA  I don't know. JERRY  I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food.  How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue. JULIANNA  Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.  JERRY  You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania? JULIANNA  No. JERRY  He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone. JULIANNA  Oh. JERRY  Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people. JULIANNA  Have you seen any good movies? JERRY  Who takes care of your boy during the day?  JULIANNA  We have a woman. Why? JERRY  No no. I'm just saying. JULIANNA  She had references. JERRY  I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge them. You know I think this is really helping.  JULIANNA  I don't live near here, ya know!  Jerry, Elaine and George are at Jerry's apartment. JERRY  So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.  ELAINE  I don't like to talk during a massage.  JERRY  Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.  GEORGE  Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here. ELAINE  Oh! I forgot to tell you-- JERRY  I'm in the middle of a story. ELAINE  Okay, go ahead. GEORGE  Why don't you ever go shopping? JERRY  Not like it's a really funny story or anything.  ELAINE  What happened? JERRY  Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and the for some reason I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.  ELAINE  Oh, wasn't that terrible? JERRY  Yes, it was. GEORGE  Not even an apple. ELAINE  She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.  JERRY  I know it was stupid. ELAINE  Really stupid. JERRY  Hey, I just said it was stupid. GEORGE  What about this leftover Chinese food?  JERRY  Take it. ELAINE  I can't believe you said that. JERRY  Hey, would you stop it already? ELAINE  So, what did she say? JERRY  I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.  GEORGE  This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. ELAINE  I have a good masseuse you could go to.  JERRY  Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical   therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance. GEORGE  Physical therapy is covered by insurance?  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  You don't have to pay for the massage?  JERRY  Not if you have a doctor's note. ELAINE  So where do you get this note? JERRY  Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist. GEORGE  Right, your friend Roy. ELAINE  What's the name of this physical therapist?  JERRY  I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off. GEORGE  And you don't have to pay.  George and Elaine are at the physical therapist's office. GEORGE  We have three-o'clock appointments.  RECEPTIONIST  George and Elaine, right? Could you fill these out for me please? And Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna, and George, you'll be with Raymond. GEORGE  Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'? RECEPTIONIST  Yes. GEORGE  But, uh, Raymond is a man. RECEPTIONIST  That's right.  George sits down slowly, letting this sink in. GEORGE  I can't get a massage from a man. ELAINE  Why not? GEORGE  What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.  ELAINE  No, I don't want the man either. GEORGE  What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you. ELAINE  He'd just be touching your back. GEORGE  He'd just be touching your back too.  ELAINE  No, it could get sexual. GEORGE  I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you. ELAINE  I wouldn't be comfortable. GEORGE  I would? What if something happens?  ELAINE  What could happen? GEORGE  What if it felt good? ELAINE  It's supposed to feel good. GEORGE  I don't want it to feel good. ELAINE  Then why get the massage? GEORGE  Exactly!  A man walks up dressed in white. RAYMOND  George? GEORGE  Yes? RAYMOND  I'm Raymond. GEORGE  Hello. RAYMOND  Are you ready?  George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond.  George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond. George appears extremely uncomfortable. RAYMOND  ...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office. GEORGE  Really. RAYMOND  I used to be a flight attendant. GEORGE  Oh boy. RAYMOND  Ya know, why don't you open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way.  George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down his hips then starts massaging his lower back. RAYMOND  So what do you do? GEORGE  What? RAYMOND  I said, 'What do you do?'. GEORGE  I don't know. RAYMOND  You don't know what you do? GEORGE  Nah. RAYMOND  Oh, come on. Hey, you're very tense.  GEORGE  Coffee. Too much coffee. RAYMOND  Okay, just take off those pants now, I'll work the hamstring.  GEORGE  Oh, the hamstring's fine. RAYMOND  But you wrote that it was tender. GEORGE  I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote. RAYMOND  I'll check it out. GEORGE  Are you sure? RAYMOND  Yeah, take 'em off.  George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond rubbing his hands with oil. Nervous, George pulls his pants down and climbs back on the table. As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid with discomfort. RAYMOND  How did you hurt this? GEORGE  I don't know. RAYMOND  You don't know? GEORGE  No. RAYMOND  But you just told me-- GEORGE  Korea. RAYMOND  You hurt it in Korea? GEORGE  What? RAYMOND  The hamstring. GEORGE  Korea. RAYMOND  How? GEORGE  Hamstring. RAYMOND  How did you hurt the hamstring? GEORGE  Hotel.  Elaine is in the waiting room, George walks out very slowly, he appears positively shell-shocked. ELAINE  How'd it go? George?  George walks right out the door, ignoring Elaine.  Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone. JERRY  No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.  George enters acting nervous. JERRY  What's with you? GEORGE  A... JERRY  Yes, A...? GEORGE  A man gave me... JERRY  Yes, a man gave you...? GEORGE  A man gave me... a massage. JERRY  So? GEORGE  So he... had his hands and, uh, he was...  JERRY  He was what?! GEORGE  He was... touching and rubbing. JERRY  That's a massage. GEORGE  And then I took my pants off. JERRY  You took your pants off? GEORGE  For my hamstring. JERRY  Oh. GEORGE  He got about two inches from... there.  JERRY  Really? GEORGE  I think it moved. JERRY  Moved? GEORGE  It may have moved, I don't know. JERRY  I'm sure it didn't move. GEORGE  It moved! It was imperceptible but I felt it.  JERRY  Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side. GEORGE  No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.  JERRY  Okay, so what if it moved? GEORGE  That's the sign! The test; if a man makes it move.  JERRY  That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves as a result of contact. GEORGE  You think it's contact? It has to be touched?  JERRY  That's what a gym teacher once told me.   Kramer enters. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut. JERRY  Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts? KRAMER  Yeah. Joe DiMaggio. JERRY  I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts. KRAMER  Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts. GEORGE  I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch. JERRY  I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy   smelly Dinky Donuts. KRAMER  Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?  JERRY  He can have a donut, but not at Dinky.  GEORGE  I don't even like to use urinals, I've always been a stall man.  KRAMER  Look I'm telling-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling you, that was Joe DiMaggio. GEORGE  The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy. JERRY  I never said I'd do that. GEORGE  What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that. JERRY  I don't know how I feel about it. GEORGE  Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?  JERRY  Alright, alright. KRAMER  A stall man, huh?  George and Jerry are in Roy's office. JERRY  ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine. GEORGE  He didn't say he can't. JERRY  I mean, if you feel funny about it at all.  GEORGE  He doesn't feel funny. JERRY  If he does. GEORGE  Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.  JERRY  He feels funny. You don't have to do this.  GEORGE  He knows that! JERRY  Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?  GEORGE  Oh, can you be any more dramatic? ROY  Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall)  Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he? GEORGE  How would I know? ROY  Do you like him? GEORGE  What do you mean, like him? ROY  Do you like him? GEORGE  I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.  ROY  How come you don't like him? GEORGE  Why should I? JERRY  What is the matter with you? GEORGE  Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?  ROY  So, you want the notes? JERRY  You don't have to, really. ROY  Nah nah, it's ok. JERRY  We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?   Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.  JERRY  Well what about the week after? No appointments at all? (Jerry tries to sit down on the couch, but Elaine is too close to the end and he has to squeeze in between her and the arm to sit down) Can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you? ELAINE  What? JERRY  Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.  ELAINE  Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.   Kramer enters. KRAMER  Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.  JERRY  Uh huh. ELAINE  Joe DiMaggio? KRAMER  Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied his every move. For example, he dunks.  ELAINE  Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut? KRAMER  That's right. JERRY  See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.  KRAMER  Oh, he's a dunker. ELAINE  Why couldn't he be a dunker? KRAMER  And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.  ELAINE  So then what? KRAMER  Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out. ELAINE  Why didn't you just call out his name?   George enters, his pants are ripped at the knee. JERRY  What happened to you? GEORGE  One of those kids called me a Mary.  ELAINE  A what? GEORGE  I was jumping over a puddle and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) They called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell. KRAMER  Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.  ELAINE  Hey, George? What is this? (Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?  George heads for the bathroom, the phone rings, Kramer answers it, Jerry grabs it from him. JERRY  Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god, how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud. KRAMER  ...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe... JERRY  I told you. GEORGE  Told me what? JERRY  I told you we shouldn't do it. GEORGE  He didn't say anything. JERRY  He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes. ELAINE  Three notes? JERRY  Yeah, you, me and George. ELAINE  You got me a note? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  But I got my own note. JERRY  You what? ELAINE  I got a note from my gynecologist.  JERRY  Why'd you do that? ELAINE  I didn't know you were getting me a note.  JERRY  Of course I was getting you a note.  ELAINE  But you didn't say anything. JERRY  Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors. KRAMER  How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yeah.  Kramer leaves.  Jerry and George are at Roy's office. JERRY  Hi Pam. PAM  Hello. GEORGE  Hello. JERRY  I just thought maybe I could talk to Roy.   Roy walks in. ROY  Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi.  JERRY  Hi Roy. GEORGE  How ya doing? ROY  Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.   Roy, Jerry and George are talking over a woman sleeping in a dental chair.  JERRY  I don't even know what to say. GEORGE  Me neither. JERRY  I knew this would happen. GEORGE  Me too. JERRY  I mean the whole thing, it's just...  GEORGE  Tragic. JERRY  Well it's not tragic. GEORGE  No? JERRY  No, it's... GEORGE  Unsettling? JERRY  Okay. I mean, what if the--  Pam walks in and interrupts. PAM  I hope you're both happy. JERRY  I'm not happy. GEORGE  Me neither. I've never been happy.  JERRY  I mean I'm happy sometimes, but not now.  GEORGE  In college, maybe. Those were fun times.  JERRY  Yeah, college was fun.  Pam walks in again and interjects. PAM  You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, you know that?  ROY  Don't mind her. JERRY  Oh please, I love her. GEORGE  I've just met her but I'm very impressed.  ROY  I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.  JERRY  What's the next move, what's gonna happen now?  ROY  Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along   with our story. JERRY  What? The physical therapist? Why?  ROY  She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.   The woman in the chair wakes up and looks at Jerry and George.  GEORGE  How ya doing?  Jerry and George are at Julianna's office. JERRY  Hi. Look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna. RECEPTIONIST  I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not it.  JERRY  Yeah, I know she's mad at me but I really have to speak with her.  RECEPTIONIST  I told you, she's not here. JERRY  You don't understand. RECEPTIONIST  Look, you have to leave. JERRY  Wait a second, don't you-- (Julianna walks up with her child) Hi. Hi.  Look, I don't know what you-- JULIANNA  Please! JERRY  --but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is   inadvertently sent an insurance-- JULIANNA  I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!  JERRY  Can't you just listen to me? JULIANNA  Run Billy! Run to the office and close the door! (to the receptionist) Call the police!  Julianna then runs down the hall. JERRY  The police?  Raymond the masseuse walks up. RAYMOND  Hi George. GEORGE  Hello. JERRY  Raymond?  Elaine, Jerry and George are at the coffee shop. ELAINE  Well, I mean it's only six months probation, it's a slap on the wrist.  JERRY  Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.  GEORGE  Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle. ELAINE  Of what? Oh. GEORGE  And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say \"Get out of here!  What do you want? You don't belong here!\" ELAINE  What do they do? GEORGE  They talk back. They go, \"Hey George, how's it going?\" I say, \"Get the hell out of here!\"  Jerry spots Kramer through the window. JERRY  Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention)  Maybe it's time you got as different hobby.  Kramer enters and sits at the booth. KRAMER  I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.   The three all put down their coffee cups simultaneously. JERRY  Did he say anything? KRAMER  No no, he's fine. JERRY  Oh my god, it's... GEORGE  Joe DiMaggio. KRAMER  Where? JERRY  Having a cup of coffee. ELAINE  He's dunking! JERRY  Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper. Here.  GEORGE  You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please. KRAMER  Wait, wait. *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* See? I told you.   (Closing monologue)  What causes homophobia? What is it that makes a heterosexual man worry? I think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, \"Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'\"  THE END>",

If you insist o making pasta in my   apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the   strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.

And as we speak, at this very   moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she   has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.

She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump   them. GEORGE  Oh, no. We left on good terms. JERRY  How is that possible? GEORGE  Because I uh, I told her the truth.  JERRY  Oh, my God. GEORGE  It's OK. JERRY  It's unheard of ... GEORGE  She asked me to. JERRY  So you lie! What did you tell her?  GEORGE  I told her that she was pretentious.  JERRY  Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was   pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they   want ELAINE  How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?  GEORGE  Like what? What could they say? ELAINE  There are plenty of things to say.  GEORGE  Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?  ELAINE  George, please. GEORGE  Give me one. ELAINE  You sure? GEORGE  Yes. ELAINE  What? ELAINE  Forget it. You are very careful with money.  GEORGE  I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't   believe this. How could you say that to me? ELAINE  You asked me to. GEORGE  You should have lied. ELAINE  HUH, so should you. JERRY  OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?  GEORGE  (ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.  ELAINE  I know. GEORGE  When I was working I spent baby. JERRY  Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?  GEORGE  She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.  ELAINE  Pocketbook or a handbag? JERRY  Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.  GEORGE  Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ...   what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ...

Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits) JERRY  Not good  (break)  Jerry's Apartment KRAMER  Yeah, it's a windshield. JERRY  I can see that. What's it for? KRAMER  I found it on the road. JERRY  Yeah (to buzzer) ELAINE  (from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?  JERRY  Come on up. KRAMER  Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a   coffee table out of this and surprise Tina. JERRY  wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's   in front of the couch? KRAMER  wow  (Elaine enters - she and Kramer avoid each other's stares) ELAINE  hell-oo KRAMER  hell-oo JERRY  What's with you two? ELAINE  You haven't told him? JERRY  Tell me what? ELAINE  Huh, go ahead, tell him. KRAMER  I, I saw her naked. ELAINE  He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.  KRAMER  Well, you know, ... it was an accident.  ELAINE  Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!  KRAMER  I thought it was a closet. JERRY  Completely naked? KRAMER  Completely naked. ELAINE  Jerrryyy, How can I go on? KRAMER  All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.   (Kramer begins disrobing) ELAINE  No thanks! KRAMER  No, I want you to see me naked. ELAINE  No, no no. KRAMER  No, I want to show you. ELAINE  No! Jerry! Jerry! JERRY  OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my   home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.   (Kramer sits down picks up windshield) ELAINE  Ehat is this? KRAMER  Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.  ELAINE  Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.  JERRY  You'll sense it.  (George enters slowly) JERRY  Well, what happened? Was she there?  GEORGE  No, no she wasn't. JERRY  You didn't get my papers? GEORGE  No, I didn't. JERRY  Well, where is she? GEORGE  A mental institution.  STAND UP ROUTINE  Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have   clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments that people like   to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good   (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're   naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's   nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I   feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and   lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be,   wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand   in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.  =  Jerry's Apartment JERRY  A mental institution? KRAMER  You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in   your head. GEORGE  It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression   clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over   this. ELAINE  Who told you this: GEORGE  Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.  KRAMER  My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.  JERRY  You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any   information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS! GEORGE  She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.  JERRY  So what now? GEORGE  I don't know. JERRY  Can we go out there? GEORGE  Where? JERRY  Woodhaven. GEORGE  We could.  Woodhaven GEORGE  I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.  JERRY  My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to   my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin'   \"where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?\" GEORGE  I should be in a place like this I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear   slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I   like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association   tests. I love those. JERRY  That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.  GEORGE  Potato JERRY  Tuberculosis GEORGE  Blanket JERRY  Leroy GEORGE  Grass JERRY  Tuberculosis GEORGE  Oh, boy. Here she comes.  Elaine's Apartment  (African music is playing as Elaine enters, dirty pots and dishes are piled high in the kitchen)  ELAINE  Oh, my god.  (Kramer enters dancing with only a towel on.) ELAINE  KRAMER! KRAMER  Hey. ELAINE  WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON. KRAMER  Uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.  TINA  Kramer, are you coming back to bed?  KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.  TINA  Oh, hi Elaine. (returns Elaine's ear rings) What did you think of the coffee table?  ELAINE  It's invisible. KRAMER  So, is everything cool? or what? TINA  Yeah, you seem little bit dysfunctional.  ELAINE  Well, TINA  Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth.  ELAINE  The Truth!, You want The Truth?  Woodhaven PATRICE  Who are you? GEORGE  Oh, this is my friend Jerry. PATRICE  Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?  JERRY  Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things   about you from George. PATRICE  George thinks I'm pretentious. GEORGE  Pretentious? Who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was   pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental   institution. PATRICE  You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.  GEORGE  No, that's not it at all. PATRICE  Don't LIE George. GEORGE  I'M NOT A LIER! GEORGE  Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)  JERRY  Just chatting. Friendly. GEORGE  All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.  PATRICE  I know what you said. You can't change that.  GEORGE  What I said? I saw stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.  JERRY  It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places,   what do you bring your pocketbook? GEORGE  You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.  PATRICE  You mean that? GEORGE  Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.  JERRY  He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket book.   Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.  PATRICE  Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I   got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies.  JERRY  there are no copies. PATRICE  So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?  JERRY  Who makes copies?  Elaine's Apartment ELAINE  The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.   (Elaine exits) KRAMER  Oh, TINA  Kramer,  (dancing in the dark to the music) TINA  Here Kramer? KRAMER  No, lets go to the couch...  (sound of smashing glass)  Jerry's Apartment  ( JERRY  (on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer thatI bought there....   it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might   have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.  JERRY  Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.  ELAINE  I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.  JERRY  George? GEORGE  I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks,   Supposed to be good.  (Kramer enter - all bandaged up. KRAMER  Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?  ELAINE  Yeah, I suppose I am. KRAMER  All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.  JERRY  You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.  GEORGE  Hey, I'm getting in on that. ELAINE  You know you're chippin' in. GEORGE  You're going that way anyway!  (Comedy club)  I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun  about it, you know.   But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take  all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake  and just kinda crank it around there.  You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I  mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go \"Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!\"     THE END>",

I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? \"You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks.\" Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: \"No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back.\"   (Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents) HELEN  (looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 7:30. Call the airlines again.  MORTY  (searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.  HELEN  Oh I think that's them! MORTY  You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.   (Jerry and Elaine enter) ALL  Hi, welcome, greetings, hugs, etc.  MORTY  Welcome to Florida! ELAINE  Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug) JERRY  Hey, there's the old man! (hug) MORTY  So, what took you so long? JERRY  We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.  HELEN  I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.  JERRY  What's the difference? HELEN  You could have used our car. JERRY  I don't wanna use your car. HELEN  What's wrong with our car? JERRY  Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?  HELEN  We don't use it. MORTY  What are you talking? We use it. HELEN  If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.  JERRY  So what would you do? You'd hitch?  HELEN  How much is a rent-a-car? JERRY  I don't know. 25 bucks a day. HELEN  What? You're crazy. MORTY  Plus the insurance. JERRY  Oh, I didn't get the insurance. MORTY  How could you not get the insurance?  HELEN  We'll pay for the car. JERRY  You're not paying for it. HELEN  Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)  JERRY  God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?  HELEN  You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?  JERRY  It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?  HELEN  Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.  JERRY  (ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.  ELAINE  (looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?  JERRY  The lake isn't real. HELEN  The lake is real. MORTY  Are you kidding? They built the lake.  HELEN  But it's real. It's water.  (Jerry and Elaine take their luggages to the guest room) HELEN  Where are you going with those? JERRY  I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.  HELEN  Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.  ELAINE  I can't take your bedroom. HELEN  I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.  ELAINE  I can't kick you out of your bed. HELEN  We don't even sleep. JERRY  Ma. HELEN  But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.  JERRY  (to Morty) What about you? MORTY  Why should I be comfortable? JERRY  (to Helen) What about him? HELEN  Don't worry, he's comfortable. MORTY  I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.  HELEN  Will you stop? ELAINE  Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)  HELEN  (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.  JERRY  No that's not such a good idea. HELEN  Well I tought that... JERRY  Not now. She's right inside. HELEN  (quieter) What happened? JERRY  I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.  HELEN  What does that mean? JERRY  Well... MORTY  (comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?  JERRY  Shh! Nothing, nothing. HELEN  Elaine... MORTY  (still loud) What about her? JERRY  (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggages, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem to be friend when we sleep together.  MORTY  (Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? :-) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.  HELEN  He's an idealist. MORTY  What the hell are you looking for?  JERRY  I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.  HELEN  He likes looking. MORTY  So look. HELEN  But how long can you look? JERRY  I'm going for the record.  (Morty walks away with a face like he disagrees with Jerry)  HELEN  You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.  JERRY  Oh, come on. HELEN  This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.  this is Jack and Doris, neigboors)  MORTY  Aha! DORIS  So they arrived safely. MORTY  (to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?  JERRY  Nice to meet you. This is Elaine. ELAINE  Hi. Nice to meet you. JACK  So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?  ELAINE  And scuba diving. HELEN  Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?  JERRY  We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.  HELEN  What do you have to go scuba diving for?  JERRY  For fun. HELEN  For fun? MORTY  Jack have some spong cake. JACK  No. thanks, no. MORTY  Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.  JACK  So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skit tommsorow?  JERRY  I don't think so. JACK  No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).  MORTY  What did you have? You had the minute steak?  JACK  Yeah. MORTY  Did you have a coke or what? JACK  I did NOT have a coke. MORTY  Somebody had a coke. HELEN  Oh I had a coke. DORIS  And I had the scampi. JACK  So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.  MORTY  All right. Make it 20 bucks. JACK  It's: 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)  MORTY  19.45$ ? JACK  See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.   (Jerry notices Klompus's pen) JERRY  What kind of pen is that? JACK  This pen? JERRY  Yeah. JACK  This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.  JERRY  Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?  JACK  Oh it was a gift. JERRY  Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen works.  JACK  Take the pen. JERRY  Oh no. JACK  Go ahead. JERRY  I couldn't JACK  Come on, take the pen! JERRY  I can't take it. JACK  Do me a personal favor! JERRY  No, I'm not... JACK  Take the pen! JERRY  I cannot take it! JACK  Take the pen! JERRY  Are you sure? JACK  Positive! Take the pen! JERRY  O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!  HELEN  Jack, what are you doing? JACK  Stop it! DORIS  Jack, we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice to meeting you.  ELAINE  Mmm, nice to meet you. JERRY  Thanks again. JACK  Come on! DORIS  (to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)  HELEN  (as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?  JERRY  What he gave it to me. HELEN  You didn't have to take it. MORTY  Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.  JERRY  He offered it to me. HELEN  Because you made such a big fuss about it.  JERRY  I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?  HELEN  You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)  JERRY  He could have said: \"Thank you, I like it too\" and put it back in his pocket.  HELEN  He loves that pen. MORTY  Oh come on! HELEN  He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.  JERRY  If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.  HELEN  He didn't think you'd accpet. JERRY  Well, he was wrong. HELEN  I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (againe we see Elaine smiling at their argument)  JERRY  So you want me to return it? HELEN  Yes. MORTY  He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.  JERRY  Hey I don't even want the pen now!  MORTY  Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!  ELAINE  Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it wrtites upside down.   (scene ends)  (condo's guest room)  (Elaine is lying on the sofa bed. It's too hot. She can't fall asleep)   (knock on door) ELAINE  Come in. JERRY  Are you O.K. in here? ELAINE  Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?  JERRY  It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.  ELAINE  Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.  JERRY  Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.  ELAINE  I am never gonna fall asleep. JERRY  Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me.  ELAINE  How can they not put the air conditioning on?  JERRY  They're nuts with temperature. ELAINE  This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.  JERRY  How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?  ELAINE  I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.  JERRY  It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)   (scene ends)  (condo, morning)  (Jerry and Morty are sitting at the table, Helen is at the counter. Elaine's still sleeping? Well, she's still in the guest room.)  MORTY  Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?  JERRY  Stay on Biscayne. HELEN  You're going underwater? JERRY  Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.  HELEN  What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?  JERRY  What's so special up here?  (Elaine open the guest room's door and she's in pain) ELAINE  Oh!  (everybody get up and walk to her) HELEN  What's the matter? ELAINE  My back. HELEN  What happened? ELAINE  That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.  HELEN  (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.  JERRY  Then YOU would be hunched over. ELAINE  I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.  JERRY  You can't go? HELEN  So stay home. ELAINE  You can go. JERRY  Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.  HELEN  Don't go. JERRY  You sure? MORTY  Maybe you should see a doctor. JERRY  We'll stay in a hotel tonight. ELAINE  (whispering to Jerry) Yes! HELEN  No, we'll stay in there. JERRY  Why don't you get a new sofa? MORTY  Nobody uses it. JERRY  I'm buying you a new sofa. HELEN  Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy. ELAINE  Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.  HELEN  You're hot? ELAINE  I've lost 6 pounds. HELEN  I don't even know how to work it. MORTY  I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.   (Evelyn, a neighboor, enters) EVELYN  Is everybody up? JERRY  Hi. How are you? EVELYN  Hello Jerry. JERRY  Evelyn, this is Elaine. ELAINE  (with pain) Hi Evelyn. EVELYN  Jerry you got thin. JERRY  Too thin? HELEN  Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.  EVELYN  So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question)  JERRY  (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?  EVELYN  The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.  HELEN  How did you know that? EVELYN  Blanche told me. HELEN  Blanche? EVELYN  That's some good pen. It writes upside down.  ELAINE  The astronauts use them. HELEN  What did Blanche say? EVELYN  I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.  JERRY  I never really wanted the pen. MORTY  He gave him the pen. HELEN  Morty. EVELYN  Why you don't like the pen? JERRY  No, no, I... EVELYN  Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.  HELEN  Is that what she said? EVELYN  Who? HELEN  Blanche. EVELYN  What are you talking about?  (The phone rings, Helen answers.) HELEN  Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)  ELAINE  Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!  MORTY  (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.   (the phone conversation is over. Helen looks at Jerry.) JERRY  All I said was \"I like the pen\".  (Morty looks at the control panel for the air conditioner) MORTY  How the hell do you work this thing?   (scene ends)  (still the condo, later)  (Jerry's gone scuba diving. Elaine is lying on the floor with pillows under her legs. Morty and Helen are on the couch, looking at Elaine. Helen is wearing a sweater and she's freezing)  HELEN  Maybe you shouldn't go tonight. ELAINE  No no, I wanna go. HELEN  But your back hurts. MORTY  Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.  ELAINE  Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.  HELEN  No. I'm fine. ELAINE  You're not too cold? HELEN  No.  (Jerry enters with a black eye) JERRY  Don't be alarmed. MORTY  Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?  JERRY  I'm O.K. My capillaries burst. HELEN  Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?  JERRY  (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?  ELAINE  Having a good time! JERRY  Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?  HELEN  What happened to your eyes? JERRY  Well I started to go under... HELEN  With the instructor? JERRY  Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.  HELEN  I told you...  (Jack enters, all dressed-up, smoking a cigar) JACK  Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?  ELAINE  My back hurts. JACK  Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.  MORTY  We got plenty of time. JACK  (to Jerry) What happened to you? JERRY  I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.  HELEN  It's from scuba diving. JACK  What's there to see underwater? give him back the pen) JERRY  Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.  JACK  You what? JERRY  I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he tends the pen to Jack)  JACK  Well I mean... JERRY  Take it. JACK  All right! (he smiles and take it)   (Morty gets up and walks right to Jack) MORTY  You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.  JACK  Whose pen? MORTY  His pen. JACK  This happens to be my pen. MORTY  You didn't give it to him. JACK  What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.  MORTY  Where do you come off with this crap?  JACK  Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?  MORTY  You said you didn't want it! JACK  Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!  MORTY  Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?   (Jerry and Elaine can't beleive what they're hearing) JACK  Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!  MORTY  Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!  JACK  Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!  MORTY  I don't want it! JACK  I don't want it! MORTY  You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!  JACK  Listen do you think I give a damn?  MORTY  Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that'it for them.  JERRY  What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?  HELEN  I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)  JERRY  Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?  MORTY  yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.  JERRY  Well. This should be a very interesting evening.  ELAINE  (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?   (scene ends)  (reception room, evening)  (Morty, Helen, Elaine and Jerry are standing for a photograph in the entrance. Jerry wears sunglasses and Elaine is all drugged-up on muscle relaxers.)  PHOTOGRAPHER  Say astronaut.  (Elaine is laughing for nothing and she walks right up to the lens of the camera.)  ELAINE  Say what? (laughing) Say what? JERRY  (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.  MORTY  Astronaut? HELEN  Say it. ELAINE  (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!   (the image frozes and we see that the picture is awful, with Jerry and his sunglasses, and Elaine laughing who can barely stand.)  MORTY  Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?  JERRY  Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)  JERRY  (to Leo) Uncle Leo. LEO  Hello! STELLA  Morty are you nervous? MORTY  What nervous? LEO  (to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?  JERRY  I've got a black eye. STELLA  (to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.  JERRY  Elaine, this is my aunt Stella. HELEN  (shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!  JERRY  (to Stella) Her back hurts. STELLA  Humm... We saw you on \"The Tonight Show\" last week.  LEO  I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.  JERRY  No, no. LEO  You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.  ELAINE  (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!  LEO  Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.  MORTY  What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!  LEO  You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.   (Jack and Morty exchange a look.) STELLA  (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing \"Golden Girls\" for this.  HELEN  (laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.  \"Jack let's get started!\" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public: Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.)  JACK  (on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.  MORTY  (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)  JACK  Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)  HELEN  (Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.  JACK  His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.  MORTY  (to Jack, loud) That's what you say.  JACK  But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)  MORTY  (loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)  JERRY  Dad! MORTY  (to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!  JACK  He gave it to me! MORTY  Come on. That's enough, sit down! JACK  I'm not sitting down!  (they start to fight. Morty tries to get the microphone off Jack' hands. He yells to Jack to give him the pen. Jerry gets up and tries to separate them. We hear a feedback from the microphone and they stop to fight)  JACK  Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)  HELEN  Jerry, do your act. JERRY  (in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.  HELEN  They're all gonna leave. JERRY  (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)  MAN IN THE CROWD  Who are you? JERRY  (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?  WOMAN IN THE CROWD  (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.   (Elaine is almost asleep at the table) JERRY  Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?  MAN IN THE CROWD  I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!  HELEN  (to Jerry) Do the dog routine. JERRY  All I said was I liked the pen! ELAINE  (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!   (Everybody stops talking and put their hands on their ears)   (scene ends)  (condo, morning)  (Elaine is sitting on the couch and a chiro is examining her. Jerry's sitting next to her. Helen is standing beside them and Morty is still asleep in the guest room)  CHIROPRACTOR  You could aggravated. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.  ELAINE  Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?  JERRY  There must be some mistake. CHIROPRACTOR  I'm afraid not. ELAINE  (discouraged) Five days. Here. HELEN  (to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!  JERRY  (to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...  ELAINE  Excuse me? JERRY  Nothing.  (Evelyn enters) EVELYN  Good morning. JERRY  Hi Evelyn. EVELYN  (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?  HELEN  I don't think so. EVELYN  Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.  HELEN  I'll ask him when he gets up. EVELYN  Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.   (Morty gets up in a bad shape) MORTY  Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?  HELEN  I was very comfortable. EVELYN  Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.  HELEN  It's in the constitution. MORTY  (to the chiro) Who are you? CHIROPRACTOR  I'm a chiropractor. MORTY  What are you kidding me? ELAINE  (to Jerry) Five more days? JERRY  Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)   (scene ends)  (night club, closing monologue)  THE END>",

        "text": "   THE DOG Written by   Larry David   (Comedy club)  So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!  New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative (and inebriated) man. GAVIN  Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him. JERRY  Is he on the plane now? GAVIN  Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?  JERRY  Uh, just my next door neighbor. GAVIN  You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways   that you never could have thought possible. JERRY  Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?   Gavin leans back in his seat wearing a pained expression. JERRY  What's the matter? GAVIN  Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.  Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the cabin where flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.  ATTENDANT #1  Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you to a hospital. GAVIN  My dog. What about my dog? ATTENDANT #1  Uh, you have a dog? ATTENDANT #2  Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?   Jerry stares out the window. GAVIN  Jerry? JERRY  Huh? How you feeling? GAVIN  Would you take care of Farfel? JERRY  Farfel? ATTENDANT #2  It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital, could you take his dog to New York? JERRY  The dog? The dog?? GAVIN  I'm sure it's only for a day or two.  JERRY  But, you know, what if, you know? GAVIN  Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.  JERRY  The dog?  New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up and there's a loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.  JERRY  Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do? ELAINE  Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.  JERRY  STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw. ELAINE  If only. JERRY  Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back. ELAINE  Hey, when you walk him, do ya... JERRY  Do I what? ELAINE  Do you pick it up? JERRY  Yes, I pick it up. ELAINE  You pick it up?!? JERRY  Well you have to. ELAINE  Oh, boy would I love to see that. JERRY  SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?  ELAINE  Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.  JERRY  No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first. ELAINE  No, milk. JERRY  I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.  ELAINE  What is a bender anyhow? JERRY  I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.  ELAINE  I can't believe he hasn't called. JERRY  Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his   dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!  Kramer enters. KRAMER  Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.  JERRY  Why? ELAINE  We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.  KRAMER  I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.  JERRY  You're breaking up? KRAMER  Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah. ELAINE  Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.  KRAMER  Woah, you didn't like her? ELAINE  If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant   Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.  JERRY  I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.  KRAMER  How come you never said anything? JERRY  You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after   they stop seeing them. KRAMER  I tell you. JERRY  You. I'm talking about people. ELAINE  Are we still going to the movies tonight?  JERRY  No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.  ELAINE  Just me and George? JERRY  Sure. ELAINE  But we need you. JERRY  What do you need me for?  Jerry's buzzer buzzes. ELAINE  Because... Yeah? GEORGE  Prognosis Negative!  Elaine buzzes George into the building. ELAINE  Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something? JERRY  No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you! ELAINE  Just me and George alone?  George enters. GEORGE  Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!! JERRY  I can't go. GEORGE  Can't go, Why not? JERRY  Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.  GEORGE  I thought Kramer was watching. JERRY  He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.  GEORGE  Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.  JERRY  No, I don't want that smell in the house.  GEORGE  You spritz a little Lysol on it. JERRY  No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk. GEORGE  So we're not going? JERRY  Nah. You two go. GEORGE  Oh. You still wanna go? ELAINE  Do you? GEORGE  If you want. ELAINE  It's up to you. JERRY  Go ahead. ELAINE  Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon? GEORGE  Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?  JERRY  I want to but I can't. ELAINE  Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night. JERRY  No. GEORGE  What about this-- JERRY  Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.  ELAINE  I know, it's not that. GEORGE  It's just we want you to go. JERRY  Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!   On my block, a lot of people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?   New scene.  George and Elaine are at the coffee shop after seeing Ponce De Leon. They're obviously uncomfortable alone together. GEORGE  So how long did you live there? ELAINE  About three years. GEORGE  That's pretty long. ELAINE  Hmm. GEORGE  It's not that long, really. ELAINE  Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same time, then stop. Another silence. GEORGE  And then you came here. ELAINE  Yeah. So I've been here about six years.  GEORGE  Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight,   eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.  New scene.  Jerry vs. Farfel, part II JERRY  Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!   New scene.  Kramer is breaking up with his girlfriend. KRAMER  I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Couldn't respect myself.  New scene.  Monk's, Elaine and George are as bored as before. GEORGE  I like herbal tea.  Elaine yawns. GEORGE  Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.  ELAINE  Jerry likes Morning Thunder. GEORGE  Jerry drinks Morning Thunder? ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.  ELAINE  Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.  GEORGE  You don't tell him? ELAINE  No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, \"God, I feel great!\" GEORGE  You don't tell him? ELAINE  No. GEORGE  That is so funny! ELAINE  I know! GEORGE  Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!   They both make the same convulsive gestures together and break out in more laughter.  New scene.  Kramer has had a change of heart. KRAMER  Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I'll do anything!  New scene.  Jerry's at his apartment, on the phone, Farfel is barking. JERRY  That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!  New scene.  Jerry and Elaine are cleaning Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.  JERRY  Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.  ELAINE  The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.  Jerry (answering phone) Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, how soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am going. Okay, see you in five minutes.  Jerry hangs up the phone and begins singing and dancing. JERRY  Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What? ELAINE  Do you have to? JERRY  What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog. ELAINE  You know, the guy might have just lost your number.  JERRY  I'm in the book and I have a machine.  ELAINE  Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.  JERRY  Really? How late are they open?  Kramer enters. JERRY  What? ELAINE  What is it? KRAMER  I went back with Ellen. JERRY AND ELAINE  Ohhhhh, that's great. ELAINE  Terrific. JERRY  Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.  ELAINE  Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.  KRAMER  Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?  JERRY  I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.  KRAMER  From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you   don't know me. ELAINE  Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it. JERRY  What are you doing? KRAMER  I'm getting my pot.  Kramer grabs a put from under the counter and walks out. ELAINE  Kramer, we like her. JERRY  Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?  ELAINE  I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.  JERRY  I said, \"How come no one's killed her?\" Probably shouldn't have said anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah? GEORGE  Prognosis Negative!  Farfel begins barking. JERRY  Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on. ELAINE  Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.  JERRY  It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.  ELAINE  Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight. JERRY  I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?  ELAINE  We'll see it Sunday.  George enters. GEORGE  Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?  ELAINE  I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.  GEORGE  What does this mean? JERRY  Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon. GEORGE  What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.  JERRY  She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. GEORGE  Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?  JERRY  I don't know, regular human time? GEORGE  Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?  JERRY  Why shouldn't I go here? ELAINE  Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom. GEORGE  And isn't it more fun using the urinal?  ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!  GEORGE  Hey, go. ELAINE  Who's stopping you? GEORGE  What, are you doing me a favor? ELAINE  Like we care if you go to the bathroom.   Elaine and George, left alone together are obviously uncomfortable.  GEORGE  How's it going? ELAINE  Good. Good. You? GEORGE  Things are good.  After a pause, George starts whistling, then picks a chew toy off the floor and squeezes it towards Elaine, making a squeaking sound. ELAINE  Boy, he takes such a long time. GEORGE  I know. ELAINE  You know what he does in there? He gargles.  GEORGE  Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?  ELAINE  Yeah, he does it like six times a day.  GEORGE  How come we never hear him? ELAINE  Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.  Elaine gargles some water and they both break out in laughter.  GEORGE  Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!  ELAINE  We talked about that already. GEORGE  Oh.  New scene.  Jerry and George are in line outside the Cine 66 theater. GEORGE  I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation. JERRY  So what are calling me six times a day?  GEORGE  All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section. JERRY  I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.  GEORGE  Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.  JERRY  It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?  GEORGE  Nothing except Prognosis Negative.  JERRY  Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.   New scene.  Elaine and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with a jacket. ELAINE  Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!   The phone rings, Farfel begins barking. ELAINE  Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.  Cut back to Jerry and George. GEORGE  I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing. JERRY  I don't know what to do. GEORGE  What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.  JERRY  I know, I know. GEORGE  So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.  JERRY  It is kind of silly. GEORGE  Of course it is. JERRY  I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.  GEORGE  Exactly. JERRY  It's not like she's *in* the movie.  GEORGE  Right. JERRY  Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.  GEORGE  And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.  JERRY  How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level   of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go. GEORGE  Good. JERRY  Saving movies. GEORGE  Ridiculous! JERRY  Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.  GEORGE  Oh, you're dead.  New scene. Jerry's apartment, Gavin has come to collect his dog. Farfel is barking as loud as ever. GAVIN  Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel! JERRY  You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said   you were released on Monday. GAVIN  Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top notch physicians.  KRAMER  Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me! GAVIN  He won't hurt you, he's just playing.  KRAMER  Hey you keep that mutt away from me.  GAVIN  Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.  ELLEN  Kramer, are you coming? JERRY  Oh, hi Ellen. ELLEN  Get in here.  Kramer sulks off. JERRY  Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week,   but if you don't mind... GAVIN  Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out. JERRY  Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.   Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and out of Jerry's apartment.  New scene.  Jerry and Elaine at in Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  We made plans. JERRY  Why don't we just rent a movie? ELAINE  I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.  JERRY  No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. ELAINE  Jerry, you promised me we'd go. JERRY  Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it. ELAINE  Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.  JERRY  You and George got together? ELAINE  Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.   Kramer enters. JERRY  Hello.  Kramer, Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. JERRY  What's up? KRAMER  Well, you were right. JERRY  About what? KRAMER  Ellen. We, uh, broke up again. JERRY  Too bad. ELAINE  I thought she was the one. KRAMER  I'll bring back the pot. ELAINE  Okay, c'mon it's movie time. KRAMER  Hey, what are you gonna see? JERRY  Prognosis Negative. KRAMER  Hey, that's supposed to be great. JERRY  It's not. KRAMER  How do you know? JERRY  I have an instinct for these things.   (Comedy club)  I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, \"Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me.\" But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?  THE END>",

        "text": "  THE LIBRARY Written by  Larry Charles   (JERRY'S APARTMENT) JERRY  Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book   from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?  KRAMER  enters JERRY  Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour.   Bye. KRAMER  What's the problem? JERRY  This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer   in 1971 and never returned it. KRAMER  Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's   going to be $50,000 JERRY  It doesn't work like that. KRAMER  If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000  JERRY  It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly   because I was with Sherry Becker. She waore this orange dress. It was the first time I   ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this   body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...   FLASHBACK (to a beautiful buxom young Becky in an orange dress)  JERRY  That orange dress is burned in my memory  KRAMER  Oh, memory burn. JERRY  I wonder what ever happened to her.  KRAMER  How did they ever find you? JERRY  Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is   completely ridiculous.  (buzzer) JERRY  It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library  KRAMER  You know I never got a library card.  JERRY  (to speaker) Coming down. KRAMER  It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading   the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,  JERRY  I gotta go to the library. You want to go?  KRAMER  Yeah,  LIBRARY KRAMER  The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned   up on that deal. JERRY  Where's George READER  Shhh. KRAMER  Tryin' to save a quarter. JERRY  I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house.   TURNING TO LIBRARY COUNTER JERRY  This woman's completely ignoring me.  KRAMER  Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ...   Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was   a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding.   She needs a little Kramer. JERRY  Eventually a little shot of penicillin  LIBRARIAN  Yes? JERRY  Yes I called before. I got his notice in the mail.  LIBRARIAN  Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our   library investigation officer Mr. Bookman. KRAMER  Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?  LIBRARIAN  It's true. KRAMER  That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.  LIBRARIAN  Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.  JERRY  Can I speak with this Bookman? LIBRARIAN  Just a second.  GEORGE ENTERS, FRANTICALLY, TUGS AT JERRY'S JACKET GEORGE  Jerry, JERRY  What? GEORGE  I think I saw him. I think it's him.  JERRY  Who? GEORGE  Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some   calesthetics routine JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  yeah GEORGE  I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.  READER  Shhh. JERRY  (whispers) Are you sure? GEORGE  He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.  JERRY  George got him fired. He squealed on him.  KRAMER  Ooh tattle tale GEORGE  (yells) I didn't tattle READER  Shh Shh KRAMER  What did this guy do? What happened?  GEORGE  There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.  KRAMER  Oh come on, You can tell me. GEORGE  Some other time. KRAMER  What tonight?  LIBRARIAN WALKS BY KRAMER  Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.  JERRY  Oh, he sang like a canary. LIBRARIAN  Mr. Bookman's not here. JERRY  Not here? Why was I told to come down here?  LIBRARIAN  He'll be out all afternoon on a case.  KRAMER  He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?  JERRY  Well what am I supposed to do now?  LIBRARIAN  I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.  JERRY  All right Thanks. Come on lets go GEORGE  Let's see if it's Hayman? KRAMER  Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do   around here  to get a library card?  PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES ELAINE  Where's Karen? SECRETARY  She went to pick up lunch. ELAINE  She didn't ask me what I wanted. SECRETARY  She must have forgot. ELAINE  How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?   Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting a really weird vibe.   Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK I won't say anything.  SECRETARY  I don't know anything. ELAINE  Ah, you don't know anything. You see, \"I don't know anything\", means there's   something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said \"You're crazy.\"   LIPPMAN ENTERS ELAINE  Oh, hi Mr. Lippman. LIPPMAN  Elaine, ELAINE  Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of   Columbus, I gave you? LIPPMAN  Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.  ELAINE  It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.   AT MONKS ELAINE  I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend.   And then that lunch thing. JERRY  So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!  ELAINE  What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See,   you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!  GEORGE  I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because   I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?  ELAINE  What did he do? GEORGE  He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, \"Costanza\" He'd say,   \"Can't stand ja\".  \"Can't stand ja\" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.  JERRY  I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps   were hangin' down by his ,... GEORGE  OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.  JERRY  I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.  GEORGE  Little baked beans JERRY  Echh ELAINE  Come on tell me what happened. GEORGE  Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym.   ... ME!  FLASHBACK TO HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM GEORGE  ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...  HEYMAN  Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja GEORGE  Yes, Mr. Hayman HEYMAN  Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.  GEORGE  Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.  HEYMAN  Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?  GEORGE  I'm not really sure, I... HEYMAN  Well let's take a look. gets a wedgie)  BACK TO MONK'S GEORGE  He gave me a wedgie. JERRY  He got fired the next day. ELAINE  Why do they call it a wedgie? GEORGE  Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..  JERRY  They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the   waistband on top of the head. Very rare. ELAINE  Boys are sick. JERRY  Well what do girls do ? ELAINE  We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder.   guy who ruined his life.  KRAMER ENTERS KRAMER  Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library   he's waiting for ya.  STANDUP ROUTINE  What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take   out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done.   It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little   kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's   what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody   kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late.   ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?  JERRY'S APARTMENT JERRY  Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would   you like a cup of tea? BOOKMAN  You got any coffee? JERRY  Coffee? BOOKMAN  Yeah. Coffee. JERRY  No, I don't drink coffee. BOOKMAN  Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?  JERRY  No, I don't have-- BOOKMAN  You don't have any instant coffee?  JERRY  Well, I don't normally-- BOOKMAN  Who doesn't have instant coffee? JERRY  I don't. BOOKMAN  You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you   forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts   forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals. JERRY  Really? I'll have to remember that.  BOOKMAN  You took this book out in 1971. JERRY  Yes, and I returned it in 1971. BOOKMAN  Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries.   Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman   telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of   his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But   you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public   Library, fella. JERRY  Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very   specifically. BOOKMAN  You're a comedian, you make people laugh.  JERRY  I try. BOOKMAN  You think this is all a big joke, don't you?  JERRY  No, I don't. BOOKMAN  I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked   it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity   that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?  JERRY  Certainly not. BOOKMAN  Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp,   the one that says \"New York Public Library\"? Well that may not mean   anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.   Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're   thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library   books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without   libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change   the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right   now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees   and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers?   Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue   fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that   that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and   is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!  (Marion sneaks into Kramer's apartment behind Bookman's back as he opens Jerry's   door to leave)  KRAMER'S APARTMENT KRAMER  What's wrong? MARION  It's Bookman the library cop. KRAMER  So I didn't do anything wrong. MARION  I'm supposed to be atwork. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.  KRAMER  Why don't ya' leave? MARION  I can't.  JERRY'S DOORWAY JERRY  No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book I n 1971. I have a witness   Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum.   It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it.   (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...   IN MONKS WITH SHERRY SH  Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha   to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think.  JERRY  So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?  SH  I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.  JERRY  Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?  SH  Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?  JERRY  No Black Jack? SH  Licorice gum? Never! We were reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,  JERRY  Tropic of Cancer. SH  No, Tropic of Capricorn JERRY  Tropic of Capricorn? SH  Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... \"As I have learned from bitter experience   is sexual intercourse .\" JERRY  Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.   We read from TROPIC OF CAPRICORN. I was all set to return TROPIC OF CANCER. And then ...   FLASHBACK TO LOCKER ROOM JERRY  Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.  GEORGE  Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it  JERRY  Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.   BACK TO MONKS SH  Where ya' going? JERRY  It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go.   (to old man that enters)  It was GEORGE!  LIBRARY KRAMER  Read another poem. MARION  Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.  KRAMER  Wow, that is great. You should be published.  KRAMER  You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.  MARIAN  Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: HELLO!  KRAMER  HELLO! MARIAN  HELLO! KRAMER  HELLO! MARIAN  HELLO! BOOKMAN  Hello! MARIAN  Mr. Bookman. BOOKMAN  I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly,   discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life.   We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have   library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final   warning. Got that, kewpie-doll?  JERRY'S APARTMENT  (Jerry in bedroom) ELAINE  Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good  JERRY  Maybe you're getting' a raise.  (buzzer) ELAINE  Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie. ELAINE  What? GEORGE  It's George ELAINE  George is on his way up. JERRY  Wait 'til I tell him about the book.  KRAMER  (reading) sobs ELAINE  Are you OK? What? What? KRAMER  It's marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)  ELAINE  Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT   (Jerry enters). JERRY  I'm right here. ELAINE  Remember that Columbus book? JERRY  Columbus, Euro trash.  (George enters) GEORGE  Well, it's definetly him. ELAINE  Him? Him who? GEORGE  Him who? Hayman him. ELAINE  Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?  GEORGE  Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down   next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus  JERRY  That was double overtime. GEORGE  So I said, \"Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... \" He doesn't move.   So I said uh, \"Can't stand ya'\", \"Can't stand ya'\" He turns and smiles, the little   baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was   Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library ,   a grown man, getting a wedgie. ELAINE  At least it wasn't atomic. GEORGE  It was. JERRY  So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER  GEORGE  How should I know? JERRY  Because I gave it to you. GEORGE  Me? JERRY  Yesah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally   I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.  GEORGE  The locker room!  THE LOCKER ROOM JERRY  Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.  GEORGE  Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.  JERRY  All right, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.  HEYMAN  Can't Stand Ya'. GEORGE  Yes Mr. Hayman. HEYMAN  Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.  GEORGE  Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.  HEYMAN  Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?  GEORGE  I'm not really sure, I... HEYMAN  Well let's take a look.  (George gets a wedgie and TROPIC OF CANCER falls on floor)  LIBRARY  ( Jerry writes out a check for the never-returned TROPIC OF CANCER and hands it to Bookman)  JERRY  Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.  BOOKMAN  Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man   die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody? JERRY  What is your problem? BOOKMAN  What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not   screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a   pitbull on a poodle. JERRY  (after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine)   So you were saying? ELAINE  Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems.   The ones that affected Kramer so much. JERRY  Oh, beautiful did he like them? ELAINE  No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!  JERRY  (to George) Was he out there? GEORGE  Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.  JERRY  I guess we'll never know.  SOME BACK ALLEY HEYMAN  Can't stand ya, (laughing) Can't stand ya. (pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground)   STAND UP  It was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind   of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like   in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly   any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' \"Where's your jock strap?\" Ya' know and kids   are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History,   Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.    THE END>",

IN SINGLE FILE  GEORGE, JERRY and ELAINE, WHO'S CARRYING A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH, AND KRAMER WHO'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE, HEAVY BOX.  GEORGE  One left...what a joke. KRAMER  You can have this one. GEORGE  No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.  ELAINE  Hey, I didn't get one either. JERRY  Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?  ELAINE  This is what people do. JERRY  No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.  GEORGE  You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.  ELAINE  So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?  GEORGE  Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.  JERRY  Big accomplishment. GEORGE Fish. What do they do?  ELAINE  What do you do? KRAMER  (RE: CAR) It's this way. GEORGE  What time is it? JERRY  Five o'clock. GEORGE  Always late. Always late. JERRY  You're not late. GEORGE  I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.  ELAINE  Who? GEORGE  My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?  JERRY  Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.  ELAINE  Isn't it going the other way? JERRY  There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.   ELAINE But it's Saturday. JERRY You got the picnic and burger traffic. GEORGE I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.   KRAMER STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND. ELAINE  What's the matter?  HE MUMBLES SOMETHING AND CONTINUES WALKING. JERRY  I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?   KRAMER STUMBLES WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER. JERRY  You want me to help you with that?  KRAMER  No, no, I got it.  AND HE STUMBLES AGAIN. JERRY SPOTS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. JERRY  (TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?  GEORGE  Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.  KRAMER  If you like her, go talk to her. GEORGE  Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, \"Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?\"  JERRY  Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.  KRAMER  She's fat. ELAINE  Oh she's fat?  KRAMER STOPS AGAIN, CONFUSED. ELAINE  What? JERRY  Where's the car? KRAMER  I thought it was here. GEORGE  You don't know where we parked?  KRAMER LOOKS AROUND, THEN RESUMES WALKING. THEY FOLLOW. GEORGE  Oh, this is great. KRAMER  Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.  JERRY  I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.  ELAINE  I didn't pay attention. GEORGE  This is just what I need. ELAINE  I'm sure it's right around here. KRAMER  It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.  GEORGE  There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.  JERRY  It's over there. I know where it is.   NOW JERRY TAKES THE LEAD AND THE OTHERS FOLLOW. ELAINE  It's black, right? KRAMER  Dark blue. GEORGE  You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?  JERRY  There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.   THEY STOP... JERRY  Hmmm...I thought it was... KRAMER  Didn't we come in over there? JERRY  I thought it was over there. ELAINE  How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?  KRAMER  About two hours. ELAINE  You'd better find this car. GEORGE  It's this way... JERRY  I really have to go to the bathroom.  KRAMER  Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J   JERRY SHOOTS HIM A LOOK. KRAMER  Why? Nobody's around. JERRY  I'll wait. KRAMER  You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. JERRY Alright.  KRAMER  Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?  JERRY  Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.   ANGLE ON ELAINE AND GEORGE... ELAINE  There it is!...No that's not it.  A CAR SCREECHES AROUND A CURVE, ELAINE IS UNNERVED. ELAINE  Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.  GEORGE  ...Six wrong? ELAINE  Those school zones are a killer. JERRY  Will you let me help you with that?  KRAMER  I'm gonna put it down behind that car.   HE DOES SO. JERRY  You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?  KRAMER  Pink eleven. Remember that. GEORGE  Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.  ELAINE  (LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.  KRAMER  Look at this place. It's huge... GEORGE  I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.  JERRY  Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, \"Make sure you hang on to your jacket.\"  GEORGE  Where the hell is this car, Kramer?  KRAMER  It's got to be here. ELAINE  Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.  JERRY  Maybe it's not on this level. GEORGE  What? JERRY  There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?  ELAINE  It felt like a couple of levels. JERRY  You should always carry a pad and pen. GEORGE I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.  KRAMER  I have a pen.  THEY REACT... JERRY  Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, \"Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms.\"  MOTHER  Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?  ELAINE  Look at that woman.  SHE'S HITTING HER BOY ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. MOTHER  I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.  GEORGE  Hey, is that necessary? MOTHER  Why don't you mind your own business?  GEORGE  I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.  KID  You're ugly. GEORGE  ...What? KID  You're ugly. GEORGE  You are! KID  You are!  THE KID GETS IN THE CAR. GEORGE IS STUNNED. GEORGE  I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.  KRAMER  (RE CAR) I found it! ELAINE  He's got it. KRAMER  Oh...no. JERRY  All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?  ELAINE  Jerry, look at my fish.  JERRY HOLDS UP THE BAG AND HITS IT WITH HIS FINGER. JERRY  His eyes look a little cloudy. GEORGE  Oh are they gonna be furious. JERRY  Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!  KRAMER  It was easy the last time. ELAINE  My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.  JERRY  No one's going to do that.  ELAINE SPOTS A FORTY-ISH, STYLISH COUPLE WALKING TO THEIR CAR.  ELAINE  Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.  MAN #1  ...Sorry. ELAINE  Five minutes. MAN #1  Can't do it. ELAINE  We're not wilding.  THEY LEAVE. ELAINE  Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...   THEY START LAUGHING. ELAINE  Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny - These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?   THEY IGNORE HER AND KEEP LAUGHING. CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.  JERRY  Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?  KRAMER  Right here at the mall.  BACK TO ELAINE, SEEKING OUT A MAN WITH A BEARD. ELAINE  Excuse me...  HE IGNORES HER AND KEEPS WALKING. ELAINE  Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.   CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER. JERRY  It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.  KRAMER  You drank a whole bottle of water.  JERRY  I know. KRAMER  So why don't you just go? JERRY  No I can't. KRAMER  Don't you get tired of following rules?  JERRY  You think I'm too cautious? KRAMER  Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.  JERRY  Organic. So's Buddy Hackett. KRAMER  Buddy Hackett? JERRY  He's a comedian. KRAMER  I know. JERRY  All right. All right. KRAMER  (pointing) You can go over here. JERRY  I can manage. KRAMER  (turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)   KRAMER It'll take you ten seconds.  HE NUDGES JERRY. JERRY  Okay, okay. I'll be right back.  WE STAY WITH JERRY AS HE WALKS TO THE BACK OF A CAR, LOOKS AROUND LIKE SUPERMAN, THEN LETS FLY. HE FINISHES, ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS AND SEES A SECURITY GUARD STARING AT HIM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED.  SECURITY GUARD  Okay, let's go. Come with me. JERRY  But... SECURITY GUARD  Come on. JERRY  ...Kramer  INT. SECURITY GUARD'S OFFICE JERRY  I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.  SECURITY GUARD  Well you're still not allowed. JERRY  Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?  SECURITY GUARD  That's up to you. JERRY  So you don't care if I die. SECURITY GUARD  What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.  JERRY  It was life and death. SECURITY GUARD  Uh huh. JERRY  Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.  SECURITY GUARD  I don't know. JERRY  Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.  JERRY  Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.  SECURITY GUARD  You can tell the police all about it.   INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE, KRAMER, AND ELAINE. KRAMER  Jerry! ELAINE  Jerry! GEORGE  Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.  ELAINE  Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.  GEORGE  Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.  GEORGE  If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.  ELAINE  No, no, I'll be back.  SHE LEAVES. GEORGE  Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.  KRAMER  Does that bother you? GEORGE  Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?  KRAMER  Not at all. GEORGE  See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?  KRAMER  I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?   INT. SECURITY OFFICE - JERRY AND THE SECURITY GUARD. JERRY  First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.  SECURITY GUARD  I know what you did. JERRY  Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.  JERRY  And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.  SECURITY GUARD  Yeah I'm sure. JERRY  You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.   INT. PARKING GARAGE - ELAINE, LOOKING FOR JERRY. ELAINE  And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.  MAN #1  I can't do it. ELAINE  But why? Why can't you do it? MAN #1  I can't. ELAINE  No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.  MAN #1  That's right. ELAINE  But why? Why don't you want to? MAN #1  I don't know. ELAINE  But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?  MAN #1  No, I wouldn't.  INT. SECURITY SHACK - JERRY (A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.  JERRY  What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.   INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE AND KRAMER, STILL LOOKING FOR THE CAR.  KRAMER  The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.  GEORGE  Really. KRAMER  What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?  GEORGE  Who's Killer Kowalski? KRAMER  He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.  GEORGE  I've gotta go to the bathroom. KRAMER  So go. GEORGE  Here? KRAMER  You and Jerry.  INT. SECURITY OFFICE - GEORGE BEING LED IN BY THE SECURITY GUARD.  GEORGE  Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...  SECURITY GUARD  Oh your folks have an anniversary today too? Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?  GEORGE  A Red Chinese prison?  INT. PARKING GARAGE - KRAMER, WANDERING AIMLESSLY. KRAMER  George! George!  INT. PARKING GARAGE ELAINE  Jerry!  INT. PARKING GARAGE JERRY  Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.  JERRY  Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.  ELAINE  Jerry! JERRY Elaine?! ELAINE  Jerry! Over here...  NOW THEY SPOT HER. ELAINE  Where have you been? JERRY  I was arrested for urinating. GEORGE  Me too. ELAINE  You what? JERRY  I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.  ELAINE  Look at my fish...  ELAINE  Is he...  JERRY  No, but he's not looking good... ELAINE  Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.  MAN #2  Can't do it. ELAINE  I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?  MAN #3  Sorry. ELAINE  That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.  ELAINE  That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?  GEORGE  Elaine, shut-up. JERRY  Hey, where's Kramer? GEORGE  I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?  ELAINE  I thought he was with you. GEORGE  See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...  GEORGE  Look at the time, that's it. ELAINE  Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side? GEORGE We came in over there!  ELAINE  We didn't come in over there! JERRY Where's Kramer?  JERRY  Hey George, there she is again. ...  GEORGE  So what do you want me to do? JERRY  Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.  GEORGE  That is an opening. GEORGE  Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...  AMY  Oh sure, I'll drive you around. GEORGE  You will? AMY  Sure.  GEORGE WAVES FOR JERRY AND ELAINE. GEORGE  Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.  AMY  I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.  GEORGE  Yeah, right. JERRY  Filthy pigs.  THEY ALL GET IN THE CAR. GEORGE  It's a blue Honda... AMY  This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating.  ELAINE  Hi, I'm Elaine. JERRY  Jerry. AMY  Hello. ELAINE  It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.  AMY  I'm happy to do it. (TO GEORGE) I'm Amy.  GEORGE  Hi Amy, I'm George.  INT. PARKING GARAGE GEORGE  I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...  GEORGE  ...with that group. ELAINE  What about my fish? JERRY  Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.  ELAINE  I'll say.  THEY TURN TO GEORGE, WHO'S GAPING AT SOMETHING. ELAINE  What is it? ELAINE  The car! JERRY  The car! GEORGE  The car! ELAINE  We found it. I can't believe it! GEORGE  Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!  JERRY  Kramer!  INT. PARKING GARAGE - ONE HOUR LATER JERRY  Kramer. KRAMER  Jerry? JERRY  Yeah, over here. KRAMER  Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was? GEORGE Purple 23.  KRAMER  Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.  GEORGE  Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.  KRAMER  What time is it? GEORGE  Seven forty-five. KRAMER  Well at least there's no traffic. GEORGE  Right. KRAMER  What time does that play start? GEORGE  Eight o'clock. KRAMER  That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...   JERRY INDICATES HE SHOULDN'T PURSUE THAT. KRAMER  Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?  THE END>",

        "text": "   THE CAFE Written by Tom Leopold   (Comedy club)  There's always that one location, one store location that's constantly changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's a leather store, it's a yogurt shop, it's a pet supply. It's constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land in mother ship of close encounters, bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will come wondering out in a daze going 'I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you?.'   (George and Jerry are standing outside in the street. Across the street there is a restaurant called Dream Cafe. Sign says Grand opening.)  GEORGE  She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't like nice.  JERRY  This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.  GEORGE  Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?  JERRY  What's that smell? What are you wearing?  GEORGE  Little cologne. JERRY  Manly. GEORGE  Monica wants me to wear it. JERRY  So why didn't you say no? GEORGE  I'm too nice. JERRY  Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.  GEORGE  She wants me to take an IQ test. JERRY  That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.  GEORGE  No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig.  JERRY  I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.  GEORGE  You know, I can't talk to you anymore.  JERRY  All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.  GEORGE  Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.  JERRY  Who thinks you're smart? GEORGE  I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing.  JERRY  What thing? GEORGE  You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!  JERRY  Oh, the IQ thing...yeah. GEORGE  I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.  JERRY  What did you get? GEORGE  What did I get or what do I say I got?  JERRY  What do you say? GEORGE  I say fourteen o nine (1409). JERRY  1409, that's a good score. GEORGE  You're telling me. JERRY  What did you really get? GEORGE  You are my friend. JERRY  Of course. GEORGE  I tell you everything, right? JERRY  I hope so. GEORGE  Well, this I take to the grave.  (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching Dream Cafe with binoculars and Elaine is reading a newspaper.)  JERRY  He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one is going in.  ELAINE  Why do you keep watching? JERRY  I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going to make it, you kind of root it for awhile.  ELAINE  And then you flush. JERRY  Well, it's a spider. ELAINE  You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.   (Jerry pulls his sweater over his nose.) ELAINE  You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.  JERRY  Bazooka Joe.  (Buzzer rings and Jerry looks at Elaine who is closer to the door.)  JERRY  The buzzer. ELAINE  It's your house. JERRY  My house? You have to be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah?  INTERCOM  It's George. JERRY  Come on up. ELAINE  Casus belli. JERRY  What's that? ELAINE  It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.  JERRY  Go in, go in! ELAINE  Have you gone in there? JERRY  No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners with him.   (George enters. He's got some bagels and big SAT book.) GEORGE  Hi. JERRY  You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.   (Elaine sniffs around.) GEORGE  I'm wearing some cologne, all right?  ELAINE  Sure, fine. JERRY  Casus belli. ELAINE  Casus belli. GEORGE  What's that? ELAINE  Since when do you wear cologne? GEORGE  Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.  JERRY  Hey, how did you do on that IQ test?  GEORGE  I didn't take it yet. ELAINE  What IQ test? GEORGE  What's casus belli. JERRY  Oh, it's nothing... GEORGE  Is it about me? JERRY  Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't you just be? Why can't you live?  ELAINE  It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?  JERRY  This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for this course.  ELAINE  Oh, that sounds like fun. GEORGE  Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.  ELAINE  You'll do well, you're smart. JERRY  No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.  ELAINE  What did you get on your SAT's? GEORGE  It varies. JERRY  You know, I don't even know my IQ.  ELAINE  Mine's 145. GEORGE  145! JERRY  Get out of here! ELAINE  You get out of here! JERRY  You get out of here! GEORGE  You should take the test for me. JERRY  Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we do that again?  ELAINE  What? GEORGE  You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.  ELAINE  Are you serious? GEORGE  Why not? ELAINE  Where would I take the test? GEORGE  I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here or go to the coffee shop.  ELAINE  No, that would be too noisy. JERRY  Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.  ELAINE  Hey, what do you think? JERRY  Hey, I love a good caper. ELAINE  Yeah, that's what is is, a caper. GEORGE  You'll do it? ELAINE  What the hey. GEORGE  Yeaah, beautiful...(They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...   (Dream Cafe. Jerry comes in.) BABU BHATT  Welcome to the Dream Cafe. JERRY  Well, I've been looking forward to it.  BABU  Oh, how did you hear about us? JERRY  Eh, people, people are talking. BABU  Smoking or non smoking? We are proud to offer both.  JERRY  Non smoking would be great. BABU  Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot face cloth for your pleasure.  JERRY  Thank you. (Throws the towel around like a hot potato.)  BABU  Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.  JERRY  Well, what do you recommend my good fellow?  BABU  Oh, the turkey. JERRY  Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many years.  BABU  You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...  JERRY THINKS  Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people like I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a nobel price?   (George is taking a test at Monica's bedroom.) GEORGE  You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.  MONICA  But why? GEORGE  I can't concentrate in front of you.  MONICA  Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.  GEORGE  Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons intelligence.  MONICA  Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.  GEORGE  Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse me, I would like to get started please.  MONICA  Good luck. GEORGE  Don't need it.  (Monica leaves and George runs to the window where Elaine is waiting.)  ELAINE  What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 minutes.  GEORGE  I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this.  ELAINE  All right, what time do you want me back here.  GEORGE  Eh, twenty to three. ELAINE  Ok. GEORGE  Thanks again. ELAINE  All right. GEORGE  And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius.   (Jerry is eating at the Dream Cafe. Babu fills the water for Jerry.)  JERRY  Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.  BABU  It is in deed my pleasure. JERRY  Oh, please...  (Elaine comes in.) BABU  Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials today...  ELAINE  Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast.  BABU  Tea and toast. JERRY  Eat something! Babu... ELAINE  Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni. BABU  Oh, very good choice. Very good.  (Elaine is opening an envelope and is very excited.) JERRY  Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.  ELAINE  I know.  (Kramer comes in.) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...  ELAINE  Hey. KRAMER  This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.  JERRY  So? KRAMER  Well, I'm not giving it back. JERRY  Why not? KRAMER  Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him?   (Kramer takes some nachos and spills some to Elaine's test.)  KRAMER  Oh, gees... ELAINE  Yeah, ok...(takes the test and goes to another table.)  KRAMER  Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?  JERRY  Statute. KRAMER  What? JERRY  Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.  KRAMER  No, statue. JERRY  Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.  KRAMER  Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?  ELAINE  Statute. KRAMER  Oh, I really think you're wrong. ELAINE  Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long of time.  KRAMER  What test? ELAINE  An IQ test. KRAMER  Why do you take an IQ test? ELAINE  It's for George. KRAMER  George? ELAINE  Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later?  KRAMER  Why are you taking an IQ test for George?  ELAINE  Would you please?! KRAMER  What, is it for a job or something?  ELAINE  Later! KRAMER  You're positive it's statute? ELAINE  Yes, yes! BABU  Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face cloth...(gives Kramer a hot towel and Kramer screams and falls from his chair.)   (Monica's. George is reading a New Yorker on the bed and Monica is trying to get in. The door is locked.)  MONICA  George? GEORGE  Yeah? MONICA  The door is locked. GEORGE  Oh, it's locked? MONICA  I need to get something. GEORGE  Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer.  MONICA  George! GEORGE  Wish I could.  (Dream Cafe. Babu is singing and Elaine gets distracted.) BABU  Ladadeeda, laadadeeda.... ELAINE  Babu! If you don't mind?  (Babu comes to collect dishes from Elaine's table and knocks down a cup of coffee.)  ELAINE  Oh my God! It's all over the test!  BABU  Oh, I'm terribly sorry. ELAINE  Oh man! Look at this...and I'm late anyway.  BABU  Please, forgive me, please... JERRY  Go ahead, I'll take care of it. BABU  I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!  JERRY  It's all right, she was cheating anyway.  BABU  You're a very kind man. JERRY  Babu, you're Pakistani? BABU  Yes, Pakistani, yes. JERRY  Babu, may I say something? BABU  Of course, you're a very smart man, I'll listen.  JERRY  I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to franks and beans for example.  BABU  But there are no Pakistani people here.  JERRY  Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.  BABU  Yes, you see everything, don't you?  JERRY  Well, not everything. I do what I can.  BABU  I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you very much, you're very special person, very special.   (Babu leaves) JERRY THINKING  I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be?   (Elaine is giving the test back to George.) ELAINE  It was an accident. GEORGE  What did you go on a picnic? ELAINE  Babu Bhatt did it. GEORGE  Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?  MONICA  Time's up George. GEORGE  Ok. (George opens the door.) Here you go.  MONICA  How did you do? GEORGE  Piece of cake. MONICA  What happened to the test? GEORGE  What? I spilled some food on it. MONICA  Food? What food? GEORGE  What are you talking about? MONICA  Where did you get food? GEORGE  From my pocket. MONICA  What? GEORGE  I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.  MONICA  And coffee? GEORGE  Yeah, had some coffee, yeah. MONICA  Where did you get the coffee? GEORGE  Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, from the grocery store.  MONICA  How did you get there? GEORGE  I walked. MONICA  How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.  GEORGE  I climbed out the window. MONICA  You climbed out the window? GEORGE  Of course. MONICA  Why didn't you go out the door? GEORGE  The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here.  MONICA  You are a fascinating man, George Costanza.  Closed for renovation.) JERRY  Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.  ELAINE  You're very special.  (Kramer enters.) KRAMER  Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.  JERRY  Of course, I always do. KRAMER  No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.  ELAINE  Just give it back to him. KRAMER  Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)   (Jerry sees George from the window.) JERRY  Hey Georgie! GEORGE  Coming up. JERRY  How did you do on the IQ test?! GEORGE  85! JERRY  What?!! GEORGE  85, Jerry! 85 IQ !  (Jerry laughs.) ELAINE  85? JERRY  Well, well, well... ELAINE  He's coming up? JERRY  Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.  ELAINE  Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous.  JERRY  Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions about hunting and testicles...   (George comes in looking angry.) GEORGE  Oh, hello professor. ELAINE  George, I cannot believe... GEORGE  Please... ELAINE  No there has got be a mistake. GEORGE  You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.  JERRY  But an 85? ELAINE  There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.  JERRY MOCKING  It was a madhouse. ELAINE  Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.  GEORGE  Whow, forget it. ELAINE  Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?  GEORGE  You could do worst! ELAINE  No, no, I guarantee it. GEORGE  All right, I'll ask her. ELAINE  Ok, now where I'm going to take it.  JERRY  Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.   (Dream Cafe. Babu is on the window looking gloomy. Jerry comes in.)  JERRY  Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.  BABU  You see how I listened. I worked very hard, borrowed more money.  JERRY  I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.  BABU  You wish to eat? JERRY  Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen and tell your chef I want the works.  BABU  Very good. JERRY THINKING  Very good? No, not very good, very great. I am very, very great.   (Jerry's apartment. Elaine is finishing the test.)  (Monica's bedroom. George is pacing the room.)  (Jerry's monologue.)  You know the IQ test has always that sample question at the beginning where they show how to fill in the circle. It should be the first eliminating point right there. Anybody goes outside of that circle, yeah you wanna come with us, yeah you're done, the test is over, you went outside the circle ok?   (Jerry's apartment. Elaine finishes the test and is packing the stuff.)   (Kramer charges in and locks the door behind him.) ELAINE  What are you doing? KRAMER  Quiet. Shh, don't say anything. ELAINE  What's going on? MAN BEHIND THE DOOR  Hey, Kramer! I saw you going there! I'm not leaving until I get the jacket. (Bangs on the door) Open up Kramer!  ELAINE  Why did you come in here for? KRAMER  I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.  ELAINE  Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.  KRAMER  I thought you took the test. ELAINE  I had to take it again. KRAMER  How come? ELAINE  What's the difference?!! KRAMER  Well, you can't leave now. ELAINE  What? MAN BEHIND THE DOOR  Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back!  KRAMER  Never!  (Monica's apartment. George is looking out the window.) MONICA  George, open up.  (George opens the door.) MONICA  Well?  (George shakes her hand.) GEORGE  How' you doing? MONICA  Where's the test? GEORGE  You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to get a cup of coffee...   (Dream Cafe. Babu is looking as Jerry eats.) JERRY  Babu? Babu...(waves Babu to come to table) Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?  BABU  The shrimp is stringy? JERRY  Well, maybe your refrigerator... BABU  Quiet!! You shut up! You make me change restaurant, but nobody comes! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people!  JERRY  You know, I think I'll just take the check.  BABU  You bad man! You very very bad man! (leaves)  JERRY THINKING  Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?   (Monica's. Elaine is gently tapping on the bedroom window. Monica comes to open.)  MONICA  Are you looking for George? ELAINE  Well eh, kind of.... MONICA  George left. ELAINE  Oh. MONICA  Is that the test? ELAINE  Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.  MONICA  Thanks. I hope you did do a lot better this time.  ELAINE  Actually, you know what, I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...(Monica closes the window)...entreat.   (At the street. Dream Cafe has a Closed sign on the window and men are carrying furniture out.) (George, Jerry and Kramer are standing across the street. Kramer has no jacket on.)  JERRY  You know what it was, bad location.  GEORGE  Lets not stand here, we might run in to her.  JERRY  Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?  KRAMER  Yeah... JERRY  Oh, I'm sorry. KRAMER  I'm going upstairs.  (Elaine comes.) ELAINE  Hey guys, I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.  JERRY  151? GEORGE  That's a good score. JERRY  So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?  GEORGE  Italian. ELAINE  No, Chinese. JERRY  You know, what would be great?  (George and Elaine give Jerry a long look.)  (Comedy club)  It's tough to do a good deed. Just look at your professional good deed doers. Your lone rangers, your superman, your Batman, your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They are all wearing disguises, masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. \"Superman, thanks for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? I'm renting here, I've got a security deposit. What am I supposed to do?\"     THE END>",

What the hell is he doing, he can't be down there on the floor with you and me? Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear physicists, we're all on the same level. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. \"Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills. Spread out, give me some room.\" The only hard part of his whole job that I could see is typing everything onto that little tiny label. He has to try and get all the words on there, keep the paper in the- it's a little piece of paper, in the roller of the typewriter. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. \"Yeah, I'd like to get this prescription filled.\" \"Alright, and you wait down there, only I'm allowed up here.\"  First scene.  Jerry and George are at a newsstand. GEORGE  Where'd you meet her? JERRY  I met her on an elevator. GEORGE  On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?  JERRY  Impossible, right? GEORGE  You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb.   What got into you? JERRY  I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The   words just came out of my mouth. GEORGE  Wow. What'd you say?  (flashback to Jerry and Isabel on the elevator) JERRY  You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.   (end of flashback) GEORGE  Wow. JERRY  Can you believe I did that? GEORGE  What did she say?  (another flashback) ISABEL  What crop circles?  (end of flashback) JERRY  Not a good sign. GEORGE  Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand   owner) Do you know what the crop circles are? NEWSSTAND OWNER  Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?  JERRY  You got something in your teeth there.  GEORGE  What? JERRY  It's green. GEORGE  Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all   afternoon. JERRY  Did you bump into anybody you knew?  GEORGE  I had a job interview. JERRY  How'd it go? GEORGE  Take a guess.  (flashback to George's job interview, with close-ups of George's spinached   teeth.) INTERVIEWER  Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time,   but should anything open up, we'll be in touch. GEORGE  Ok, thanks.  (end of flashback) JERRY  What do you need a job, you got Audrey.  GEORGE  Yeah, right. JERRY  What's the matter? GEORGE  Oh, nothing. JERRY  What? GEORGE  You won't think I'm a bad person? JERRY  Too late for that. GEORGE  'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a   psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big. JERRY  Yeah, she's got a big nose. GEORGE  I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.   (momentary flashback to Audrey's tremendous nose) JERRY  It's a schnoz. GEORGE  Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little   short of perfection. JERRY  A little. GEORGE  So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be   grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have   to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't   ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell   myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I   look at her, I see nose. JERRY  Stop being so concerned with looks.   (momentary flashback to Isabel giving Jerry her number) JERRY  Have you said anything to her about it?  GEORGE  I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a   smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be   out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And   I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose. JERRY  Alright, shut up, here they come. GEORGE  How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.   New scene.  Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's   apartment. KRAMER  So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house   so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he   takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So   Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that   you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.  ELAINE  Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?  KRAMER  No no, he's never met her. She's in California.  ELAINE  Are you coming with me? KRAMER  Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, Peter Von Nostrand.  GEORGE  Why don't you just commit yourself already?  AUDREY  What is so special about this jacket?  ELAINE  He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.  AUDREY  What's the smudge on your hand? KRAMER  Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going   back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.  GEORGE  What, you didn't wash all day? KRAMER  Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at   this club. Ohh, man. AUDREY  It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually   find it kind of intimidating. KRAMER  Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.  ELAINE  Kramer! KRAMER  What? What? ELAINE  How could you say something like that?!  KRAMER  What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.  ELAINE  No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.  AUDREY  No, it's ok. ELAINE  What did you have to say that for?  KRAMER  Well, I was just trying to help out.  ELAINE  Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.  KRAMER  You see what happens when you try to be nice?   Mid-episode monologue.  But what would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking, all   the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date last? About   thirteen seconds, I think. \"Oh, sorry. Your rear end is too big.\" \"That's ok,   your breath stinks anyway. See you later, no problem, good-bye, ok, thank you   very much.\"  New scene.  George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment. AUDREY  Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back.   What are you thinking about? GEORGE  Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?  AUDREY  You look like you've got something on your mind.  GEORGE  Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause)   So how about that Kramer, huh? AUDREY  How about him? GEORGE  They way he just says stuff. AUDREY  He sure does. GEORGE  Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.  AUDREY  So, what did you think? GEORGE  About the pizza? AUDREY  No, about the nose job. GEORGE  Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?  AUDREY  Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.  GEORGE  Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but   these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined.   And again, I'm not suggesting. AUDREY  I know, they're good. GEORGE  Peter Jennings had one. AUDREY  Really? GEORGE  Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class   had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so... AUDREY  Uh huh. GEORGE  It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.  AUDREY  I hate the dentist. GEORGE  It's a cleaning. AUDREY  So you really think I should do this?  GEORGE  If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you  THIS  Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone   it, but it's a fact of life. AUDREY  Well, maybe I should. GEORGE  What the hell. ELAINE  Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?  GEORGE  Me? I didn't say anything. ELAINE  You encouraged her to get one. GEORGE  I didn't encourage. No encourage. ELAINE  Peter Jennings had one? GEORGE  It's possible. ELAINE  Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.  AUDREY  No, George is right. I want to get one.  ELAINE  I think it's a mistake. GEORGE  Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.   New scene.  Jerry and George are at the coffee shop. GEORGE  I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.  JERRY  Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.  GEORGE  Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the   bandages off at four o'clock. JERRY  We have time. GEORGE  It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.  JERRY  It is exciting. GEORGE  Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...  JERRY  Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever   met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so   attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my   penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win. GEORGE  You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.  JERRY  Then what? GEORGE  He still wins but it's not a blowout.  JERRY  She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting   scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless,   I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.   (flashback to Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment) JERRY  I don't want to see this woman anymore but   I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help   me. KRAMER  I'm proud of you.  (end of flashback) JERRY  So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.  GEORGE  Good for you. JERRY  I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was   just completely uninhibited. GEORGE  It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not   caring. JERRY  It's not like that at all.  New scene.  Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment.  ELAINE  How do you even know the jacket is there?  KRAMER  Well I don't, I'm guessing. GEORGE  Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that   I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna   be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd   listened to your friend, Elaine, AUDREY  George? GEORGE  Yeah? AUDREY  Enough. JERRY  Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.  ELAINE  Are you sure you want us here for this?  AUDREY  Yes. JERRY  Shouldn't a doctor do it? AUDREY  No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.  GEORGE  Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.   Audrey removed the bandage, the gang tries to disguise their horror.  ELAINE  It looks good. JERRY  Great job. KRAMER  You got butchered.  George faints.  An undetermined time later, Jerry and Elaine are helping George to his feet.  JERRY  Let's put him over here. KRAMER  Where are you going? AUDREY  To the doctor! KRAMER  Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.   Kramer leaves, Elaine sits on the couch near George. ELAINE  How ya feeling? GEORGE  Too much salt in my diet. ELAINE  Can I get you anything? GEORGE  Nah, I'm good. ELAINE  You sure? Anything? GEORGE  Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?  ELAINE  No, it didn't. No, it didn't. GEORGE  It's like, all dented. ELAINE  Seems to be. GEORGE  Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern   science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be   stopped, no way, no how, science just marches-- ELAINE  Shut up, George. GEORGE  Shut up? ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  Interesting.  New scene.  Jerry and Kramer are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer is pouring a bowl of cereal,   Jerry has cracked. JERRY  Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!  KRAMER  I don't have it, I threw it out. JERRY  You're lying! You got it, I want that number!  KRAMER  I told you, I threw it out. JERRY  Give it to me! KRAMER  You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.  JERRY  Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.  KRAMER  You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.  JERRY  I was lying, give it to me! KRAMER  No, you told me not to! JERRY  I want that number! KRAMER  Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah!   Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you!   Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror,   cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it   anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you   destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!  Kramer storms out, then storms back in to grab the box of cereal and the bowl,   then storms out again.  New scene.  George and Audrey are at the coffee shop, Audrey is talking about her nose,   George is trying not to look at it. AUDREY  The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum.   Over here... GEORGE  Yeah. AUDREY  You see this perinasal sinus cavity?  GEORGE  Oh, I got it. AUDREY  You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.  GEORGE  Yeah, phew. AUDREY  So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?  GEORGE  What? AUDREY  Remember we talked about taking a trip together?  GEORGE  We did? AUDREY  Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?  GEORGE  Hawaii? AUDREY  Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.   George (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right   now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's   a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.  AUDREY  I never heard that. GEORGE  Oh yeah. My friend lived there. AUDREY  We could go to the Caribbean. GEORGE  You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane   right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he   used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there,   uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you   from going. You could go. I don't mind. AUDREY  George, I don't think this is working.   New scene.  Jerry is rehearsing with Isabel. ISABEL  Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear   Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore. JERRY  I'm Nelson! ISABEL  That's not the line, Jerry. JERRY  Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just   need more time. ISABEL  I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go   crazy thinking about you. JERRY  Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.  ISABEL  Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.  JERRY  Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.   Cut to the table where a slightly translucent Jerry's brain is playing chess   with a similarly visible Jerry's penis. JERRY'S BRAIN  Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we   play one for all the marbles? JERRY'S PENIS  Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have   any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it! JERRY'S BRAIN  I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little   acting scenes. JERRY'S PENIS  Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up   with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour,   then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.  JERRY'S BRAIN  What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's   like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do   whatever it is you do. You disgust me. JERRY'S PENIS  Oh, go read a book. JERRY'S BRAIN  Enough chatting, let's play.  New scene.  Elaine and Kramer are outside the landlord's apartment. ELAINE  You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to   the hospital. KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got   everything? ELAINE  Yeah. KRAMER  Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.  ELAINE  What do I need this for? KRAMER  Because we're engaged. ELAINE  We're engaged? KRAMER  Um hm. ELAINE  Kramer, this is too big. KRAMER  It's my mom's.  A stout man walks around the corner. LANDLORD  Hello? ELAINE  Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father   asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him. LANDLORD  Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And   you must be Professor Von Nostrand? KRAMER  Yes, yes I am. LANDLORD  I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.  KRAMER  Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.  LANDLORD  Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?  KRAMER  My contention? LANDLORD  Yes, your contention. KRAMER  Yes, that's my contention. ELAINE  I heard him contend that. LANDLORD  It's too bad about your father. ELAINE  Oh, it was a frame-up. LANDLORD  A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work   you're doing. ELAINE  Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.  KRAMER  She does fine work. LANDLORD  Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to   anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this   way. ELAINE  How kind of you. LANDLORD  You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.   Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.   New scene.  Jerry's Brain and Penis are still playing chess, Jerry's Brain appears to have   the upper hand. JERRY'S BRAIN  What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha   ha! ISABEL  Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of   you. JERRY'S PENIS  It's killing me. (Makes a move) JERRY'S BRAIN  That's your move? JERRY'S PENIS  Yeah. JERRY'S BRAIN  Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!  JERRY'S PENIS  Getting weak... Losing  power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing   without me. Nothing!  Jerry's Penis disappears with an audible pop. JERRY'S BRAIN  Punk. JERRY  Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.   Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face.  Back to Elaine, Kramer and the landlord at Albert Pepper's apartment.  ELAINE  Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.  LANDLORD  He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite   popular with the ladies. ELAINE  My father, really? I had no idea. LANDLORD  Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came   around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been   your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs   Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the street, drunken   stumblebum. KRAMER  You don't say? ELAINE  I found it! LANDLORD  The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a   can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees,   screaming down the hall, \"Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring   back that box of Danish!\"  Throughout the landlord's narrative, Kramer becomes more and more agitated.   Finally, he grabs the pipe out of his mouth.  New scene.  The four are at their usual booth at the coffee shop. KRAMER  So I grabbed the guy by the collar.  ELAINE  Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!\"  JERRY  So I assume the jig was up. ELAINE  Yeah, pretty much.  Kramer shows off the fruits of their labor; he's wearing the jacket. Audrey   walks in, her nose has been repaired and she's absolutely beautiful.  AUDREY  Hi. ELAINE  Hi! JERRY  Hey. AUDREY  Hello. GEORGE  Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!  AUDREY  Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.  ELAINE  So, will I see you later tonight? AUDREY  Not sure. KRAMER  Well, I'll check  you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready? AUDREY  I didn't wash. KRAMER  Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.  ELAINE  Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect   proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have   though she's like-- GEORGE  Elaine. Shut up.  (Comedy club)  The technical term for a nose job is rhinoplasty. Rhino, okay? Do we really need to insult the person at this particular moment of their lives? They know they have a big nose, that's why they're coming in. Do they really need the abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything else? When someone goes in for a hair transplant, they don't go, \"We're going to perform a cue-ballectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We're going to attempt to remove the skinheadia of your chrome-domus which is the technical term.\"      THE END>",

        "text": "    THE STRANDED Written by   Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld &amp; Matt Goldman   (Comedy club)  So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication.  You ever try and pick one of these out?  It's not easy.  It's a wall.  It's an entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, \"Alright, alright, alright, okay, what the hell--  This is quick acting, but this is long lasting.  When do I need to feel good, now or later?\"  It's a tough question. And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong with the guy, you know?  They always show you, like, all the problems that he's having.  First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this guy.  No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public.  And he's always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him. I never had a doctor say to me, \"Are you having any pain?\"  \"Yes I am.\"  \"Are you having any lightning with the pain?\"  First scene.  Jerry and George are in a drug store. JERRY  How did you get fleas? GEORGE  Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet. JERRY  Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.  GEORGE  That's not funny.  So, are you coming to the party?  JERRY  I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The   whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, \"You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?\" GEORGE  You know Ava's gonna be there. JERRY  Who? GEORGE  The nice one that works in my office.  JERRY  Nah. GEORGE  I'll drive. JERRY  Oh, well, now you're talking. GEORGE  It's supposed to be a good party. JERRY  What does that mean, good dip? GEORGE  No, there'll be girls there. JERRY  There's girls everywhere.  I go out of my apartment, there's girls in   the elevator.  They're in cafeterias, subways, so what? GEORGE  There's a hundred different things here.  What's the difference between these two?  (They each grab a box and check the ingredients)  You got propylparabin? JERRY  Got it. GEORGE  You got isobutane-30? JERRY  I got isobutane-20. GEORGE  A-ha. JERRY  You got  sorbitant sesquioliate? GEORGE  Got it. JERRY  I have aloe! GEORGE  You got aloe?  I love aloe. JERRY  Where do they make yours? GEORGE  Jersey. JERRY  White Plains.  George puts down the \"Jersey\" box and grabs the \"White Plains\" box from Jerry and they go to the check out counter.  Two women are standing at the magazine rack in the background. JERRY  Girls.  There's girls right here in the store.  Look, look, there's one   over there.  Look, there's another one.  Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there.  What's the matter? GEORGE  I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.  JERRY  Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.  GEORGE  Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten. CASHIER  You gave me a ten. GEORGE  I'm positive I gave you a twenty. CASHIER  I know what you gave me. GEORGE  You owe me ten dollars. CASHIER  Will you please step aside?  Next?  GEORGE  Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you-- CASHIER  You. GEORGE  No, no, no, see you're not really listening.  SECURITY GUARD  What's the problem here? GEORGE  No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's all. CASHIER  He's claiming short. SECURITY GUARD  Alright, let's just take it outside.  GEORGE  Oh, so you don't believe me either?  SECURITY GUARD  Come on, let's go. GEORGE  You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting what's happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back.  Alright, don't worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be back.   New scene.  George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door .  ELAINE  Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.  JERRY  No, let's survey first.  Camp here.  GEORGE  Eva.  A beautiful woman starts walking over. JERRY  What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of   strangers treat your house like a hotel room. AVA  So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.  GEORGE  Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when? AVA  Yesterday GEORGE  I don't believe it. AVA  Ask Mark. GEORGE  Mark, is this true?  A man across the room nods.  George and Ava walk towards him.  JERRY  Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.  ELAINE  How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind. JERRY  Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us   gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it. ELAINE  How old are you? JERRY  Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no, no, I got a better one.  Head patting. ELAINE  Whatever you want.  Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.  GUY  You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?  JERRY  Yeah, yeah I did. GUY  So what do you do? JERRY  I'm a comedian. GUY  Are you?  Lemme ask you something.  Where do you get your material?  JERRY  I hear a voice. GUY  What kind of voice? JERRY  A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.  GUY  How come you keep tapping your head.  JERRY  It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.   Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.  GUY  On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.  The man   devoted his whole life to the peanut.  Imagine having so much passion for something.  Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'. GUY  Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.   Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'.  She's still tapping madly.  GUY  I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.  ELAINE  Yeah, me too. GUY  Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.   Cut to George, now talking with Jerry. GEORGE  How's it going? JERRY  Great, how about you? GEORGE  I can't believe what's happening here.  She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.  JERRY  How do you account for this? GEORGE  I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.  JERRY  Well, she obviously liked you all along.  GEORGE  No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes   me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, \"Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him.\" JERRY  Anyway, I'm ready to go. GEORGE  Now? JERRY  If not now, when? GEORGE  Gimme a half-hour. JERRY  Okay, half-hour.  Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'.  By now, she's weary from tapping.  GUY  Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...  JERRY  Can I talk to you for a second? ELAINE  Oh, excuse me.  (gets up to talk with Jerry)  What have you been doing,   I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental patient.  JERRY  Hey, I was dying over there. ELAINE  This guy's going off on the peanut.  Now pay attention.   Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry. ELLEN  Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.  You talk about a lot of every day things, right? JERRY  Right. ELLEN  Yeah, I remember you.  Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting on the couch near a pretentious woman. WOMAN  I wonder what happened to my fiancé.  I know he's here somewhere. Ellen?  Have you seen my fiancé? ELLEN  He's upstairs. WOMAN  Are you going upstairs?  Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.  I have lost my fiancé, the poor baby. ELAINE  Maybe the dingo ate your baby. WOMAN  What? ELAINE  The dingo ate your baby!  Cut to George and Jerry. JERRY  You ready? GEORGE  Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.  JERRY  I do favors. GEORGE  I think something's happening here.  JERRY  What? GEORGE  I think she wants me to take her home.  JERRY  Wow. GEORGE  What should I do? JERRY  Go!  What could you do? GEORGE  What about you and Elaine? JERRY  We'll get a ride. GEORGE  Are you sure? JERRY  We'll be fine, what did she say? GEORGE  She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes)  She told me she wants me to make love to her. JERRY  What?  She said that? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Get out of here. GEORGE  I swear. JERRY  What did you say? GEORGE  I, I, I can't. JERRY  What did you say? GEORGE  Please, it's-- JERRY  What? GEORGE  I... I... I long for you. JERRY  I long for you? GEORGE  I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.  JERRY  It's okay, that's not bad. GEORGE  I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.  JERRY  Really? GEORGE  That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus?   What if I can't deliver? JERRY  Oh, come on. GEORGE  I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this. JERRY  George, you're thinking too much. GEORGE  I know, I know, I can't stop it!  Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch. ELAINE  Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.  JERRY  Pendant?  Those bastards. ELAINE  Excuse me. JERRY  Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office  ELAINE  Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we can go now?  JERRY  Uh, no, he's taking the car. ELAINE  Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?  JERRY  I don't know. ELAINE  You don't know? JERRY  Maybe Kramer can come pick us up. ELAINE  Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?  JERRY  There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.   Mid-episode monologue  All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.  This is the male code.  And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch pad.  They hold that countdown.  He's leaning against the rocket talking to her, \"So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?\"  ELAINE  Oh look at that.  Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing? JERRY  Yeah, yeah, alright. ELAINE  I can't believe she's walking around in that.  JERRY  Just don't make a scene. ELAINE  Hey, is that real fur? JERRY  Oh boy. EVA  It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.  GEORGE  Yeah, good night. ELAINE  You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good? GEORGE  Could we talk about this some other time?  AVA  Are you a vegetarian? JERRY  Here we go. ELAINE  Yeah, I eat fish occasionally. AVA  So you're a hypocrite. GEORGE  Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.  Anyway-  AVA  Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.  ELAINE  Fish don't feel any pain. AVA  How do you know?  Do you communicate with fish?  ELAINE  Well, they're not kept in little cages.  AVA  Ever seen a goldfish? GEORGE  Goldfish. ELAINE  Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're not unhappy.  AVA  Oh yeah, right.  Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down   the toilet, that's a good life.  (To George)  Let's go. ELAINE  Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel! GEORGE  That's why we're here in America. JERRY  You're beautiful. ELAINE  Call Kramer. JERRY  Alright. (Approaches host)  Excuse me, this is your party, right?  STEVE  No, I just live here. JERRY  Can I use your phone? STEVE  What's in it for me? JERRY  A bigger bill? STEVE  He he, go for it.  Jerry picks up the phone and dials. JERRY  Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island.  What are your thoughts about taking a ride?  You sure?  Okay, but don't leave me hanging here.  Okay, great.  Let me give you directions.   Cut to several hours later.  The party has ended.  The hosts, Steve and Jenny, are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there. ELAINE  You sure you don't need any help? JENNY  No, not really. JERRY  I'm sure he'll be here any minute.  JENNY  I want them out of here. ELAINE  Call him again. JERRY  I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.  JENNY  It's two o'clock in the morning. JERRY  Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw   some of that show, it was wonderful. ELAINE  Six hundred and twenty million people died.  JERRY  Thousand. ELAINE  Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand.  The horror, the horror. (To Jerry)  The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.  Are you sure you gave him the right directions? JERRY  Yes.  (To Jenny)  You're sure there's nothing we can do?  JENNY  No!  (To Steve)  I am not going to bed with them in out house, this is ridiculous. JERRY  You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.  Mike Wichter.  He sold plastic straws.  You know the ones?  You could bend them.  ELAINE  Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason. JENNY  You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.  JERRY  Oh, he's coming. JENNY  Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.   Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.  JERRY  That's him. JENNY  I'm going to bed! ELAINE  Thanks a lot. JERRY  Thanks, great party.  As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve answers.  KRAMER  Hey, how ya doing? STEVE  Ah, look who's here. KRAMER  I'm sorry. JERRY  Hey, it's okay. KRAMER  I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window. ELAINE  Then how did you find the place? KRAMER  Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.  Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it.  8173. JERRY  Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you   one. STEVE  No problem. JERRY  And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy   club, whatever. STEVE  Hey, I might take you up on that. JERRY  Here's my address and number.  And really, thanks again.  KRAMER  You better zip up.  I couldn't get the top on the convertible up. ELAINE  But it's cold out. KRAMER  Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.   New scene.  Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone. JERRY  George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine was too.  Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.  Do the math.  Yeah, maybe I will get out.  Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first.  Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.  Yeah, Selwyn's.  Okay bye.   Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the door.  JERRY  Who is it? VOICE  Mr. Pocatello. JERRY  Who? VOICE  You mean you don't recognize my voice?   Jerry opens the door.  Steve steps in. STEVE  Jerry, baby! JERRY  Do I know you? STEVE  Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.  JERRY  I'm sorry, uh- STEVE  See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.  JERRY  Oh, okay. STEVE  You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.  JERRY  You certainly are.  What's going on?  STEVE  I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until   eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break.  I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business. JERRY  Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.  STEVE  Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.  JERRY  No, really, I just got off the phone with him.  STEVE  I understand. JERRY  Look, you can hang out here if you want.  STEVE  Don't be so enthusiastic. JERRY  No, it's- STEVE  I'm not gonna steal anything. JERRY  No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.  STEVE  I think I can do that. JERRY  Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.  STEVE  Yeah.  Let's have lunch.  New scene.  Jerry and George are at the drug store. JERRY  They guy's in my house right now.  What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone. GEORGE  Yeah, me either. JERRY  Oh, come on. GEORGE  What come on?  Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?  JERRY  I've never had a job. GEORGE  You know the anxiety you feel on a date?  That's what I have every day now.  My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date. JERRY  That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?  GEORGE  Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend.  Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there again.' JERRY  What are you gonna do? GEORGE  I have no choice, I'm quitting.  Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV.  Kramer walks in and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor. KRAMER  The party, Long Island? STEVE  Kramer, right? KRAMER  Hey, what are you doing here? STEVE  I'm waiting for my ride. KRAMER  Where's Jerry? STEVE  He split.  Let me ask you something.  Is there anything to drink in here   or is that, like, a stupid question? KRAMER  Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.  (Sensing Steve's disappointment)  Well, but I might have something.  Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore.  Jerry is selecting medication.  JERRY  Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks good.  GEORGE  How much is that? JERRY  Nine sixty. GEORGE  Nine sixty?  Give it to me. JERRY  Why? GEORGE  Don't worry, I got it. JERRY  What do you mean, you got it? GEORGE  I got it.  George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket. JERRY  Since when are you treating me to medicine?  What are you doing?  You're stealing this, aren't you? GEORGE  I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten dollars.  They stole from me.  JERRY  You're a lunatic. GEORGE  I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.  JERRY  What do you say to a person like you?  GEORGE  Just walk. JERRY  Oh.  A security guard approaches George. SECURITY GUARD  Scuse me.  What do you got there? GEORGE  What? SECURITY GUARD  What do you got in your shirt? GEORGE  Oh, I was gonna pay for this. SECURITY GUARD  Come with me. GEORGE  Where are you taking me?  I was gonna pay for it.  CASHIER  um-hmm. SECURITY GUARD  You don't think I remember you? GEORGE  What are you talking about? SECURITY GUARD  I know who you are, I was watching you.  GEORGE  What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna call the police?   The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.  JERRY  Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?   Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked.  Kramer is in the middle of a story. KRAMER  So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the   top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown!  Well I followed the instructions!  They both erupt in raucous laughter. STEVE  Ah, they turned brown!!  Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?  KRAMER  Not really. STEVE  Maybe we should call one of those escort services.  I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.  Kramer (handing Steve the phone)  555-LOVE. STEVE  Hey, you want in on this? KRAMER  No, I got a girl in the next building   New scene.  Jerry is outside his apartment door, as he puts in the key, he hears a woman's voice from inside. VOICE  Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it.  Now I am through playing games with you, I got things to do. STEVE  Oh Jerry!  Jerry!  Look who's here, it's Jerry  JERRY  What the hell? STEVE  Jerry, this is Patti. JERRY  Nice to meet you. PATTI  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.  JERRY  What the hell is going on here? STEVE  I don't know, but I gotta do this more often.  (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally. PATTI  I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.  STEVE  See ya, Jerr.  And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.  JERRY  Oh, Kramer huh? STEVE  Yeah, he's a hoot.  Oh, goodbye, my dear.  (trying to kiss Patti's hand   as she pulls it away)  Ouch.  (To Jerry)  Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.  Steve walks out, leaving the front door open. PATTI  I ain't leaving. JERRY  Patti? PATTI  You got anything to drink? JERRY  Alright, how much does he owe you?  PATTI  Fifty dollars. JERRY  Fifty dollars.  In mid-payment, a police officer walks through the open door.  COP  This your apartment? JERRY  Yeah, but-- COP  You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.  JERRY  Wait a second, I--  Elaine walks in. ELAINE  I brought you chicken soup.  (To Patti)  Is that real fur?  JERRY  Oh boy.  New scene.  Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment, watching TV and eating pizza.  GEORGE  You had Sgt. Chadway?  Me too. JERRY  He was a nice guy. GEORGE  Oh, great guy. JERRY  Was there a red-headed guy there? GEORGE  The one with the long sideburns? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Where does he come off? JERRY  Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that kind of attitude.  GEORGE  One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.  JERRY  Oh, we all hated him.  (Comedy club)  There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor.  You can measure the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to 'do me a favor.'  Small favor, small pause.  Can you do me a favor, hand me that pencil?  No pause at all.  Big favors are, 'Could you do me a favor...' (huge pause, followed by closing credits.)     THE END>",

        "text": "  THE ALTERNATE SIDE Written by      Larry David &amp; Bill Masters   (Comedy club)  Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the car will behave as if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone disturbs it, it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. Not everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't it be nice if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? You know, somebody tries to break in, it goes, \"Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?\" I would like a car alarm like that.  First scene.  Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment. JERRY  Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.  GEORGE  Was the alarm on? JERRY  I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son. GEORGE  I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?  JERRY  They cross the wires or something.  GEORGE  Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.   Kramer enters. JERRY  They stole my car. KRAMER  Who did? JERRY  They did. KRAMER  Was it more than just one? JERRY  What should I do, should I call the police?  KRAMER  What are they gonna do? JERRY  I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.  GEORGE  Maybe you should call your car phone.  JERRY  Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.  GEORGE  Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.  JERRY  Are you serious? GEORGE  Yeah, go ahead, call. JERRY  I don't even know if I remember the number.   Jerry dials. JERRY  What do I say if he picks up? CAR THIEF  Hello? JERRY  Hello? Is this 555-8383? CAR THIEF  I have no idea. JERRY  Can I ask you a question? CAR THIEF  Sure. JERRY  Did you steal my car? CAR THIEF  Yes I did. JERRY  You did?! CAR THIEF  I did. JERRY  That's my car! CAR THIEF  I didn't know it was yours. JERRY  What are you gonna do with it? CAR THIEF  I dunno, drive around. JERRY  Then can I have it back? CAR THIEF  Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it.  Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone. KRAMER  Hello? CAR THIEF  Yeah, who's this? KRAMER  Kramer. CAR THIEF  Hello, Kramer. KRAMER  Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.  CAR THIEF  Wait, hold on... Brown ones? KRAMER  Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St. CAR THIEF  One-two-nine, okay. KRAMER  Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry. JERRY  Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello? CAR THIEF  Jerry? JERRY  Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?  CAR THIEF  I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.  JERRY  Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.  CAR THIEF  Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the--  Jerry hangs up. JERRY  Sid left the keys in the car. GEORGE  Who's Sid? JERRY  He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.  GEORGE  What do you mean? JERRY  He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket. GEORGE  What, do you pay him for that? JERRY  Yeah, like fifty bucks a month. GEORGE  How many people does he do that for?  JERRY  The whole block, forty, fifty cars.  KRAMER  He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been   doing that for years, right Jerry? GEORGE  Could anybody do that?  Sid enters. JERRY  Hey Sid, what happened? SID  I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.  JERRY  You left the keys in the car? SID  Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all   those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted. KRAMER  You know I'm in that movie? GEORGE  You are? KRAMER  Yeah, I'm an extra. GEORGE  How'd you get that? KRAMER  Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked   me. GEORGE  Right out of the clear blue sky? KRAMER  Clear blue sky! GEORGE  Well, why didn't they ask me? KRAMER  I got a quality. SID  Jerry, you got insurance, right? JERRY  Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.  SID  Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a   week, so I can't park it. JERRY  This Wednesday? SID  No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.  JERRY  But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.  SID  If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday. GEORGE  Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?  SID  Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move   themselves if they want. GEORGE  Maybe I could move them until you get back.  SID  What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?  GEORGE  I'm in a transition phase right now.  SID  Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all.  Phone rings. JERRY  Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.  New scene.  Jerry and Elaine are in line at the rental car agency. ELAINE  I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading   from one of his novels. JERRY  Owen March, I never heard of him. ELAINE  Well, he's not a baseball player. JERRY  Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.  ELAINE  Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.  JERRY  What's that? ELAINE  He's sixty-six years old. RENTAL CAR AGENT  Next please. ELAINE  Well, go, go. AGENT  Can I help you? Name please? JERRY  Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course. AGENT  Okay, let's see here. JERRY  Sixty-six years old? ELAINE  Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd   really like him. JERRY  Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?  ELAINE  What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?  JERRY  Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant,   she'd be spinning. AGENT  I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.  JERRY  I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?  AGENT  Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.  JERRY  But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation. AGENT  I know why we have reservations. JERRY  I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them. AGENT  Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.   The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she can be seen speaking with someone. JERRY  Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?  ELAINE  What? JERRY  Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking   to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.  ELAINE  Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm   not really saying anything at all? JERRY  Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought   I was checking with you. ELAINE  Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.   The agent returns. AGENT  I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.  JERRY  Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.  AGENT  But we do have a compact if you would like that.  JERRY  Fine. AGENT  Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance? JERRY  Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car. AGENT  Please fill this out. ELAINE  What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?  JERRY  Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.  ELAINE  I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.  New scene.  Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  I just don't enjoy being with him.  JERRY  Well that's what's important. ELAINE  I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?  JERRY  How many times you been out with him?  ELAINE  Seven? JERRY  Face to face. ELAINE  Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?  JERRY  If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex. ELAINE  Hmm... How's the pasta over there?   Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him out of the way and heads for the kitchen sink. KRAMER  Whoa, whoa!! JERRY  What is going on out there? GEORGE  I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm   that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!  George runs off into the bathroom. KRAMER  Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?  ELAINE  Today?! KRAMER  You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries. ELAINE  Yeah. KRAMER  So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing. ELAINE  He was laughing?! KRAMER  Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.  JERRY  So then what? KRAMER  I got a line in the movie! ELAINE  Get out! JERRY  That's great! GEORGE  You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?  KRAMER  Pretty good, huh? GEORGE  You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?  KRAMER  Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh? JERRY  You mean *a* career. ELAINE  So was Mia Farrow there? KRAMER  Uh, I didn't see him. ELAINE  What's your line? KRAMER  Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?   The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue. KRAMER  So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, \"Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.\" GEORGE  Is that how you're gonna say it? KRAMER  No, no, I'm working on it. ELAINE  Do it like this. \"These pretzels are making me thirsty.\"  JERRY  No. \"These pretzels are making me thirsty.\"  KRAMER  No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.  GEORGE  \"These pretzels are making me thirsty!!\"   Jerry pinches his nose. GEORGE  That was no good? KRAMER  I didn't say anything. ELAINE  I'm gonna go break up with Owen. GEORGE  What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!  George storms out.  New scene.  Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding on the door, Jerry opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man. JERRY  Oh my god. ELAINE  Call an ambulance. JERRY  Boy, he took it hard.  New scene.  Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what happened.  ELAINE  We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about   to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.  JERRY  Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A. ELAINE  Tell then to hurry! Hurry! JERRY  It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.  Kramer enters. KRAMER  These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty. JERRY  Kramer. KRAMER  What happened here? ELAINE  I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid? JERRY  Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?  ELAINE  What extremities? KRAMER  What's an extremity? JERRY  You raise the feet, get blood to the head.  KRAMER  You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.  ELAINE  Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.  JERRY  I don't have a washcloth. ELAINE  Well use a paper towel. JERRY  You can't put a paper towel on his head.  KRAMER  What about a big sponge? JERRY  How you gonna hold it on there? KRAMER  Use a belt. ELAINE  No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.  JERRY  Should we walk him around? ELAINE AND KRAMER  Yes, yes. KRAMER  Yeah, I've seen them do that. JERRY  No, no that's for a drug overdose.  KRAMER  Maybe that's what he's got. ELAINE  No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table. KRAMER  Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.  ELAINE  He is not a drug addict! JERRY  Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something. ELAINE  A cookie! KRAMER  Can you give him a cookie? ELAINE  How's he gonna chew it? JERRY  We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.   Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his jaw up and down.  ELAINE  Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.  KRAMER  I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.  ELAINE  You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it. JERRY  Cookies don't liquefy. ELAINE  Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.  KRAMER  Alright I'll get a blender. JERRY  What blender? I don't have a blender.  KRAMER  You got a blender. JERRY  I would know if I had a blender. ELAINE  Where is the ambulance?!  Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed by a crashing sound.  The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing. JERRY  Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago. ELAINE  I can't believe what's going on out here.  JERRY  This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes)   Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello? VOICE  Paramedics. JERRY  Come on up. Okay, they're here. ELAINE  He seems to be breathing. JERRY  Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.  ELAINE  I know. JERRY  Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?  ELAINE  Almost. JERRY  Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.  ELAINE  It's not an easy thing to bring up.  JERRY  Yeah, that's true. ELAINE  Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.  JERRY  Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.  ELAINE  He does, how'd you know that? JERRY  I could tell.  Two paramedics enter with a stretcher. ELAINE  What happened, what took you so long?!  PARAMEDIC  We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort. JERRY  Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!   George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth. GEORGE  Oh man. JERRY  What happened to the car? GEORGE  Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he? ELAINE  This guy I'm seeing. GEORGE  What happened? JERRY  We don't know! PARAMEDIC  Who put cookies in his mouth? JERRY AND ELAINE  Cookies? PARAMEDIC  You're not supposed to do that. JERRY  So how'd you hit the car? GEORGE  I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted. JERRY  It's not even my car, it's a rental.   Kramer enters. KRAMER  What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you. GEORGE  Woody mentioned me? What did he say?  KRAMER  He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?' GEORGE  Should I apologize to Woody? KRAMER  Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.  Mid-episode Monologue.  What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of years ago? You know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no equipment. Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole first aid. They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 'No, no we can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if you know that. Did you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before anybody.'   New scene.  Jerry, George and Sid are in Jerry's apartment. SID  Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that. GEORGE  Well I know how to drive. SID  Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me. JERRY  Can I get anybody anything? SID  Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on? GEORGE  I put my pants on, Sid. SID  I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those   cars. GEORGE  Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.  SID  Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs   surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars. GEORGE  Maybe I could call my father.  Kramer enters holding a newspaper. KRAMER  Hey, you seen the paper yet? JERRY  Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.  KRAMER  Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.   Jerry (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend. KRAMER  Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.  JERRY  The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner. SID  Oh lord. JERRY  The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.  New scene.  Elaine and Jerry are back at the car rental agency, Jerry's eating a bag of pretzels. ELAINE  Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'  JERRY  Can he communicate? ELAINE  Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy   it when I read to him. JERRY  Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed. ELAINE  So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community. JERRY  What community? There's a community?  ELAINE  Of course there's a community. JERRY  All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.  AGENT  Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred   and sixty-six dollars. JERRY  Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...  AGENT  Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident. JERRY  That is right, somebody else was driving.  AGENT  Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.  JERRY  Uh huh, what's that? AGENT  You're not covered for other drivers.  JERRY  Other drivers? AGENT  Um hm. JERRY  Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something? AGENT  Not that particular one. JERRY  Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you   want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care. AGENT  Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--  JERRY  Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that? AGENT  Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.  JERRY  These pretzels are making me thirsty.   New scene.  Elaine and Owen are at Owen's apartment, Owen is in a wheelchair and in generally unresponsive as Elaine feeds him soup. ELAINE  Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.  New scene.  Coffee shop. Elaine, Jerry and George are at their usual booth.  ELAINE  Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?  JERRY  An overdose of odor? Good question.  GEORGE  Do I smell? ELAINE  No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today,   it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen. JERRY  Ahh. GEORGE  He's alright? ELAINE  Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.  The waitress brings the check. JERRY  Let me get that. GEORGE  No no no, I got it. JERRY  Please. GEORGE  No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars, JERRY  Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.   Kramer enters and sits down. JERRY  What are you doing here? KRAMER  I got fired from the movie. GEORGE  Get out of here, why? KRAMER  Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it   twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered. ELAINE  Aww. KRAMER  Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.   Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the gloves.  JERRY  Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.   (Comedy club)  I think the best part of a relationship is when you're sick. And the best part of being sick is when you're in a relationship. And if I was to get married, you know all those vows; for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, all I need is the sickness. That, to me, is the most important one. Do you take this man in sickness? That's the only time I need somebody there. Rest of the time, go out, have a ball, do whatever you want, but if I get the sniffles, you better be there.

You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going \"I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?   (Commercial)  At a party JERRY  Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.  GEORGE  Like you do. JERRY  Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?  GEORGE  What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?  JERRY  I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?  GEORGE  Why did France give that to us anyway?  JERRY  It was a gift. GEORGE  So countries just exchange gifts like that?  JERRY  If they like each other. GEORGE  There's Elaine. JERRY  See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.  GEORGE  Really? They work here in the office?  JERRY  Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.  GEORGE  Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.  JERRY  You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.  GEORGE  Really? JERRY  Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.  GEORGE  \"Off the wagon\"? JERRY  I think it's off the wagon. GEORGE  I think it's \"on the wagon\". ELAINE  Jerry, George, what are you doing here?  JERRY  What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)  ELAINE  *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)  JERRY  Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.  ELAINE  Where did you find it? JERRY  Under the sofa cushion. ELAINE  And you stopped by just to give it to me?  JERRY  It's your Christmas present. ELAINE  I though I'd never find it. GEORGE  Well today's your lucky day. ELAINE  No. Today's *your* lucky day. GEORGE  It will be my first one. ELAINE  You want to work here? GEORGE  Huh? ELAINE  Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.  DICK  Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?  JERRY  \"The guy?\" ELAINE  (softly to Dick) Dick. GEORGE  How can you just get it? ELAINE  My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.  JERRY  Cranberry juice? ELAINE  And vodka. DICK  I got the cranberry juice. DICK  So... you're Jerry. JERRY  So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)  BOSS  So have you ever done this kind of work before?  GEORGE  Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.  BOSS  How do you read? GEORGE  I like Mike Lubika. BOSS  Mike Lubika? GEORGE  He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...  BOSS  No, no, no. I mean authors. GEORGE  Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.  BOSS  Name a couple. GEORGE  Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.  BOSS  Art Vandelay? GEORGE  He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.  BOSS  What has he written? GEORGE  Venetian Blinds. DICK  (picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.  JERRY  Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.  ELAINE  Where's my drink? JERRY  There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?  GEORGE  I think he was impressed. ELAINE  No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.  JERRY  Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.  ELAINE  Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.  JERRY  I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.  ELAINE  One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.  GEORGE  Told you.  At a clothing store. JERRY  I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.  GEORGE  Do I really have to buy her something?  JERRY  Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?  GEORGE  What is that? Is that cashmere? JERRY  Yeah. She would love cashmere. GEORGE  Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.  JERRY  Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.  GEORGE  Wow. Excuse me, Miss? WOMAN  Yes? GEORGE  How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?  WOMAN  (showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why.  GEORGE  What? I don't see anything. WOMAN  See this red dot? GEORGE  Oh yeah. JERRY  Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)  GEORGE  (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?  WOMAN  There's no exchanges on this. GEORGE  You think she would care about the red dot?  JERRY  It's hard to say. GEORGE  I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?  JERRY  Well I can see it. GEORGE  Yeah, but you know where it is. JERRY  Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?  GEORGE  Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?  JERRY  It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.  GEORGE  Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?  JERRY  You want me to take an overview? GEORGE  Please. JERRY  I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.   At Jerry's apartment. JERRY  Yeah so? ELAINE  He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.  JERRY  Oh boy, can you smell it? ELAINE  No. I can't smell it. JERRY  Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.  ELAINE  You don't always smell someone from a drink.  JERRY  Yes you do. ELAINE  What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?  JERRY  Yes you would.  Kramer enters JERRY  I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?  KRAMER  Okay. JERRY  Would you take a drink and let us smell you?  KRAMER  You can smell me without the drink.  ELAINE  I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.  KRAMER  Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?  JERRY  I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.   Kramer drinks. KRAMER  All right.  Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him. JERRY  I don't smell anything. ELAINE  Maybe we're too close to the bottle.   Jerry's buzzer buzzes. JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  (over the speaker) It's George. JERRY  Come on up. KRAMER  That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.  GEORGE  Hello everybody. KRAMER  Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.  GEORGE  (uncomfortablly) Thank you. ELAINE  Hey what's that? GEORGE  It's an early Christmas present. ELAINE  Christmas present? For who? GEORGE  For you. ELAINE  *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.  KRAMER  Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...  JERRY  Kramer. Yeah that'll do. ELAINE  (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?  GEORGE  Of course it's cashmere. ELAINE  Oh, I love cashmere. GEORGE  Well who doesn't. ELAINE  My, George this must have cost a fortune.  GEORGE  Ahh, money. ELAINE  Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?  JERRY  I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.  ELAINE  George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.  GEORGE  Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.  KRAMER  What's that red dot on your sweater?  ELAINE  What? GEORGE  Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.  ELAINE  Uhh. This. It's like a red dot. GEORGE  What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?  JERRY  (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.  ELAINE  What don't you know? JERRY  I don't know. ELAINE  Well do you see it or don't you? JERRY  Ahem. Say that again? ELAINE  Do you see it or don't you? JERRY  Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.   Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. He comes back groggy.  JERRY  Now what did you ask me again.  Kramer is snoring.  (Commercial)  (Whew, Jerry is saved by the bell.)  At the office. Elaine is walking by. ELAINE  You're still here. You're a dynamo.  GEORGE  I can't believe I get paid for this.  ELAINE  I'll see you tomorrow.  Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady comes by.  GEORGE  How you doing? CLEANING LADY  Hello.  The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the lady as she is cleaning.   At Monk's. JERRY  You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?  GEORGE  Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.  JERRY  Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.  GEORGE  Why is that? JERRY  It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.  GEORGE  So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)  JERRY  Convulsing? GEORGE  Convulsing? JERRY  I don't know, I'm trying to help you.  GEORGE  Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.  JERRY  You don't drink. GEORGE  I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.  JERRY  So you started drinking. GEORGE  So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.  JERRY  So how was it? GEORGE  Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.  JERRY  Good thing the cleaning lady was there.   At Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  Dick was fired. JERRY  You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.  ELAINE  You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?  JERRY  What are you saying? ELAINE  I'm not saying anything. JERRY  You're saying something. ELAINE  What could I be saying? JERRY  Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.  ELAINE  If I was saying something I would have said it.  JERRY  Well why don't you say it? ELAINE  I said it. JERRY  What did you say? ELAINE  Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.   Jerry's buzzer buzzes. JERRY  Yeah? GEORGE  (over the speaker) It's George. JERRY  Come on up. ELAINE  Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.  JERRY  No I didn't. ELAINE  Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.  JERRY  I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.  ELAINE  How much did he save? JERRY  Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.   Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom. GEORGE  I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.  JERRY  Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.  GEORGE  Did you tell her anything? JERRY  No. GEORGE  Do you swear? JERRY  I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.  GEORGE  Oh you told her didn't you. JERRY  No. ELAINE  Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?  GEORGE  What? Did I what? ELAINE  You did didn't you. GEORGE  Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.  ELAINE  Well Jerry told me that you did. GEORGE  You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.  JERRY  I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.  GEORGE  Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.   At the office. GEORGE  This is for you. LADY  Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.  GEORGE  As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.  LADY  Okay, okay, can I open it now? GEORGE  Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.  LADY  Oh! Is that cashmere? GEORGE  Of course it's cashemere. LADY  A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!  GEORGE  Just a little something for Christmas.  LADY  When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, \"what do you call this most beautiful fabric?\", and he said \"they call it cashmere\". I repeated the words \"cashmere, cashmere\". I asked if I could have it, and he said \"No. Get away from me.\" Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.  GEORGE  I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.  LADY  Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.  GEORGE  Take it off. You're going to ruin it.  LADY  (noticing the dot) What's this?  At the comedy club. JERRY  I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.  DICK  The only stench is comming from you.  AUDIENCE  Oooooh. JERRY  Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.  DICK  It's off the wagon. JERRY  In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?  DICK  I don't know. JERRY  On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?  DICK  You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.  JERRY  They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?  DICK  What the hell do you know about wagons?  JERRY  I know enough not to get on them.  In the boss' office. BOSS  I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?  GEORGE  Who said that? BOSS  She did. GEORGE  Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.  BOSS  You're fired. GEORGE  Well you didn't have to say it like that.  BOSS  I want you out of here by the end of the day.  GEORGE  What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?  BOSS  Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.   He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. George walks out of the office \"wearing\" it.   In the hall of the office. ELAINE  You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.  GEORGE  You never had sex in the office before?  ELAINE  No. I once made out with someone but that was it.  GEORGE  Alright so you made out with someone.  ELAINE  Well that's not sex. GEORGE  Kissing is sex. ELAINE  Kissing is not sex. JERRY  George? GEORGE  Jerry. ELAINE  Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?  GEORGE  No. JERRY  George? GEORGE  Over here. ELAINE  What are you doing here? JERRY  I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.  ELAINE  Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?  JERRY  I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.   (Commercial) ELAINE  So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.  JERRY  Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.   *crash* DICK  Merry Christmas. ELAINE  Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.  GEORGE  Hide, hide under the desk. ELAINE  Ow, ow move over. JERRY  Get off of me. ELAINE  I've got no room.  Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, his hand shaking.  DICK  Is that cashmere? GEORGE  Of course it's cashmere. DICK  (noticing the dot) What's this?  At the comedy club. JERRY  But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.  DICK  You mean on the wagon. JERRY  Don't get smart.   THE END>",

Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch   for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb   and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5,   but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith   and 9th street, then you got to get on the R. ELAINE  Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?  KRAMER  Well, yeah... ELAINE  Ok, what time is your job interview George?  GEORGE  9:45 JERRY  Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.  GEORGE  Why not? JERRY  That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of   a salesman'. GEORGE  What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The   biggest loser in history of American literature. ELAINE  All right, I'm gonna go. JERRY  What time is the lesbian wedding? ELAINE  9:30 GEORGE  Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they   flip a coin? ELAINE  Yeah, they flip a coin. GEORGE  What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.  JERRY  I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)  GEORGE  I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're  THINKING  \"That's why I'm not heterosexual\".  KRAMER  Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.  JERRY  Oh, I'm paying for breakfast? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of   deadbeats.  On the Subway. GEORGE  How many tickets are you paying today?  KRAMER  Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no   registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives   George a ticket) GEORGE  No doors? KRAMER  I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six   hundred bucks.  Blind violinist comes playing, with mug for the money. Everybody else gets   some change, except George. GEORGE  I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.  VIOLIN PLAYER  Thank you. GEORGE  That guy is not blind. JERRY  So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I   got to pick up my car at the pound. George? GEORGE  I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.  JERRY  Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was   aligned. GEORGE  That's amazing. JERRY  So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on   me. GEORGE  What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second   interview with them. JERRY  All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?  ELAINE  I can't. I'm the best man. JERRY  Kramer, bumper-cars? KRAMER  I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with   you? JERRY  Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to   rides alone. SUBWAY ANNOUNCEMENT  42th street. Change to D,N,RR,2,3,4,5,7,C,E,F train.   They all get off and go to different directions. ELAINE  See'ya.  Another subway. Jerry comes in and sits down. Fat man across him gives a   look.  George gets on another subway. Sits next to a beautiful woman. They smile to   another.  Kramer rushes to yet another subway and tries to find a seat. Stumbles   around as all seats get filled right before him.  He squeezes himself to same seat with obese young man.  Jerry is falling asleep and leans towards the next guy who leaves and Jerry   falls in his seat.  Woman next to George rubs her leg and George looks at her. WOMAN  You looking for a job? GEORGE  Me, why? WOMAN  Well, you're reading the classifieds.  GEORGE  Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is.   Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM   up a quarter. WOMEN  You didn't look like someone who needed a job.  GEORGE  Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.  WOMEN  So, you're in 'the market'? GEORGE  Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'. WOMEN  Which market? GEORGE  Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board.   Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there. WOMEN  So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?  GEORGE  They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion.   Big broker-houses killed my father. WOMAN  Really? GEORGE  Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long   story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would   never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm   about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've   never looked back.  Train horn blows and George looks back  Elaine's train. She's carrying a wedding present. A older woman approaches   her WOMAN  I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would   give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.  ELAINE  It's ironic. WOMEN  What's ironic? ELAINE  This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress,   but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties. WOMAN  No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?  ELAINE  Oh... WOMAN  Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?  ELAINE  A wedding. WOMEN  A wedding? ELAINE  Yeah WOMAN  Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with   men and women. ELAINE  You're telling me. WOMAN  So, are they a nice couple? ELAINE  Oh, very nice. WOMAN  What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?  ELAINE  She. WOMEN  She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son.  ELAINE  There is no he. WOMEN  There is no he. So, who's getting married?  ELAINE  Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.  WOMEN  Lesbian wedding. ELAINE  Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.  WOMEN  My luck. I don't talk to a soul in the   subway for 35 years. I get a best man at a lesbian wedding. (leaves)  ELAINE  No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men,   but I'm not a lesbian!  Kramer's train. A man leaves and lefts a newspaper to his seat.   Kramer and another guy glance each other and rush to get the paper. The   other man gets to it first and Kramer gets only little piece of one page.   Jerry's train. He is still sleeping and trying not to fall to the floor.   Man across gives him a look.  Elaine's train. Train is full packed. ELAINE'S VOICE  I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe   I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.  Train suddenly stops ELAINE'S VOICE  Oh, man. We're stopping?  George's train. WOMAN  Well, this is where I get off. GEORGE  Oh, you do? WOMAN  Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.  GEORGE  No, no, what, what? WOMAN  Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're   obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.  GEORGE  Yeah, well.... WOMAN  Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.  George is in agony thinking if he should go or stay. Then runs after her  GEORGE  Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when   I wanna get off.  He gets stuck between closing doors. GEORGE  I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train!   Don't start the train!!  Kramer is reading a newspaper. Couple of men behind him are talking.  MAN1  This, it's the fourth horse of the first race, Pappanick.  MAN2  How do you know it's going to win?  MAN1  My UPS-guy tells. Guys who own the horses are regular customers.   Every horse he has ever given me has won.  See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been   getting it light cause they've been using bug boy and the workout hasn't   been published. Now they are ready to run with it. They are gonna break his   a lock. MAN2  But it rained last night. MAN1  Exactly, this horse loves the slop. It's in his bloodlines. His   father was a mudda', his mother was a mudda'. MAN2  His mudda' was a mudda'? MAN1  What did I just say? Come on, let's go to the office, I'm going to   call my bookie. Hey, don't tell anybody.  Kramer quickly turns away  Jerry wakes up and looks to guy opposite to him. The fat guy is naked and   reading a paper. JERRY  O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?  NAKED MAN  Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference.  JERRY  You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.  NAKED MAN  You got something against naked body?  JERRY  I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends,   maybe a squat thrust? NAKED MAN  Who's got time for squat thrusts? JERRY  All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a   'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy. NAKED MAN  I like a good breakfast. JERRY  I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up   trapped in a room with bimbo broals(?) and pigtails, been counseled by Dick   Gregory. NAKED MAN  I'm not ashamed of my body. JERRY  That's your problem, you should be.   Naked man drops half of his newspaper JERRY  Don't get up, please, allow me.  Jerry picks up the paper  Elaine is still trapped in a stopped train. ELAINE'S VOICE  Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need.   Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're   stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people?   This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is   so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel   something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in   a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring.   What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't   breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about   the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And   hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This   is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help   me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What   can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a   train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the   conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be   moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!   Lights in the train go off  George and the woman step in to a hotel room. GEORGE  Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.  WOMAN  Make your-self comfortable.  She steps in to bathroom. GEORGE'S VOICE  Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want   me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my   clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot.   She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what   then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself   comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing   can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There,   that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.   She comes out from the bathroom, wearing a nightie. GEORGE  Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.   Kramer is in the \"Off-track betting\" office. He is talking with a guy   behind in the line. KRAMER  Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.  GUY  The bug boy. KRAMER  Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break   his maiden. GUY  Really? But, it's a little bit slow out there it rained last night.  KRAMER  Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob.   Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'. GUY  His father was a mudda'? KRAMER  His mother was a mudda'. GUY  His mother was a mudda'? KRAMER  What did I just say?  Kramer gets to the cashier KRAMER  Hey,all right, 600 Pappanick to win.   Jerry's train FG  They still have no pitching. Goodin's a question mahk. ...You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast.  JS  I'm not worried about their best pitching.

FG  I LUV their chances. JS  Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.  FG  It's a deal!  Elaine is in a stopped train with no lights. ELAINE'S VOICE  Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life   could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What   if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1   banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still   here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! Train starts   moving, lights get back on It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! Train   stops again and lights go off Motherf(beep-beep)!!!  George and the beautiful woman are still in the hotel room. The woman is   putting handcuffs on George and the other end to the backboard of the bed.  GEORGE  Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.  WOMAN  Oh, don't worry. I do.  She steps in to the bathroom GEORGE  You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in   her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really   disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version   of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing,   cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse   looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear. WOMAN  Like what? GEORGE  Like a \"Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts   your mother to shame\"  She comes out of the bathroom fully clothed GEORGE  What's going on? WOMAN  It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I   have to get going. GEORGE  Get going? But we haven't really, you know....  WOMAN  Eight dollars? Eight dollars? GEORGE  What are you doing? You're robbing me?  WOMEN  I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?  GEORGE  Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?  WOMAN  I'm taking your clothes. GEORGE  No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg .  WOMAN  Bye George. GEORGE  No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?   Kramer is in the \"Off-track betting\" office. The race is on and Pappanick   is slowly making ground  yes...  The winner is Pappanick KRAMER  Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)   Kramer collects the winnings. A big pile of cash. Shows the money around.   There is a big thug looking at the money.  Kramer goes into the subway and sees that the thug followed him. He makes   a run for it. Thug follows. Kramer steps out of the train and so does the   thug. Kramer tries to jump back on the train, but door closes.   The naked man has put his clothes back on and he and Jerry are getting of   the train. I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.  JERRY  First we ride the cyclone. Chilly out.  Jerry takes a deep breath JERRY  Aah, French fries.  Kramer is running away from the thug and enters the train where the blind   violinist is playing. Kramer knocks down the violin player and the thug   picks Kramer up and looks for the money. THUG  Give me the money. Give me the money!   Police!\"  Back to the Monk's café. Jerry, Kramer and Elaine are sitting in a booth.  JERRY  No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the   time I got to the police garage, it was closed. ELAINE  Too bad. JERRY  You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at   what we won!  Waves around a stuffed monkey JERRY  You want him? ELAINE  Get that out of my face. JERRY  So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!   George enters wearing a sheet. GEORGE  How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little   punk? ELAINE  George? JERRY  Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?  GEORGE  You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?  JERRY  Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer. GEORGE  Give me your key, I gotta get it. KRAMER  What happened? GEORGE  Never mind what happened, just give me the key.  JERRY  Come on, I'll go with you. ELAINE  Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)  KRAMER  Wait, wait, wait...  Kramer gets the check, looks at it and gets pile of cash and pays. Jerry and Elaine look amazed.   THE END>",

        "text": "  THE PEZ DISPENSER Written by   Larry David   (Jerry's Apartment) GEORGE  ...pianist. A classical pianist. She plays the piano. She's a   brilliant woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the   Waldstein Sonata! The Waldstein! GEORGE  We did a crossword puzzle together, in bed. It was the most fun   I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my life!  Y'know?  Jerry enters JERRY  Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.  GEORGE  I was telling you about Noel. JERRY  Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...  GEORGE  (sarcastically) Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...  JERRY  All right, I'm sorry. What about her?  GEORGE  What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?  JERRY  I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.  GEORGE  No everything is not going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have   no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. Once in   my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at   all. She has the hand; I have no hand... GEORGE  How do I get the hand? JERRY  We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the   hand right from the opening. GEORGE  She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...  JERRY  Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...  GEORGE  Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll   see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself.   Maybe I can get some hand that way.  Kramer enters KRAMER  Hey, smell my arm... Smell it! GEORGE  With all due respect, I don't think so...  JERRY  That smells good, what is that? KRAMER  The beach! JERRY  The beach? GEORGE  What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!  KRAMER  I just joined the Polar Bear Club.  JERRY  You joined the Polar Bears?! GEORGE  What the Hell is a \"Polar Bear\"? KRAMER  Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....  JERRY  Yeah... So's shock therapy. JERRY  (with glee) What is that, a Pez dispenser?!  KRAMER  Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.  GEORGE  Hey, what goes on there, exactly? JERRY  You don't know? GEORGE  No, I-I-I know... (retreats back to his Chinese take out) I know...  JERRY  You think they have fleas there, don't you?  GEORGE  No... JERRY  Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you   think they have fleas there. GEORGE  All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...  ELAINELAINE  I don't know how anyone does this. It must be so nerve racking...   How do they warm up their fingers? JERRY  They have a piano backstage they warm up on.  ELAINELAINE  No, we would have heard it. JERRY  What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?  GEORGE  I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud   when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet. JERRY  (quickly whispering) I resent that you said that! That's   directed at me, isn't it?!  A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano. JERRY  Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)  STEVE  Something I said? (no response) It's John... Mollika.  ELAINELAINE  Oh, oh, John... Oh, hi John... Hi...  STEVE  What're you doing down here? ELAINE  Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I   started laughing. MOLLIKA  Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.  ELAINE  We did. We're just hanging out. MOLLIKA  REally. ... You really look great.  ELAINE  Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?  MOLLIKA  Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He   just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs.   I don't know what to do for the guy. ELAINE  Have you thought about an intervention?  MOLLIKA  What's that? ELAINE  You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get   him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now. MOLLIKA  He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to   Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.   Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.  Outside Noel's dressing room ELAINELAINE  I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry! GEORGE  What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first   place? JERRY  I dunno, it was an impulse. GEORGE  What kind of a sick impulse does that??  JERRY  How could I know she would start to laugh?  ELAINELAINE  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am! JERRY  Can we just go in already? GEORGE  What are we gonna tell her? ELAINELAINE  I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.  GEORGE  No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then   I'm a jerk... ELAINELAINE  (To Jerry) Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.  JERRY  What about? GEORGE  Hey, hey! We're discussing something!  JERRY  I know, but I'm distracted now. GEORGE  What are you? A baby!? All right. Tell her.   E When I was outside I ran into John Mollika. JERRY  Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?  ELAINE  He's good. GEORGE  Uh, can we cut to the chase? JERRY  \"Cut to the chase\"? GEORGE  Yeah... JERRY  What're you, \"Joe Hollywood\"? GEORGE  A lot of people say it. JERRY  I would lose that. GEORGE  (Accusingly) What's that? JERRY  \"Lose that\"? That's not a Hollywood expression!  GEORGE  (Realizing full well it isn't) ...Yes it is.  ELAINE  Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from   Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told  him that he should do an intervention. JERRY  Really, an intervention ... GEORGE  Y'know people, we got a situation over here!  ELAINE  Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.  JERRY  Me? Why me? ELAINE  'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.  JERRY  Y'know these things are really hard to load...  GEORGE  All right, OK, I'm goin' in. JERRY  We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)  ELAINE  All right.  (They Enter) GEORGE  Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful. NOEL  No.. GEORGE  Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel  JERRY  You play a Hell of a piano. ELAINE  Yeah, I was really moved, really moved.  NOEL  Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was   humiliated... ELAINE  Well, I'm sure it wasn't at you. NOEL  Well then, what was she laughing at?  JERRY  Pez? NOEL  Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?  GEORGE  Me, uh, uh, no, ... JERRY  Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.  ELAINE  Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.  JERRY  Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.  NOEL  I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. (exits)  ELAINE  I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.  GEORGE  If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)   (Noel enters) GEORGE  All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.  NOEL  I don't feel like it tonight. JERRY  We'll be outside ELAINE  Yeah JERRY  It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?  N  I just crack my knuckles. GEORGE  We'll have a good time N  I don't feel like it GEORGE  Ah, come on N  I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT! GEORGE  Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqué. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. (exits)   (MONKS) JERRY  You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.  ELAINE  What? How? JERRY  A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable.   Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.  ELAINE  So? What happened? JERRY  What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia,   and a month later he was dead. ELAINE  Shut up! JERRY  All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.  ELAINE  Whar about Kramer? JERRY  He's the same!  (Jerry on phone at home) JERRY  Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for   an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye.   (to Kramer) Remember Ricie Appel? KRAMER  (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?  JERRY  Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.  KRAMER  Can I get in on that? JERRY  What do you think? It's like a poker game?  KRAMER  Is Elaine going? JERRY  Yeah KRAMER  Well, I knew him as well as she did.  JERRY  Yeah, but John invited her. KRAMER  So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?  JERRY  No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.   Buzzer GEORGE  It's George JERRY  Stop smelling your arm. KRAMER  You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just   came home from the beach JERRY  Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, \"That's not a bad idea.\"  KRAMER  Tell me about it! JERRY  Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein.   In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.   (George enters) GEORGE  Well it's over. It's definitely over.  JERRY  She broke up with you? GEORGE  No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation.   I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.  JERRY  What was on the list? GEORGE  Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,  JERRY  Yeah, Postum is under-ratted, GEORGE  Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said   \"no, maybe we could get together for lunch.\" You know what that means.  JERRY  What's wrong with lunch? GEORGE  Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted.   I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.  KRAMER  I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?  GEORGE  I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.  KRAMER  Break up with her GEORGE  What? KRAMER  You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.  JERRY  A preemptive breakup. GEORGE  A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose.   We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some   Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.   (MONKS) GEORGE  So, I am have to going to break up with you.  NOEL  You're breaking up with me? GEORGE  I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.  NOEL  Wow. GEORGE  Shocked? NOEL  I really am. GEORGE  Never expected this did you? NOEL  I thought everything was fine. GEORGE  Well, live and learn. NOEL  I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?  GEORGE  Kind of. NOEL  I'm very confused. GEORGE  Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.  NOEL  I thought,... GEORGE  Now, stop it ... NOEL  What do you want, I can make you happy.  GEORGE  When you're playing the piano do you think about me?  NOEL  I don't know. GEORGE  This is what I'm talking about. NOEL  OK, I'll think about you. GEORGE  All the time. NOEL  All the time? ... OK, All the time.  GEORGE  I can't hear you. NOEL  All the time. ALL THE TIME. GEORGE  See, It's not so hard.  (CALVIN KLEIN) KRAMER  Go ahead smell, smell STEVE  Yeah, so? KRAMER  Do you recognize it? ... The beach.  STEVE  What are you talking about? KRAMER  Oh, I'm talking about the beach. STEVE  What about it? KRAMER  You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach?   Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell.   Oh yeah. STEVE  That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.  KRAMER  Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?  STEVE  Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead   fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come   home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.  KRAMER  So you don't think it's a good idea?  THE INTERVENTION  I may have confused the names of some of the male interveners below)   To Elaine GUY  The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a   kid so I have to stick tissue up there ELAINE  (very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?  GUY  Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.   To Jerry OTHER GUY  Are there any ice cubes? JERRY  In the freezer. OTHER GUY  I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.  JERRY  Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.  OTHER GUY  I can't drink this. It's warm! (walks away)  GUY  Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?  STEVE  What's the plan? JERRY  Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.  OTHER GUY  Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either.  GUY  No, we all have to talk. ELAINE  What's the order? GUY  We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.  ROBERTA  Why am I first? ELAINE  Albano is your last name. ROBERTA  That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.  STEVE  I'll go first.  Kramer enters KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Is this the interference? JERRY  Intervention. OTHER GUY  What are you doing here? KRAMER  Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?  STEVE  Hey, this is for close friends only.  KRAMER  I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade   over Marty Benson's head? OTHER GUY  Let him stay. KRAMER  Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.  STEVE  Somebody's going to make that crap?   Some old guys enter OLD GUY  Kramer! KRAMER  Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.  OTHER GUY  They can't stay. OLD GUY  We're having a party here? JERRY  No, we're having an intervention OLD GUY  An intervention? Who's intervening?  JERRY  There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.  OLD GUY  Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped   coming. We would go to his house and say, \"What you don't want to be a   polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?\"  Buzzer GUY  It's him. ROBERTA  What should we do? ELAINE  Hide! JERRY  It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)  GEORGE  It's George JERRY  Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.  GUY  If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.  ELAINE  Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.  GUY  Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?  ELAINE  You're getting warm.  George and Noel enter (Noel looks awful) GEORGE  We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.  JERRY  We're having the intervention for Richie.  GEORGE  Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?  JERRY  Well, uh.. NOEL  (happily) Elaine, hi. ELAINE  Oh, hi Noel  (Noel sits on couch with Elaine with Old Guy between them) JERRY  Well, you're looking well. GEORGE  Jerry, let me tell you something, \"A man without hand is not a man.\"   I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.  STEVE  Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.  GEORGE  (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!  STEVE  You think so? GEORGE  I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you  OLD MAN  The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy.  ELAINE  (Chuckles)  Old GUY; at least give me a pocket. ELAINE  (laughs)  Noel turns to Elaine. Jerry raises his eyes to heaven NOEL  That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.  ELAINE  No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.   Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg. NOEL  You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.  JERRY  I didn't know she would laugh. NOEL  You lied to me George, you lied to me.  GEORGE  No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?  NOEL  I ... am breaking up ... with you!  GEORGE  You can't break up with me. I've got hand.  NOEL  And you're going to need it.  Noel exits, George chases her  Richie and John enter JERRY  Hey Richie RICHIE  So what's going on?  Later JERRY  It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's   talking back. GEORGE  I can't do these puzzles. JERRY  So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table  GEORGE  Ah ah Pez dispenser. JERRY  He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's   telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and   his father was trying to load one of them GEORGE  Well they're hard to load. JERRY  Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control   of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all   over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.  GEORGE  Poor kid. JERRY  So as he's telling the story he starts crying.  GEORGE  What did you do? JERRY  What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.  GEORGE  Wow JERRY  Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday.   He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.  GEORGE  What's a three letter word for candy?  JERRY  I can't do those things.   THE END>",

        "text": "    THE SUICIDE Written by   Tom Leopold   (Comedy club)  The thing I don't understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don't die and that's it. They stop trying. Why? Why don't they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it's worse because now they've found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that's why these people don't succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I say, pills don't work, try a rope. Car won't start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There's nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.   (Jerry's Apartment) JERRY  Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?  ELAINE  Na. JERRY  What are you doing? We're going out for dinner in ten minutes.  ELAINE  Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?   (buzzer) JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  It's George. JERRY  Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?  ELAINE  I don't know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?  JERRY  I think I'll take out the garbage.  ELAINE  Hey, have you ever fasted? JERRY  Well, once I didn't have dinner until, like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya'? Throw out my garbage for me.  GEORGE  Yeah, right. JERRY  Come on, it's just down the hall. GEORGE  Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two bucks.  JERRY  I'll give you 50 cents. GEORGE  There's no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.  JERRY  Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake's coffee cake  GEORGE  You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.  JERRY  I don't get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?  GEORGE  It's an incredible deal. I don't know why you don't come with me.  JERRY  Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm not going to commit to an airline.   (Gina enters the hall) GINA  Hi. JERRY  Hi. GINA  How are you? JERRY  Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee Cake is?  GINA  Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.  JERRY  How much do they cost? GINA  The junior? GEORGE  No, no the full size. JERRY  No, no the junior. GEORGE  You didn't say \"junior\". GINA  I haven't had one of those since I was a little girl.  JERRY  Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya' doing?  MARTIN  Good enough.  (MARTIN leaves with Gina) JERRY  Boy she's sexy isn't she?  (Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer's apartment and knocks on the door. As he and George enter Jerry's apartment Kramer comes out and takes the garbage bag.)  JERRY  Do you believe that guy? ELAINE  What guy? JERRY  My neighbour: ELAINE  Oh, that creepy guy? JERRY  Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?  GEORGE  He didn't seem too pleased. ELAINE  Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried onion wings.  GEORGE  hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.  JERRY  What's so amazing? You've seen him before.  GEORGE  I haven't seen him for months. JERRY  What was the dream? GEORGE  I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.  JERRY  I think I've played there. GEORGE  I've had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.  JERRY  You're a little paranormal ELAINE  Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.  GEORGE  Really? ELAINE  Uh uh, you should go some time. GEORGE  I'd love to go. Make an appointment.  JERRY  Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?  GEORGE  I just got fired. JERRY  Alright, come on, lets get out of here.  ELAINE  I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.  JERRY  I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.  ELAINE  Really? JERRY  Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.  (They exit)  (Jerry's apartment late at night there is knocking at the door)  JERRY  Who is it? Who is it? GINA  It's Gina. JERRY  Who? GINA  Martine's girl friend. JERRY  Martine? GINA  You next door neighbour. JERRY  Oh, Martin!  (Jerry opens door) GEORGE  It's Martine. I think he's dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.  JERRY  What? GINA  Come on. JERRY  In my pajamas? I better get my robe.  GINA  We don't have enough time. JERRY  It'll take two seconds. GINA  There is no time. JERRY  We don't have two seconds? GINA  All right. Go ahead. JERRY  Nah, forget it. GINA  No, go ahead. JERRY  Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas. GINA  Will you just get it. JERRY  Are you sure? GINA  Forget it. Come on. JERRY  Nah, I'll go get the robe.  (Metropolitan Hospital Center) JERRY  That's not too bad. It's not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.  GINA  You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.  JERRY  Really? It's over? GINA  I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man's hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.  JERRY  Oh boy, did he say anything about me?  GINA  He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake's Coffee Cake.  JERRY  He said that? GINA  He was screaming about it all night. How it's too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.  JERRY  I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.  GINA  I wasn't. JERRY  You weren't? GINA  No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?  JERRY  Of course. GINA  Tell me everything. JERRY  Are you sure he can't hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.  GINA  I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.  JERRY  I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they're going to look at a thing like this.  GINA  I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.  JERRY  No, I just wanted to see what time it was.  GINA  Are you afraid of him? JERRY  No. GINA  Then kiss me. JERRY  Here? GINA  Yes, right here. JERRY  Is this the proper venue? GINA  You don't want to? JERRY  No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.  GINA  Then kiss me right in front of him.  JERRY  I can't. What if he wakes up? GINA  A man is lying here unconscious and you're afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?  JERRY  A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going like this ... you don't want to mess with it.   (Jerry's apartment) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Did you hear about Martin? JERRY  Yeah, I heard. KRAMER  I can't believe he's in a coma. KRAMER  He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?  JERRY  Who told you about Martin? KRAMER  Newman! He's good friends with him.   Jx; Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed. KRAMER  He's got all of my attachments, you know.  JERRY  Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?  KRAMER  What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?  JERRY  You know I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?  KRAMER  So what's going on between you and Gina?  JERRY  Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.  KRAMER  Uh, uh. JERRY  So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.  KRAMER  Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?  JERRY  Nothing. KRAMER  Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?  JERRY  I didn't know what the coma etiquette was.  KRAMER  There is no coma etiquette. You see that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it.  JERRY  So you're saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.  KRAMER  I'd give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, it's a land rush.  JERRY  So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he's thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there's nothing left?  KRAMER  NOTHING LEFT! That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody's going to grab it.   (The psychic's apartment) RULA  Martin's spirit came to you as a warning.  ELAINE  Why would he come to George? RULA  Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.  GEORGE  I knew it. I always felt different.  RULA  You are. Some coffee cake? GEORGE  Drakes? RULA  Yes. GEORGE  Did you buy this for me? RULA  No, why? GEORGE  Ha, because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.  RULA  Maybe I did. ELAINE  Take it away. GEORGE  She hasn't eaten in two days. RULA  Who's Pauline? GEORGE  Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.  RULA  Do you think about her? GEORGE  When I hear her name mentioned. RULA  Cut these with your left hand. GEORGE  There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.  RULA  I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.  GEORGE  Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?  RULA  Not in this life. ELAINE  Should you be smoking? RULA  Does it bother you? ELAINE  You're pregnant. GEORGE  Elaine. RULA  I smoked when I had Faisy. RULA  Ah oh. GEORGE  Ah oh? What? What Ah oh? RULA  I don't know about this trip George.  GEORGE  You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?  ELAINE  It's really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.  GEORGE  Elaine, she's a psychic. She knows how the kid's going to be.  GEORGE  Should I not go on this trip? RULA  George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.  ELAINE  Now listen. I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.  GEORGE  Elaine, what are you doing? ELAINE  It's disgusting. RULA  I DON'T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.  ELAINE  Oh fine, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.  RULA  Get the hell out.  (Elaine leaving) GEORGE  A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?  RULA  Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.  GEORGE  If you don't say anything I will assume it's a plane crash.  RULA  Get out. GEORGE  Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?   (Jerry's apartment) GINA  I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.  JERRY  You can say what you want about me but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.  GINA  It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?  JERRY  No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.  GINA  Who are these Stooges you speak of?  JERRY  They're a comedy team. GINA  Tell me about them. Everything. JERRY  Well, they're three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.  GINA  You will show me The Stooges? JERRY  I will show you The Stooges. GINA  When? JERRY  Well, I don't really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.  GINA  Come, you walk me to a cab. JERRY  Well, uh, I uh, I don't want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it's not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.  GINA  You're still afraid. You are not a man.  JERRY  Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?  GINA  Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?  JERRY  Yeah, all right. All right.  (Jerry and Gina meet Kramer and leaving his apartment with Newman)  KRAMER  You should just eat fruit. NEWMAN  I can't eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.  KRAMER  ??? NEWMAN  Hello Gina. Hello Jerry. JERRY  Hello Newman.  (Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway) JERRY  Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.  GEORGE  People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn't hurt me.  ELAINE  (jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?  JERRY  Boy, it's a good thing we came. GEORGE  Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there's native unrest.  ELAINE  Hi, I haven't eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.  NURSE  We'll call you. JERRY  George, I want you to promise me something. If I'm ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.  GEORGE  How come? JERRY  Looters. ELAINE  How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?  JERRY  She's really hungry.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey. ELAINE  Kramer KRAMER  Well, Newman's upstairs visiting Martin.  GEORGE  Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?  KRAMER  You're not going? GEORGE  No. KRAMER  Why not? GEORGE  The psychic said something terrible will happen.  KRAMER  I dig.  (Metropolitan Hospital Center - Martin's room) KRAMER  I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she's going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she's going to kill me.  W  He can't hear you, you idiot. Why don't you just buy another one.  KRAMER  Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?  W  I have a carpet sweeper you can use.  KRAMER  I don't want a carpet sweeper. They don't do anything.  W  It gets my rug clean. KRAMER  The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.  W  Well, you should take a look at my rug then.  KRAMER  I wouldn't set foot in your house.   (Jerry enters) JERRY  Hello. NEWMAN  Hello Jerry. JERRY  How's he doing? KRAMER  He looks happy to me. NEWMAN  I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.  JERRY  Why wouldn't he? NEWMAN  No reason. JERRY  He'll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.  NEWMAN  I'll bring him up to date. JERRY  How up to date? NEWMAN  Oh, all the way up. JERRY  And nothing could change your mind?  NEWMAN  Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.  KRAMER  Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He's not going.  NEWMAN  I don't care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..  JERRY  Drake's Coffee Cake NEWMAN  Wow, where did you get that? JERRY  From my house. I got a whole box of them.  NEWMAN  Boy, that's the full size. JERRY  That's your big boy. NEWMAN  Can I have a bite? JERRY  I don't give out bites. I got another one. But I'm saving it for later.  NEWMAN  Just one bite? JERRY  I don't think so. You know they, they're so fragile.  NEWMAN  All right! All right. I won't say anything.  JERRY  You swear? NEWMAN  I swear. JERRY  On your mother's life? NEWMAN  On my mother's life. KRAMER  oh oh oh oh oh NEWMAN  Oooh,  (Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway) ELAINE  And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.   (George sees the Psychic's girl, Faisy and follows her into the Psychic's room))  GEORGE  ...sweetheart, no come here, ... sweetheart  RULA  pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing) GEORGE  how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.  RULA  The nurse said she would be right back. They're supposed to take me into the delivery room.  GEORGE  Oh, that's great. That's great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don't even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn't get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..  RULA  Oh, where's the nurse GEORGE  I don't know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don't you get a nurse for mommy? ... Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.  RULA  Don't take that trip. GEORGE  Yeah, why? Why? RULA  (screams) EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit.   (Doctor enters) DX  All right, Rula, it's time to go. GEORGE  Because? Because?  (Elaine enters Martins room) ELAINE  Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! ... Drake's Coffee Cake? ... Give me that.  NEWMAN  Jerry, you better stop her or I'll tell.  JERRY  Elaine! No! No! MARTIN  Ooooh, ahhhh,  (In hallway as they wheel Rula to give birth) GEORGE  Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?   (Martin's room  Martin grabbing Jerry  Elaine eating the Drake's Coffee Cake)  NEWMAN  He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.  KRAMER  I want my vacuum cleaner! JERRY  Hey! NEWMAN  It was disgusting.  (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  What are you doing? We're going out to dinner in ten minutes.  GEORGE  I never assisted in a birth before. It's really quite disgusting.  JERRY  What did she name the kid? GEORGE  You wouldn't believe it. Rasputin.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Heey! GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  Hey. GEORGE  when did you get back? KRAMER  A couple of hours ago. GEORGE  So how was it? KRAMER  George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.  JERRY  osh. KRAMER  They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.  JERRY  Woah. (hitting George) KRAMER  Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.  JERRY  Wow! (hitting George) KRAMER  I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson  JERRY  Oh! (hitting George) KRAMER  We played Backgammon in the nude. JERRY  Oh! (hitting George) KRAMER  She's a sweet kid. JERRY  Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!  KRAMER  Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That's probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.  GEORGE  Yeah, you gotta' watch for the jellyfish.  KRAMER  Yeah. KRAMER  What's this? JERRY  Oh, it's an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.  KRAMER  They moved in together? JERRY  Yeah, it's some place down in the village.  KRAMER  Phew.  (buzzer) JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  It's Elaine. JERRY  All right we're coming down. KRAMER  Hey, where ya' going? JERRY  We're taking Elaine to dinner. She's got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?  KRAMER  Um, I'd like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we'll be getting together.  GEORGE  Elle McPherson going to be there? KRAMER  OH! I got to call her back.  (Kramer exits) THE END>",

        "text": "  THE FIX-UP Written by      Larry Charles &amp; Elaine Pope   (Comedy club)  I tell ya, I never really understood the importance of the conductor. I mean between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing? Do you really need somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin? Does that really help you out? I could see how we need him at the beginning. Okay, tap-tap-tap, start. Okay, I can see how you need that. But once we're going, okay, once it's all happening, what do we need him for then? I don't see the cellist looking up, go, \"I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.\" And the conductor goes, \"Do this. Like this\" \"Oh, okay, thank you very much.\"  Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant. GEORGE  Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it. JERRY  Oh, yes you will. GEORGE  No, I won't. JERRY  Yeah, maybe you won't. GEORGE  I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.  JERRY  Are my nostrils getting bigger? GEORGE  No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, \"Hi. I'm George. How are you?\" Is that so terrible?  Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers up a meek 'Hi' which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' a few more times as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though we was saying that anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch than read.)   Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another restaurant.  CYNTHIA  There's just no men out there, you know?  ELAINE  I know. CYNTHIA  I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person. ELAINE  I hate the good ones. CYNTHIA  Is Jerry one of the good ones? ELAINE  That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.  CYNTHIA  Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, \"Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?\" and eventually I just go, \"You're right.\" ELAINE  You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.  CYNTHIA  No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.  Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily. GEORGE  I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one. JERRY  Oh, so there's still hope. GEORGE  I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive. JERRY  Oh, so hopelessness is the key. GEORGE  It's my only hope.  Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia. CYNTHIA  See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.  ELAINE  Well, at least you're not bitter. CYNTHIA  Who says I'm not bitter? ELAINE  Aren't you too young to be bitter?  CYNTHIA  No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.  ELAINE  Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.  CYNTHIA  Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.   Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.  JERRY  Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.  ELAINE  So what'd you do last night? JERRY  Went out with George, you? ELAINE  Went out with Cynthia. JERRY  How was it? What'd you talk about?  ELAINE  Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you? JERRY  We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody. ELAINE  I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.  JERRY  George too.  They look at each other for a moment. JERRY AND ELAINE  Yeah, right. JERRY  I've never fixed anybody up. ELAINE  Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.  JERRY  Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George? ELAINE  I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?  JERRY  Well you implied it. ELAINE  I didn't say it. JERRY  Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she? ELAINE  Who is he? JERRY  He's George! ELAINE  She's Cynthia! JERRY  So what? ELAINE  What, you don't think she's beautiful?  JERRY  I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?  ELAINE  You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.  JERRY  I went out with you. ELAINE  That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.  JERRY  Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook. ELAINE  He can really do that? JERRY  Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.  ELAINE  What, are you into this? JERRY  Yeah, come on, it's a good match. ELAINE  No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information? JERRY  Naturally. ELAINE  Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret? JERRY  Everything. ELAINE  What if it worked out? JERRY  Yeah right.  Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment. GEORGE  Out of the question. Out of the question!  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like? JERRY  She's good looking. GEORGE  How good looking? JERRY  Very good looking. GEORGE  Really good looking? JERRY  Really very good looking. GEORGE  Would you take her out? JERRY  Yes, I would take her out. GEORGE  Oh, you hesitated. JERRY  What hesitate? I didn't hesitate! GEORGE  No, something's off here, you hesitated.  JERRY  I'm telling you, she's good looking.  GEORGE  What about the body, what kind of body?  JERRY  Good body, nice body. GEORGE  How nice? JERRY  Nice. GEORGE  Just nice? JERRY  Pretty nice. GEORGE  Really good? JERRY  Really very nice and good. GEORGE  What about personality? JERRY  Good personality. Funny. Bright. GEORGE  Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.  JERRY  How could she be smarter than you?  GEORGE  Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?  Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion. CYNTHIA  First of all, what does he do? ELAINE  He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-  CYNTHIA  He's not working?! How come he's not working?  ELAINE  Well, um, he, he got fired. CYNTHIA  Why did he get fired? ELAINE  Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.  CYNTHIA  Excuse me? ELAINE  Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work. CYNTHIA  Is he nuts? ELAINE  No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.  CYNTHIA  What does he look like? ELAINE  Pardon? CYNTHIA  What does he look like? ELAINE  Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky. CYNTHIA  Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?  ELAINE  Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair. CYNTHIA  He's bald? ELAINE  No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.  CYNTHIA  So he will be bald. ELAINE  Yup.  Cut back to Jerry and George. GEORGE  What kind of hair? JERRY  You know, long dark hair. GEORGE  Flowing? JERRY  Flowing? GEORGE  Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me. JERRY  'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?  GEORGE  Yeah, that's right. JERRY  Just clarifying. GEORGE  Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out? JERRY  Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out? GEORGE  I'd like to be able to get it out.  JERRY  I think you'll get it out. GEORGE  What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.  JERRY  She's got a fine cheek. GEORGE  Is there a pinkish hue? JERRY  A pinkish hue? GEORGE  Yes, a rosy glow. JERRY  There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows. GEORGE  Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that. JERRY  I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.   Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia. CYNTHIA  Has he ever been married? ELAINE  No. CYNTHIA  Has he been close? ELAINE  He once spent a weekend with a woman.  CYNTHIA  He didn't really try to poison his boss?  ELAINE  Yeah, he did.  The next day, George is back at Jerry's. GEORGE  We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber? JERRY  I think it's tamber. GEORGE  Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice? JERRY  I didn't notice the voice. GEORGE  It's mellifluous! JERRY  So, Saturday night. GEORGE  She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.  Elaine enters. ELAINE  Hi. GEORGE  Hey! Saturday night! ELAINE  I know! GEORGE  So, what did she say? ELAINE  She said you're getting together Saturday night!  GEORGE  That's it? ELAINE  Yeah! GEORGE  She didn't mention anything about the conversation?  ELAINE  No. GEORGE  Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?  ELAINE  What? JERRY  She could have mentioned the conversation.  GEORGE  Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.   Kramer enters. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  You know my friend, Bob Sacamano? JERRY  Oh, the guy from Jersey? KRAMER  Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross. GEORGE  What are you gonna do with all of them?  KRAMER  Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.  JERRY  No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.  KRAMER  Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.  ELAINE  Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.  GEORGE  I'll take one. It's possible.  Mid-episode monologue.  The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have like a secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) he puts them in the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving cream, your little toothpaste, you know, \"How are you today?\" (nods) \"Have a nice day.\" \"You too.\"  Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's date to end.  JERRY  So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do? ELAINE  I think they went out to dinner. JERRY  Wait, I got another call. That must be him. (clicks over) Hello?  GEORGE  Yeah, it's me, I just got home. JERRY  Oh, hold on. (clicks back) It's George, he just got home.  ELAINE  Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.  JERRY  Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.  ELAINE  Remember our pact. Full disclosure.  JERRY  Of course. (clicks back to George) Yeah, go ahead.  GEORGE  Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine. JERRY  You can tell me, I'll vault it. GEORGE  It's in the vault? JERRY  I'm locking the vault. What? GEORGE  We had sex. JERRY  Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?  GEORGE  I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.  JERRY  At your apartment? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  She didn't stay over? GEORGE  No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.  Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia. ELAINE  Oh my god. CYNTHIA  He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would   perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious. ELAINE  So? How was it? CYNTHIA  How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.  ELAINE  Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.  CYNTHIA  Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.  ELAINE  Yeah, ok. (clicks over) Hello? JERRY  So, what did she have to say? ELAINE  What did he have to say? JERRY  He said they had a good time. ELAINE  Her too. JERRY  Oh, good. ELAINE  Anything else? JERRY  Nope. You? ELAINE  Nope. JERRY  You sure? ELAINE  Yup. You? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.  JERRY  Yeah. Okay then. ELAINE  Alright. Goodnight. JERRY  Goodnight.  Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment. GEORGE  I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.  JERRY  Well, I'm gonna do something about this.  GEORGE  What are you gonna do? JERRY  Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this. GEORGE  I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.  JERRY  I'm gonna call her. GEORGE  No, don't call her. JERRY  No, I'm calling her. GEORGE  No, Jerry, don't call. JERRY  No, forget it, I'm gonna call. GEORGE  I don't want you to call. JERRY  Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.  GEORGE  Give me the phone! JERRY  George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?  GEORGE  Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!  Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight. KRAMER  Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!  JERRY  I'll just call her when you leave!  GEORGE  You can't do that, it's none of your business!  JERRY  It is so my business! KRAMER  Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you! GEORGE  But tell him to give me the-- KRAMER  Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it? GEORGE  No. JERRY  Yeah, but-- KRAMER  Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They   play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.  JERRY  But Kramer-- KRAMER  Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.  Jerry and George shake hands. KRAMER  Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.  GEORGE  What? KRAMER  Right. GEORGE  Defective?! KRAMER  Defective. GEORGE  How could you give me a defective condom?!  KRAMER  I didn't even know they were defective.   Jerry gets between them to break up the fight. KRAMER  Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.  GEORGE  What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!  JERRY  Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!  Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia. CYNTHIA  I missed my period. ELAINE  Oh my god. CYNTHIA  I am very worried, I am never late.  ELAINE  But he used a condom, right? CYNTHIA  I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.  ELAINE  Oh no. CYNTHIA  What? ELAINE  Was it blue? CYNTHIA  Yeah. How'd you know? ELAINE  Just a hunch.  Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda. JERRY  Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!   Elaine walks in and give him a funny look. JERRY  Oh, hi. Soda? ELAINE  No thanks. JERRY  So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls? ELAINE  Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her. JERRY  Oh, I know her. I know her type. ELAINE  Her type? What type? JERRY  The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you! ELAINE  You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!  JERRY  I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.  ELAINE  She's not bitter! JERRY  Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!  ELAINE  Twisted? God, I did you a favor. JERRY  I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me? ELAINE  Are you calling me a liar? JERRY  I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?  ELAINE  Are you? JERRY  Get your finger out of my face. ELAINE  You get yours out, I was here first!  JERRY  I don't care. ELAINE  Get it out!  Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap fight, and gets in the middle. KRAMER  Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work. ELAINE  I knew those condoms were defective!  JERRY  How did you know they were defective?!   George walks in. ELAINE  Because! Because she missed her period!  GEORGE  She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!  George rushes out, hysterical.  Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant. CYNTHIA  So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless. ELAINE  Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.  CYNTHIA  I said to him, \"I really appreciate this, but I just got my period.\" And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--  George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping. ELAINE  Hi! GEORGE  Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.  ELAINE  What happened? JERRY  Acting. ELAINE  Very mature. JERRY  Thank you. Hi Cynthia. CYNTHIA  Hi. JERRY  Well this is a great place to sit you got here.  CYNTHIA  Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen. GEORGE  Stop it, stop it. JERRY  So what are these? ELAINE  Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.   George stars eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. You get the idea that the relationship has just ended. GEORGE  This is good. Oh, this is good.  (Comedy club)  Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now, you're playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people up. He fixed up Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, \"She's nice. She's very free about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going out with a snake, I think that's over though.\"      THE END>",

        "text": "  THE BOYFRIEND PT 1 Written by       Larry David &amp; Larry Levin   (Comedy club)  To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.   (Gym Locker Room) KRAMER  Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball. GEORGE  Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.  JERRY  I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker. GEORGE  Oh I'm a chucker. JERRY  That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.  GEORGE  I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!  JERRY  You chuck. GEROGE  Kramer am I a chucker? KRAMER  You're a chucker. GEORGE  All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?  JERRY  Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.  KRAMER  Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.

GEORGE  Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.  JERRY  well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.  GEORGE  He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.  JERRY  So? GEORGE  What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball! JERRY  I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.  GEORGE  What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.  KEITH  Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy. JERRY  Really? KEITH  I've always wanted to do what you do.  JERRY  What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time  GEORGE  Mine too. KEITH  I love that bit about Jimmy Olson JERRY  Thank you. GEORGE  You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...  KEITH  (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?  JERRY  I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.  GEORGE  But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out. KEITH  You know, I live on the East Side.  JERRY  I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call,   tell me whenever you want to go. KEITH  or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee  JERRY  Oh. that would be great. GEORGE  Uh, it's only a matter of time. KEITH  Who's this chucker?  ---  (Monks) JERRY  It's been three days and he hasn't called.  ELAINE  Well maybe you should call him. JERRY  I can't ... I can't ELAINE  Why not? JERRY  I don't know. I just feel he should call me.  ELAINE  What's the difference? JERRY  You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants   to see me he has my number, he should call. ELAINE  Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.  JERRY  I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that? ELAINE  I'm sorry honey. JERRY  I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him. ELAINE  No, JERRY  Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?  ELAINE  I know. JERRY  What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.  ELAINE  Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to   call. JERRY  Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!  ELAINE  You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?  JERRY  Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy? ELAINE  Why don't you just go ahead and call him?  JERRY  I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him? ELAINE  Just ask him if he wants a to get together.  JERRY  For what dinner? ELAINE  Dinner's good. JERRY  Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off? ELAINE  Jerry, He's A GUY! JERRY  ... this is all .. very confusing.   STAND UP  =========  When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're not interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not interested in seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the food. They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a lot of potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're a kid, you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's my friend, they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump up and down on my bed.

JERRY  Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling   us to see the baby. JERRY  (imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi...   Can't they just send us a tape? ELAINE  You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it. JERRY  uh uh because then it would be all grown up.  ELAINE  yeah ha ha ha JERRY  Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?  KRAMER  (does a double take) It's too busy  ELAINE  It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself. KRAMER  What guy? JERRY  I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.  KRAMER  Who are you talkin about? JERRY  Uh, Keith uh Hernandez. KRAMER  KEITH HERNANDEZ? NEWMAN  (enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?  (In cab) GEORGE  Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.  (changes lanes) GEORGE  You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other   lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light - CABBY  That's it GET OUT!! GEORGE  Get out? CABBY  Get out of my cab. GEORGE  Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab   (Cabby gets out) GEORGE  No, no! You can't throw me out  (Wrestling in cab)  (Jerry's Apartment) JERRY  Hellooo Newman. KRAMER  I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.  NEWMAN  I despise him. ELAINE  Why? NEWMAN  Why? I'll tell you why... KRAMER  Let me tell it .. NEWMAN  No, you can't tell it .. KRAMER  You always tell it .. NEWMAN  All right, tell it. KRAMER  Ja ja ja - just tell it NEWMAN  June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game. KRAMER  Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... (cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!) ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, \" Nice game pretty boy.\". Keith continued past us up the ramp. NEWMAN  A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward. ELAINE  What was it? KRAMER  He spit on us.... and I screamed out, \"I'm hit!\"  NEWMAN  Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.  ELAINE  Wow! What a story. JERRY  Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise   of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times. JERRY  Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.  (THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM SCENE IN THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!)  NEWMAN  Well that's the way it happened. JERRY  What happened to your head when you got hit?  KRAMER  Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left  JERRY  Again KRAMER  Back and to the left JERRY  Back and to the left Back and to the left  ELAINE  So, what are you saying? JERRY  I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward. ELAINE  So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.  JERRY  But that is not what they would have you believe.  NEWMAN  I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)  KRAMER  Wait, wait, (Exits) JERRY  The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.   (George runs in) GEORGE  (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandaley industries?  JERRY  No. What happened to you? GEORGE  Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandaley Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer \"Vanadaley Industries\". JERRY  I'm Vanadaley Industries? GEORGE  Right. JERRY  And what is that? GEORGE  You're in latex JERRY  Latex? And what do I do with latex?  GEORGE  Ya manufacture it. ELAINE  Here in this little apartment? JERRY  And what do I say about you? GEORGE  You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.  JERRY  I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?  GEORGE  Right. JERRY  I don't think so. Why would I do that?  GEORGE  Because I asked you to. JERRY  If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers   around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.  (Buzzer) JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  It's Keith. JERRY  All right we're coming down. GEORGE  KEITH HERNANDEZ:? JERRY  Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go. GEORGE  Where are you goin? ELAINE  He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter.   But who was it? Who had the motive? JERRY  That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.  GEORGE  What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)   (Keith's car) JERRY  Well that was really fun, thanks. KEITH  Yeah, it really was. JERRY  Should I shake his hand? JERRY  Well, ... KEITH  UH, do you want to catch a movie this weekend? Have you seen JFK?  JERRY  No, I haven't. JERRY  This weekend. WOW! JERRY  Sure, that would be great.

KEITH  Would you mind if I gave her a call?  JERRY  For a date? KEITH  Yeah. JERRY  Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?  KEITH  You sure you don't mind? JERRY  .... (silence)  (Jerry's Apartment) JERRY  So then we went to dinner. GEORGE  Who paid? JERRY  We split it. GEORGE  Split it. Pretty good. Talk about game six?  JERRY  Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.   (Buzzer) JERRY  Yeah ELAINE  It's Elaine. JERRY  Come on up. GEORGE  So then what? JERRY  Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.  GEORGE  Shake his hand? JERRY  (smiling) Yeah GEORGE  What kind of a shake does he have?  JERRY  Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.  GEORGE  So, uh, you gonna see him again? JERRY  He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.  GEORGE  Wow! The weekend. JERRY  So then as I was getting out of the car, ...  ELAINE  HI JERRY  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  Sooo, how was your date?

They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.  GEORGE  Hate those couples. I could never bee one of those couples. There are no bald   woman around. You know? JERRY  You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that. GEORGE  You know what I would like to do? I would really like to have sex with a tall woman. I mean really tall. Like a like a giant Like six five.  JERRY  Really? GEORGE  What was the tallest woman you ever slept with?  JERRY  I don't know ... six three. GEORGE  Wow, ... god! You see this is all I think about. Sleeping with a giant. It's my   life's ambition. JERRY  So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people. GEORGE  Magellan? You like Magellan? JERRY  Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.  GEORGE  Who do you like? GEORGE  I like DeSoto. JERRY  DeSoto? What did he do? GEORGE  Discovered the Mississippi.

JERRY  No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment   at three. I'm helping him move. GEORGE  What? The guy asked you to HELP HIM MOVE? Wow.  JERRY  I know isn't that something? KRAMER  He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?  JERRY  I don't know ... he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break   something. GEORGE  The next thing you know, he'll have you driving him to the airport..  JERRY  I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!   (New York State Department of lab or) GEORGE  I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough   for her. MRS. SOKOL  Sign here please. GEORGE  Ha, I don't know who she's looking for. I don't know. I'll tell you something.   She's very particular, your daughter. Very particular. What is she looking for some big hot shot businessman? Well I've got my pride too. I'm not going to beg her.  MRS. SOKOL  All right just sign it. People are waiting.  GEORGE  You, uh, you like baseball? (picks up baseball from desk)  MRS. SOKOL  That was autographed by the '86 Mets. I saw every inning that year.  GEORGE  Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.  MRS. SOKOL  You know Keith Hernandez. GEORGE  Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?  MRS. SOKOL  Oh, come on. Come on. GEORGE  I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.  MRS. SOKOL  All right. You got ONE hour. GEORGE  All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.

(same cabby stares at him) GEORGE  Goodbye (exits cab)  (Jerry's Apartment) KEITH  Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed. JERRY  Is there a box spring? KEITH  What's that? JERRY  Is there a box spring? KEITH  Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take   that apart. Then we got the couch. JERRY  Is that a sectional? KEITH  Yeah. Twelve pieces. (not clear) ...coffee table.  JERRY  Is that a thick marble?  (... Jerry and Keith start to laugh and Jerry walks behind Keith so they don't make eye contact and break up) KEITH  Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the   convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs. JERRY  STAIRS??? There's no elevator? KEITH  Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.  JERRY  I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.  (Kramer enters, sees Keith and does a double take) KRAMER  Hello. KEITH  Hello. KRAMER  Oh, you don't remember me. KEITH  No should I (continuity error: in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game)  KRAMER  Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.   (Newman enters) NEWMAN  June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the   game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp. KEITH  YOU said, \"Nice game, pretty boy.\"  KRAMER  Ah, you remember. NEWMAN  And then you spit on us. KEITH  Hey, I didn't spit at you. NEWMAN  Oh, yeah, right. KRAMER  No no no, well, then who was it? KEITH  Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was   walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. ... Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way. JERRY  I told you! NEWMAN  Wow, it was McDowell. JERRY  But why? Why McDowell? KRAMER  Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game. NEWMAN  He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.  NEWMAN  It was McDowell. KRAMER  Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.  NEWMAN  Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.  KEITH  look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.  KRAMER  Wait, uh what are ya' doing? KEITH  I gotta move. KRAMER  Want any help? KEITH  I'd love some. KRAMER  I'd love to help you move. NEWMAN  Me too. KEITH  Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile   We're going to have to handle it like a baby. KRAMER  No sweat.  (they exit)  (phone rings) JERRY  Hello, ... oh hi Elaine .. what's going on ... no he just left ... you broke up   with him? ... ME TOO .. what happened? ... oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope ... me ... nah ... I couldn't go through with it ... I just didn't feel ready ... so what are you doing now? ... Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.  (George frantically enters) GEORGE  Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?  JERRY  You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?  GEORGE  (out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you   to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend ... the guy from the locker room, ... I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.   (sits down) JERRY  Well Biff/ What's next? GEORGE  I don't know.  (Tall girl enters) TALL GIRL  Excuse me. I was walking behind you and you dropped your wallet.   (Comedy club)  When You're moving your whole world becomes boxes. That's all you think about is boxes. Boxes, where are there boxes? You just wander down the street going in and out of stores. Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes? I mean it's all you think about. You can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. Shut up I'm looking for boxes. Just after a while you become like really into it you can smell them. You walk into a store. There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have boxes. Dammit, I can SMELL them. I'm like I'm obsessed. I love the smell of cardboard in the morning. You could be at a funeral. Everyone's mourning crying around, and your looking at the casket. That's a nice box Does anyone know where that guy got that box? When he's done with it do you think I could get that? it's got some nice handles on it. And that's what death is really. It's the last big move of your life. The hearse is like the van. The pale bearers are your close friends the only ones you could ask to help you with a big move like that. and the casket is that great perfect box you've been waiting for your whole life The only problem is, once you find it you're in it.

Or do you think they just feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You don't like it; go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals, the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating that you're taking on the tuna.  George is at the airport. GEORGE  It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?  The woman walks away. George addresses the man standing on the other side.  GEORGE  Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?  MAN  There's a clock over there. GEORGE  Where? MAN  There. GEORGE  But you have a watch on. MAN  It's right by the escalator. GEORGE  Why don't you just look at your watch?  MAN  I told you, it's right over there.  GEORGE  Let me see the watch.  George grabs the man's wrist. MAN  Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!  GEORGE  You know we're living in a society!   Jerry walks up from the ramp. JERRY  George. GEORGE  Jerry. Jerry. JERRY  Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?  GEORGE  I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.   Jerry, Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.  GEORGE  One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.  JERRY  So you have no car? GEORGE  No. JERRY  So what good are you?  Jerry looks over towards a chauffer holding a sign that says O'BRIEN  JERRY  I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up. GEORGE  How do you know? JERRY  He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.  GEORGE  We should take his limo. JERRY  Yeah, right. GEORGE  Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago. JERRY  He's definitely in Chicago. GEORGE  Well the guy's just standing there.  JERRY  How would we do it? GEORGE  We just go up to him, we say, \"We're O'Brien.\"  JERRY  Maybe he knows O'Brien? GEORGE  No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it. JERRY  What if we get caught? GEORGE  What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.  JERRY  Who's gonna be O'Brien? GEORGE  I'll be O'Brien. JERRY  Who am I? GEORGE  You're you. JERRY  Just me? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Okay. GEORGE  What, you don't want to be you? JERRY  Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?  GEORGE  Like who? JERRY  Dylan Murphy.  George mumbles something. JERRY  What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?  GEORGE  Well I like Dylan. JERRY  You could be Colin. GEORGE  Colin O'Brien. JERRY  I'm Dylan Murphy. GEORGE  I'm Colin O'Brien.  They walk towards the chauffer. GEORGE  Are we really doing this? JERRY  Come on, MAN  Hey, do you have the time? GEORGE  Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.  CHAUFFER  Yes sir. GEORGE  Sorry we're late. CHAUFFER  Here let me take that for you. GEORGE  Oh thank you. CHAUFFER  I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.  GEORGE  Thank you very much. Dylan? JERRY  Colin?  George and Jerry are in the back of a limo. George is giddy with excitement.  GEORGE  This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother. JERRY  What for? GEORGE  I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!! JERRY  She happy for you? GEORGE  Can he hear us? JERRY  No. Why? GEORGE  I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.  JERRY  He can't hear us. GEORGE  Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.  JERRY  Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house? GEORGE  We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us? CHAUFFER  Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.  GEORGE  Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to   Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight! JERRY  What? GEORGE  We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!  JERRY  We're going to the Knick game! GEORGE  Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?! JERRY  I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!  GEORGE  You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things? JERRY  Lemme call Elaine and Kramer. GEORGE  If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'  JERRY  Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right babydoll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.  CHAUFFER  I know. JERRY AND GEORGE  He knows? GEORGE  Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?  JERRY  Maybe it's a shortcut. GEORGE  We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.  JERRY  (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?  CHAUFFER  Pick up the other members of your party.  GEORGE  Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up. JERRY  It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.  GEORGE  It was a good jig. JERRY  It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien. GEORGE  There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.  JERRY  First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.  GEORGE  Well you should have been O'Brien.  JERRY  I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?  GEORGE  Yes, you have to be Murphy. JERRY  It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.  GEORGE  You're Murphy! JERRY  I'm Seinfeld! GEORGE  You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.  JERRY  We're doing sixty miles an hour! GEORGE  So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.  JERRY  Who are you, Mannix? GEORGE  We're slowing down. Are those the people?  JERRY  Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.   The limo pulls over, two people, a man (Tim) and a woman (Eva), get in.  WOMAN  Mr. O'Brien? JERRY  No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.  EVA  Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter. JERRY  Newsletter? TIM  And of course, his great book, \"The Game\".  JERRY  Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before? EVA  No. JERRY  Never seen a picture of him? EVA  Never. JERRY  Not even on the book jacket? EVA  There was no picture on the book jacket.  JERRY  Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.  GEORGE  Hello. I'm O'Brien.  Elaine meets Kramer of Jerry's corner. KRAMER  Hey! ELAINE  Hey! KRAMER  What, you took a cab? ELAINE  Yeah? So? KRAMER  How much do you make? ELAINE  I'm not telling you. KRAMER  C'mon. ELAINE  No! KRAMER  I'll tell you how much I make. ELAINE  I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball. KRAMER  You ever seen Michael Jordan? ELAINE  Just in those commercials. KRAMER  Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.  ELAINE  What's that? KRAMER  Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.  ELAINE  Huh? KRAMER  Yeah.  Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a bunch of garbage cans.  Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo. JERRY  I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.  TIM  You think someone's been tipped off?  GEORGE  So, um, you've read \"The Big Game\", have you?  EVA  Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.  GEORGE  Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of \"The Big Game\". EVA  Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you   analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man. GEORGE  Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.  TIM  Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.  GEORGE  Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.  JERRY  He tends to exaggerate. GEORGE  Okay, I mean it's serious but-- EVA  We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.  GEORGE  Uh, my speech? EVA  Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?  JERRY  Well you might as well look it over.   Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner. KRAMER  So what's going on, how did all this happen?  ELAINE  Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going   to the Knicks-Bulls game. KRAMER  Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.  ELAINE  He did. KRAMER  Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?  ELAINE  I don't know. KRAMER  That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?  ELAINE  Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy. KRAMER  O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?   Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.  GEORGE  ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities. JERRY  You're not going to open with that, are you?  EVA  What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?  GEORGE  I said so many things.  Suddenly they hear a loud bang. GEORGE  They're shooting! They're shooting!  TIM  Alright, get down!  The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, Eva has fallen on top of George.  Eva. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you. GEORGE  That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.  EVA  But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.   Tim returns. TIM  Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're   prepared to handle anything that might come up.  Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling it sensually. JERRY  Nice looking Lugar.  Jodi Baskerville, reporting live. JODI  I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden   where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.  Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner. KRAMER  Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?  A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized Elaine. DAN  Elaine? ELAINE  Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you? DAN  Good. ELAINE  Um, oh, this is um, Kramer. DAN  Oh, Kramer?  They shake hands. ELAINE  What's going on? DAN  Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.  ELAINE  Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.  DAN  Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.  ELAINE  Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.  DAN  Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time   he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.  KRAMER  Who? DAN  The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.   Cut back to the limo.  Jerry and George are alone inside. JERRY  What's taking him so long out there?  GEORGE  Didja see the way she was looking at me?  JERRY  She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi! GEORGE  I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.  JERRY  Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?  GEORGE  I don't know. JERRY  Let's just make a run for it. GEORGE  I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.  JERRY  How'd that happen? GEORGE  I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real   tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it. JERRY  I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that. GEORGE  For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.   George grabs the phone and dials. GEORGE  9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--  Tim re-enters the limo. GEORGE  --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.  TIM  We'll be ready in a minute. GEORGE  Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something. TIM  With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.  GEORGE  Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?  TIM  You are. GEORGE  And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again? TIM  You are. GEORGE  Good. I think you forgot something.  TIM  I'm sorry. GEORGE  Good. Now get out.  Tim leaves. GEORGE  Okay, what are we gonna do? JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see   Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.  JERRY  Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.   Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner. KRAMER  I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.  ELAINE  I'm sure he was just joking around.  KRAMER  Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!  ELAINE  What is it? KRAMER  Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union! ELAINE  Jerry's a nazi?! KRAMER  I can't believe I didn't see it. ELAINE  Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.  KRAMER  You don't think so. ELAINE  No, he's just neat.  Cut back to the limo. TIM  You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.  GEORGE  Me??  George and Jerry laugh nervously. TIM  And you really don't look like a Murphy.  JERRY  I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.  GEORGE  He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.  TIM  Where are you from? JERRY  Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat. TIM  Sounds more like Scottish. JERRY  We were right on the border.  Cut back to the street corner. KRAMER  Maybe he's with the company. ELAINE  What? KRAMER  The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within. ELAINE  What about his comedy act? KRAMER  That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.  ELAINE  What about George? KRAMER  What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy! ELAINE  I'll bet they were even in on it. KRAMER  Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna. ELAINE  Kramer, you're hurting me!  Quick cut to the now approaching limo. GEORGE  Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over. ELAINE  Get off of me!!  The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out. KRAMER  O'Brien.  This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby bus stop. MAN  O'Brien? Is that him? MAN #2  Yeah, that's him. MAN #3  Look there's O'Brien! MAN #4  Filthy nazi bastard! ALL FOUR  Let's get him!!  They begin running full speed towards the gang. GEORGE  What do I do?! What do I do?! JERRY  Get in the car! Get in the car!  George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off.  KRAMER  O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?  TIM  Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?  JERRY  No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.  ELAINE  It could be very confusing.  The limo phone rings Kramer answers it. KRAMER  Yeah? Eva? EVA  It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.  KRAMER  O'Brien? Well that's weird. EVA  Who are you?  George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car broke down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.  Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live. JODI  A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of   protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.  Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of the three are intelligible at this point. JODI  They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.  Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming unnerved. EVA  Get out!! ELAINE  Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan! DAN  Elaine? ELAINE  Hey!  Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'. GEORGE  I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!  (Comedy club)  So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie and there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies always had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they would do and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil, remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how are ya, is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the copier? Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, nice to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?     THE END>",

        "text": "  THE GOOD SAMARITAN Written by  Peter Mehlman   (Jerry is driving alone talking on his car phone to Elaine at home in her bed) ELAINE  You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker? JERRY  It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.   (Driver cuts in front of Jerry) JERRY  Oh look at this guy. ELAINE  What's goin' on? JERRY  Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in. ELAINE  Did you get a thank you wave? JERRY  No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?  (Jerry sticks his head out the window) JERRY  Give me that wave! ELAINE  Jerry, are you free on Friday? JERRY  Yeah, I'm free, why? ELAINE  Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband. JERRY  Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block! ELAINE  You gotta follow that car! JERRY  What?! ELAINE  You can't let him get away with that!  JERRY  Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.  ELAINE  What are you, yellow? JERRY  I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)  ELAINE  Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.  JERRY  Wait, he stopped, he's parking. ELAINE  What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?   (Scene moves outside where Jerry get out of his car to confront other driver, who as they come out of their car, is an attractive woman)  JERRY  Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering. (They both smile flirtatiously at each other)  (Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry and George are talking by the table) JERRY  So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.  GEORGE  Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.  JERRY  You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.  (Reaches out to touch Georges arm to demonstrate) JERRY  He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)  GEORGE  I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that? JERRY  Let's not even analyze it.  (Jerry begins walking towards door) GEORGE  So you didn't turn her in? JERRY  I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.  GEORGE  Gonna see her again? JERRY  Friday night.  (Intercom buzzes, Jerry presses the button) JERRY  Yep. ELAINE  It's me! JERRY  Come on up.  (Jerry unlocks and opens door) JERRY  By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.  GEORGE  Hey, hey, hey! I dig.  (George walks into kitchen and opens cupboard to get cups) JERRY  Oh, you dig? GEORGE  Yes! I see enormous potential here.  JERRY  Why?  (George pours two cups of milk) GEORGE  Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story. JERRY  I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.  GEORGE  I don't think so. JERRY  Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!   (Jerry takes a drink of his milk while both remain silent) JERRY  On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!  (Jerry looks at his cup in disgust) JERRY  What am I drinking, milk?  (Elaine enters, hanging up her jacket) ELAINE  Hey! JERRY  Hi.  (Elaine tosses a sweater to Jerry) ELAINE  Sweater. JERRY  Thank you. ELAINE  So? What happened?  (Jerry starts walking away) JERRY  With that? ELAINE  With the car! JERRY  What car? ELAINE  The hit and run! JERRY  Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens. ELAINE  Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?  JERRY  Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)   (George walks out of the kitchen) GEORGE  Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.  JERRY  Yeah, Queens. ELAINE  So? Then what? JERRY  So he gets out of the car, I say, \"Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!\" So he says to me, \"What are ya gonna do about it?\"  (Elaine gasps) JERRY  So I said to him, \"Whatever's necessary.\"   (Elaine stutters with her mouth open in amazement) ELAINE  I am speechless. I am without speech.  GEORGE  Tell her about the shoving. JERRY  What?  (George smiles pointing at him) ELAINE  What shoving?! JERRY  Oh, it was nothing. GEORGE  No! Tell her.  (Jerry looks at George with a grin) JERRY  Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches) ELAINE  You know karate?? JERRY  I know a little. ELAINE  Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did he do?  JERRY  He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey! (Group does likewise) ELAINE  Did you tell Kramer? JERRY  Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)  KRAMER  What? What? What? Tell me. ELAINE  Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.   (Jerry looks at Kramer and raises both his arms smiling) KRAMER  Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry) KRAMER  They should be sent to Australia.  (Jerry has a confused look) JERRY  Australia? KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.  JERRY  But not any more. KRAMER  No.  (Everyone pauses and looks at Kramer) ELAINE  Hey Kramer, Kramer! KRAMER  Yeah? ELAINE  What happened to you right here? (She's pointing to her forehead)  KRAMER  I don't know!  (Jerry smiles and shakes his head) KRAMER  You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.   (Elaine has a look of surprise) ELAINE  Well, that is, that is strange. KRAMER  Yep. (Mumbles off)  (Elaine walks toward door) ELAINE  Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?  JERRY  Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.   (Elaine closes door and walks back toward Jerry) ELAINE  But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)  JERRY  We just met.  (Kramer is tapping his temple with his finger) KRAMER  Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.  ELAINE  But I, I can't go alone! JERRY  Ask George to go with you. ELAINE  George, come on! I'll pay for you.  GEORGE  You'll pay? I'm there. JERRY  Why do you even need anybody? ELAINE  Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)  (Scene moves to restaurant with Elaine, George, and the married couple, Michael and Robin, sitting down talking, George is mainly focused on eating his meal) ROBIN  You went out with a bullfighter? ELAINE  Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now. MICHAEL  Wow. ROBIN  What was his name? ELAINE  His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.   (George points across the table) GEORGE  Pass the salt please. ROBIN  Where did you meet him? ELAINE  Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.  (Elaine and couple laugh, George points at the bread) GEORGE  Bread.  (Elaine hands bread to George) ELAINE  I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.  (Robin sneezes, no one says anything, George lifts his head and looks at Michael) GEORGE  God bless you.  (Robin smiles) ROBIN  Thank you. GEORGE  I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)  (Michael stops pouring wine and looks seriously at George)  (Scene moves to Jerry's car, where Jerry and hit-and-run woman are both eating an ice cream cones) WOMAN  You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.  JERRY  Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.  WOMAN  Did you ever see Zorba the Greek? JERRY  Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.  (Woman touches Jerry's hair, smiling) WOMAN  Come here.  (Scene moves back to restaurant where an argument has developed between Michael and George) GEORGE  Really, I was, I was only kidding around.  ROBIN  He was only joking Michael.  (Michael throws down his serviette) MICHAEL  You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?  GEORGE  No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special. ROBIN  He was only joking Michael! Sorry.  MICHAEL  All right! Take his side! ROBIN  I am not taking his side. MICHAEL  Well who's side are you taking?! ROBIN  Well I'm not taking your side!  (Robin sneezes, George gestures to Michael that the floor is his)   (Scene moves back to Jerry's car, where Jerry and the hit-and-run woman are now kissing) JERRY  Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.  (Woman pulls Jerry back in and starts kissing him again)  (Scene moves back to Jerry apartment with George talking outside Jerry room, where Jerry is) GEORGE  I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?  JERRY  The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.  (George makes a confused look. The intercom buzzes, Jerry walks over and presses the button) ELAINE  It's me. JERRY  Come on up.  (Jerry unlocks door, conversation moves into kitchen) GEORGE  Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs. JERRY  No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.  GEORGE  Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single. JERRY  What if she's having an off night?   (Elaine walks in, Jerry goes to sit down on sofa) ELAINE  Hi!  Jerry. Hi.  (Elaine takes her coat off and walks into kitchen) ELAINE  Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!   (George walks out of kitchen) GEORGE  Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.  (Jerry sneezes) GEORGE  Ah, shut up. ELAINE  What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.  (Elaine sits on sofa, George sits on arm of sofa) JERRY  A stupid what?  (Elaine looks at Jerry) ELAINE  Whatever. JERRY  You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.  (Elaine nods, George rolls his eyes) ELAINE  Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her. GEORGE  Who? ELAINE  Robin!  (George looks quickly at Elaine) GEORGE  Why?! ELAINE  Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.   (George stands up) JERRY  Entertainment Tonight's on. GEORGE  Where's the remote phone? JERRY  Bedroom.  (George walks toward Jerry's bedroom) ELAINE  Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?   (Theme music plays on TV, Kramer walks in, waves at Jerry and Elaine, then walks over to Jerry's bookshelf, dancing to the music. Voice of Mary Hart starts on TV and Kramer starts having a wild seizure behind the sofa.)  JERRY  What's it like out?  (Kramer continues to shake behind sofa) ELAINE  Chilly out. JERRY  Can I take a sweater? ELAINE  Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.  JERRY  Scarf? ELAINE  Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.   (Jerry and Elaine finally notice Kramer as he finishes) JERRY  What's the matter? What's going on?   (Kramer is looking around like he's lost) KRAMER  What happened?! ELAINE  What? KRAMER  I think I hit my head again! JERRY  What is wrong?!  (Elaine is pointing at the TV) ELAINE  Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV? KRAMER  Yeah.  (Elaine claps her hands together then stands up) ELAINE  That is it! KRAMER  What?  (Elaine walks toward Kramer pointing her finger at him) ELAINE  That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!  (George walks out of Jerry's bedroom toward kitchen, Kramer sits down)  KRAMER  Mary Hart! GEORGE  God. ELAINE  What? GEORGE  Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon. JERRY  Get together? GEORGE  Maybe she just wants to talk to me?  ELAINE  Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.   (George walks to other side of sofa) GEORGE  Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.  (George sits on chair) ELAINE  Are you actually considering this?  GEORGE  I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!  ELAINE  Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.  (Jerry moves around sofa as if uncomfortable) JERRY  Yeah.  (Kramer walks out of washroom) KRAMER  Hey, you know who owns that car? JERRY  What car? KRAMER  The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.  JERRY  Yeah who? KRAMER  That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.  (Jerry stands up and walks toward kitchen) JERRY  The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.   (Elaine nods, smiling) ELAINE  Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.   (Elaine walks out door, Kramer follows) KRAMER  Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?   (Jerry closes door behind them, then runs over to George very excited)  JERRY  The blond with the blue sweatpants!  GEORGE  Well, who is she? JERRY  I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.  GEORGE  Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.  (Jerry sits down, disgruntled, flips aimlessly through a magazine)  JERRY  Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!  (Jerry and George are both pointing their fingers at each other)  GEORGE  You can't compromise your principles!  JERRY  How am I going to live with myself?!  GEORGE  Can't live! JERRY  I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!  GEORGE  This country needs more people like you!  JERRY  Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk. GEORGE  I believe strongly in that as you know.  JERRY  There should be more people like us.  GEORGE  That's why the world's in the shape it's in.  JERRY  You're telling me.  (Jerry and George both flip pages simultaneously and start reading their magazines)  (Scene moves to apartment across street, where Jerry is talking to the girl with the blue sweatpants, Becky Gelke, outside her door) JERRY  Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.  (Becky touches Jerry's arm, smiling) BECKY  Well God bless you.  (Jerry pauses) JERRY  Thank you very much.  (Scene moves to George's apartment, where George and Robin are together in bed) GEORGE  Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?  ROBIN  Oh no, what's wrong? GEORGE  What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!  ROBIN  You didn't commit adultery, I did.  GEORGE  Oh yeah. ROBIN  If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.  GEORGE  Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there. ROBIN  Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.  GEORGE  Well, that's a given. ROBIN  In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.  GEORGE  Must be hell living in that house.   (Scene moves to Elaine's apartment, where she is talking on the phone to Michael) MICHAEL  Hi, it's Michael. ELAINE  Hi, Michael! MICHAEL  Is Robin there? ELAINE  Robin? No, why? MICHAEL  Uh, she said she was going to be with you.  ELAINE  No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.  (Elaine sits on the couch and crumples newspaper into the phone)  MICHAEL  If she's not with you, then where is she?  ELAINE  Well I, I don't know. MICHAEL  Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!  ELAINE  No, no, come on Michael! MICHAEL  He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!  (Michael sneezes) ELAINE  You're soo good lookin'.  (Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment, where Jerry and Angela are talking by the sofa) ANGELA  Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue! JERRY  Let me rephra- ANGELA  I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!  (Elaine walks in) JERRY  Hi Elaine, this is Angela. ANGELA  I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!   (Jerry walks past her away from the kitchen) JERRY  Well I think I get the gist of it.  ANGELA  So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!   (Jerry shrugs) JERRY  What car?  (Jerry hands Angela her purse) ANGELA  Good. I'm glad we understand each other.  JERRY  It's not complicated.  (Angela walks out and down hall, Elaine waves) ELAINE  Very nice meeting you!  (Intercom buzzes, Elaine hits button while walking toward Jerry)  ELAINE  Come on up.  (Elaine laughs) ELAINE  Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right. JERRY  Alright Elaine. ELAINE  No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!  JERRY  It was just a couple of blocks.  (Elaine takes cup from Jerry and sets it on counter) ELAINE  Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!   (George walks in open door, and into kitchen. Elaine walks toward him, Jerry goes to washroom) GEORGE  Hey. ELAINE  Oh, did you check you machine?  (George takes glass from cupboard) GEORGE  No, why, what's happening? ELAINE  Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.  GEORGE  Yeah, okay. ELAINE  And I said I hadn't seen her. GEORGE  What?! ELAINE  No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name. GEORGE  He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!  ELAINE  He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.  GEORGE  What? Why couldn't you think of something?!  ELAINE  Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!  GEORGE  You lie! How hard is it to lie?!  (Jerry walks back from washroom) JERRY  It's not that hard.  (Elaine points finger at George) ELAINE  Well who told you to sleep with her George?!  GEORGE  It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!  ELAINE  Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'! GEORGE  Oh don't-  (Jerry raises his arms) JERRY  Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?  GEORGE  She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.  JERRY  A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name? ELAINE  Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.  (Jerry uses hand towel to mimic matador) JERRY  Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Ray's Pizza!  (Scene moves to Becky's apartment, where Jerry is talking to her outside her door) JERRY  Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage. BECKY  Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875.  JERRY  $875? BECKY  That's right. JERRY  Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.  (Jerry takes out checkbook, and start writing) JERRY  Um, who do I make it out to? BECKY  Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E. JERRY  So, what are you doing this weekend?   (Jerry hands check to Becky) BECKY  You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date? JERRY  I didn't do it! BECKY  Yeah righ-  (Becky sneezes) JERRY  You are soo good lookin'.  (Becky closes door) BECKY  Thank you.  (Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry is changing in bedroom and George is looking out window) GEORGE  Jerry, let's go! You ready?  (Jerry walks out of bedroom) JERRY  You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks! GEORGE  Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city. JERRY  Alright!  (George put his bag over his shoulder) GEORGE  Come on let's get out of here.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  How could you? JERRY  What?! KRAMER  Man! I never thought you were capable of this!  JERRY  What did I do? KRAMER  I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran. JERRY  I- KRAMER  I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building. JERRY  I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!  KRAMER  Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?   (Jerry is putting on sweater) JERRY  No, never. KRAMER  Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her. JERRY  You got a date with Becky Gelke?! KRAMER  Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.  GEORGE  Jerry, can we get out of here?! KRAMER  As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her. JERRY  Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.   (Jerry yanks coat out of George's hands)   THE END>",

I feel like I'm   getting fixed up for a friendship. JERRY  I don't know how long this is gonna last.  GEORGE  Really? I thought you liked her. JERRY  I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having   fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door) GEORGE  You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not   obligated to buy anything, am I?  (Nina opens the door) JERRY  Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.  NINA  How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)  JERRY  (walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!  KRAMER  Yeah! JERRY  (to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.  NINA  Oh, are you interested? GEORGE  (looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.  KRAMER  George, you gonna buy a painting? GEORGE  (gritting teeth) Yeah, sure. NINA  Are you an art-lover? GEORGE  I am an art-adorer! I adore art. NINA  Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like.   (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to   the painting-in-progress (Kramer) and picks up a brush.) JERRY  May I? (pantomimes making a big \"X\" across the painting)  NINA  (laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands   Jerry a small white envelope) JERRY  What's this? NINA  My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday   afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout. JERRY  (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going   out of town. NINA  Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?  KRAMER  (immediately) Yeah. JERRY  They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!  GEORGE  Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?  NINA  Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.  GEORGE  All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!  NINA  (gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-   ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one? Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being lead   to their seats) GEORGE  Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not   stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher   abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?  USHER  No, no, these are your seats. GEORGE  She said first row! Right behind the dugout!  ELAINE  Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.  GEORGE  I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up   on the dugout! ELAINE  Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than   this. GEORGE  Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right   there, that's better. KRAMER  Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer   hands out the hot dogs)What a great day! ELAINE  I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.  GEORGE  (amused) You're supposed to do that?  ELAINE  (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to   go to a circumcision? GEORGE  I'd rather go to a hanging. ELAINE  Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father   in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs) KRAMER  (screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,   JOHNNY, 'CAUSE THIS AIN'T PHILIDELPHIA!!  (a man approaches the trio) MAN  George? GEORGE  Yeah? MAN  Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.  GEORGE  Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--  ELAINE  Hi! KRAMER  (screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!  GEORGE  --and this is Kramer. KRAMER  Oh, hey.  (the Yankees make a good play, the crowd applauds) WEST  So how are the seats? GEORGE  Okay. ELAINE  Great, great. KRAMER  Yeah. WEST  George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.  GEORGE  Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs.   (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it? WEST  Well, if you have a lot of money.  (Yankees make a horrible play, the crowd responds) WEST  (leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you   better take off that Orioles cap. ELAINE  (thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!  WEST  No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't   think it's a good idea. ELAINE  You're not serious. WEST  Yes, yes, yes, I am! ELAINE  Well, did he say that? WEST  No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if   you wore an Orioles cap. ELAINE  Well maybe you should ask him! WEST  I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or   not? ELAINE  No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This   is ridiculous!! GEORGE  Just take the cap off. ELAINE  George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!  WEST  Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.  ELAINE  Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.  GEORGE  Just take the cap off! ELAINE  No!  (a fight starts between Elaine and George; Elaine ends up taking off   GEORGE'S hat, and throwing it onto the field... West calls security   over, they proceed to remove Elaine) KRAMER  Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!  GEORGE  (to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?  KRAMER  (getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.  ELAINE  (sarcastically, to George) Stay! GEORGE  Okay, we'll go!  (meanwhile Kramer is climbing over the dugout retrieve George's cap... the   camera cuts to the field where the batter hits a pop fly to where Kramer  IS  the ball knocks him squarely in the head, he falls off the dugout onto   the crowd)  END OF ACT 1  =============================================================================   ACT 2  (Jerry's apartment--day) ELAINE  ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over   the railing! JERRY  Is he okay? ELAINE  Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you   know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!  JERRY  This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you   to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane! ELAINE  I know! Can you imagine that?  (Kramer enters with a bandage wrapper around his forehead) JERRY  How you feeling? KRAMER  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey,   we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're   all in the picture. ELAINE  Wha- a picture? KRAMER  A picture. ELAINE  OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE?? KRAMER  Uh-huh.  (they all crowd around, looking at the picture) ELAINE  (gasps) I cannot believe this! JERRY  (pointing) There's George! KRAMER  Yup, yup! ELAINE  Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father!   Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in   the paper! Lippman's office. Lippman is at his desk, Elaine enters.)  ELAINE  Hi, Mr. Lippman. LIPPMAN  How's your father? ELAINE  My, my father? LIPPMAN  Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?  ELAINE  Yeah. LIPPMAN  Uh-huh. ELAINE  I went to visit him. LIPPMAN  Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?  ELAINE  Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...  LIPPMAN  But--but he's feeling better now? ELAINE  Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have   buoyed (Elaine says \"boyed\") his spirits. LIPPMAN  (correcting her) Boo-eed. ELAINE  What--what did I say? LIPPMAN  You said \"boyed.\" ELAINE  I did? LIPPMAN  Yeah.  (Elaine starts to laugh hysterically, and at the same time discreetly removes   Lippman's sports section from his desk. She manages to maneuver it into her   lap, out of sight.) LIPPMAN  Well, I got a plane to catch. ELAINE  Oh! Where are you going? LIPPMAN  Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have   my sports section? ELAINE  Ah. ...Yeah. LIPPMAN  I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports   section. ELAINE  There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the   Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy... LIPPMAN  Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine   holds on tight.) What, what are you doing? ELAINE  Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD   time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news-   papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs) LIPPMAN  Gotta go. ELAINE  Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat)   I'll just hold down the, uh, fort! Nina's studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are admiring Nina's \"Kramer.\")  MRS.ARM  I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an   innocent orphan in the post-modern world. MR. ARM  I see a parasite. MRS.ARM  A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his   most basic and immediate urges. Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.)  NINA  She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.  JERRY  It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap   at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that? Armstrongs admiring painting again.)  MRS.ARM  He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!  MR. ARM  He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away.  Jerry and Nina again.) JERRY  Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we   should just end this before we really start hating each other.  NINA  Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to   remain friends! JERRY  Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!  NINA  Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George.   Tell him he owes me $500! Armstrongs) MRS.ARM  He transcends time and space. MR. ARM  He sickens me. MRS.ARM  I love it. MR. ARM  Me too. Jerry's apartment.) GEORGE  Five-hundred dollars?! What? JERRY  That's what she told me! GEORGE  I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!  JERRY  That's what it costs! GEORGE  Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!  JERRY  I wasn't thinking! I don't know. GEORGE  You weren't thinking. JERRY  Well, she framed it and everything.  GEORGE  Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this!   (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly   lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this? JERRY  Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some-   thing! GEORGE  I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a   different story. KRAMER  (entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your   door. GEORGE  Hey, Kramer. KRAMER  Hi, Mike. JERRY  (looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!  KRAMER  (notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever   seen! JERRY  (reading note) Oh my god! GEORGE  What? JERRY  This is amazing, you can't believe this!  GEORGE  What's it say? JERRY  Listen to this: \"I don't know what you expect to find out there,   Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing   I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything   I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists,   because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness   and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-   ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity.\" GEORGE  WOW! KRAMER  (emotionally) She's deep. JERRY  (reading on) \"...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not   going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and   people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-\"   (Kramer blows his noes loudly) \"...because I'm sure as hell fighting   for you!\" KRAMER  You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!  JERRY  No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about   her! KRAMER  (pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a   call. Pick up the phone and call her! JERRY  Should I? KRAMER  (screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight   for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you! JERRY  ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.  Jerry's apartment, another day. Jerry is helping Nina put on her   coat. The TV is on a horse race.) JERRY  SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter-   com buzzes) Yeah? GEORGE  (on intercom) It's George. JERRY  Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love   a good posse. NINA  What's the appeal of the posse? JERRY  The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away   from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a   week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.  (George enters) NINA  Hello, George. GEORGE  Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?  NINA  Well, I really love that piece. GEORGE  Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact,   I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you!   Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know   what? On second thought, I can't even accept it. NINA  No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!  GEORGE  This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should   really be in a doormanned building. NINA  Honestly, George, the money's not important.  GEORGE  Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)  JERRY  Yeah? ELAINE  (on intercom) It's Elaine. JERRY  Come on up. NINA  Elaine? JERRY  ...Yeah. NINA  (rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?  JERRY  She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing   to George) He likes the pop-in, too. GEORGE  I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  How 'bout Kramer. JERRY  HUGE pop-in guy! NINA  Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?  JERRY  Yeah. NINA  Okay. JERRY  Okay! NINA  Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)  ELAINE  (to Nina) Hello!  (Nina doesn't respond, just walks past Elaine) ELAINE  (sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll   be fired! JERRY  If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!  ELAINE  No, he wants to torture me. later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.   Jerry, with the remote, is furiously flipping through channels.)  ELAINE  (annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the   clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, insti-   gating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)  JERRY  (tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back)   Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking. ELAINE  You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never   seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.   (another tug-o-war starts) JERRY  Let go! ELAINE  No, come on! I want it, Jerry! JERRY  Let go, Elaine! ELAINE  Well at least let George do it! JERRY  Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)  GEORGE  (as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally   gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.  (George starts clicking, the first station he lands on is playing Neil Simon's   Chapter 2. After a few seconds, George gets bored, and changes the station)  JERRY  Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little   longer) ELAINE  It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon. JERRY  (on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV   for another minute) The letter, that's the letter! ELAINE  What letter? JERRY  This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!   (Jerry get up to go find the letter. A second later, he returns, and starts   reading in unison with movie on TV.) JERRY  \"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness   still know that I love you!!\" GEORGE  This is incredible! JERRY  I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She cop-   ied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!  GEORGE  Maybe I won't send her that check.  ELAINE  You know, it's not really that terrible.  JERRY  What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself!   (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness!   James Caan doesn't offer happiness! Lippman's office. Lippman is on the phone when Elaine walks in and   places something on his desk. After she does, she tries to leave   but Lippman, still on the phone, motions for her to stay in the room)  LIPPMAN  (into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat)   But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's   unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take   care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West,   my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees   too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw   him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter.   She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some   friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore   cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right? ELAINE  Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.  LIPPMAN  Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?  ELAINE  Well, uh, fan. My father-- LIPPMAN  Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!  ELAINE  Really? LIPPMAN  Yeah. ELAINE  So... impudent. LIPPMAN  Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting   Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come. ELAINE  (pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--  LIPPMAN  Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.  ELAINE  (very reluctant) Okay. LIPPMAN  Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore   cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with   him. ELAINE  That will be fun. Nina's studio. Nina is working on a painting. Jerry is watching her,   sitting on the sofa.) JERRY  How's it coming? NINA  Good, good. JERRY  Seen any good movies lately? NINA  No... not really. You? JERRY  No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil   Simon? NINA  Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.  JERRY  I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh...   Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that? NINA  I don't know... maybe. JERRY  I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night.   Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help   notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens   answer the door...) MR. ARM  Well, we've made our decision. We want \"The Kramer.\"  Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and George are watching a baseball   game and talking.) GEORGE  Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)  JERRY  Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!  GEORGE  So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?  JERRY  Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can   you get this thing outta my house? GEORGE  Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right   now for ten bucks.  (the Yankees announcer is heard on TV) TVVOICE  Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the   Yankee dugout. GEORGE  Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.  TVVOICE  Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind   of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it   with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting   the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers?   Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field...\"  (Jerry and George look at each other, wondering.) the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are having   Kramer over for dinner.) KRAMER  ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a   steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.  MRS.ARM  More potatoes? KRAMER  Yeah, sure. Please. MR. ARM  Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?  KRAMER  Yeah.

If I want my ass hanging out of the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody goes, \"Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull that in there.\"  Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters. KRAMER  Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again. JERRY  What are you talking about? KRAMER  Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?  JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.  JERRY  Oh yeah, I know. KRAMER  Well, where is it? JERRY  What's the difference? KRAMER  Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.  JERRY  You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?  KRAMER  What happened to the car? JERRY  If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?  KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me. JERRY  You have to know, you must know. KRAMER  I must know. JERRY  Well, I'm not telling you. KRAMER  Oh, come on. JERRY  Nope. I don't think so. KRAMER  Well, please? JERRY  Not today, pal. KRAMER  Okay, I beg you. JERRY  Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it. KRAMER  Okay, please! Please tell me! JERRY  Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.  KRAMER  Okay, okay, what is it? Come on. JERRY  I loaned the car to George. KRAMER  Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?  JERRY  George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!  KRAMER  Alright. JERRY  Huh? KRAMER  Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?  JERRY  Will you stop it already?! KRAMER  You know, why didn't they ask me to go?  JERRY  I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!  KRAMER  What, they don't like me? JERRY  *I* don't like you! KRAMER  If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.   George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new hat.  GEORGE  I really think it looks good. ELAINE  Ten bucks, how can you go wrong? GEORGE  All bald people look good in hats.  ELAINE  You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then. GEORGE  What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.  ELAINE  Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?  GEORGE  No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face. ELAINE  Are you sure you like these sunglasses?   Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses and this causes George to swerve and hit something.  Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment. KRAMER  Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side. JERRY  Why not? KRAMER  Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?  JERRY  Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.   Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'. KRAMER  Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?  JERRY  No, I like Mike. KRAMER  Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation. JERRY  Oh yeah? What did you talk about? KRAMER  Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say. JERRY  Oh yeah? What did he say? KRAMER  You have to know everything, don't you?  JERRY  No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?  KRAMER  Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?  JERRY  Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.  KRAMER  Beg me. JERRY  Please, don't make me beg. KRAMER  No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just   want you to put some beg into it. Go on. JERRY  Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.  KRAMER  No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh... JERRY  Kramer! KRAMER  Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend. JERRY  Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.  KRAMER  Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.  JERRY  I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault! KRAMER  He thinks you're a phony. JERRY  He what? KRAMER  I told you, he thinks you're a phony.  JERRY  A phony? He called me a phony? KRAMER  A big phone. A big one. JERRY  Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!  KRAMER  You begged me.  Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a clanking noise. GEORGE  Do you hear that? ELAINE  Of course I hear that. GEORGE  You had to move the mirror? ELAINE  I wanted to check out my sunglasses.  GEORGE  I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium. ELAINE  Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.  GEORGE  I can't drive? ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this. ELAINE  No, I really don't. GEORGE  And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.  ELAINE  I'm sure you could. GEORGE  What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?  ELAINE  I don't know. GEORGE  Alright, start looking for spaces.  ELAINE  Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a   garage. GEORGE  Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front   of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.  ELAINE  Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space. GEORGE  I can't park in a garage. ELAINE  Why? GEORGE  I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it. ELAINE  I'll pay for it. GEORGE  You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces. ELAINE  Oh George, there's a space right there!  GEORGE  Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream   space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you? ELAINE  You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.   They share a laugh. GEORGE  Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key. ELAINE  Will you just park it already? GEORGE  There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!  ELAINE  George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking   space in this city. GEORGE  No no no, he's not getting away with this.  ELAINE  George?  George gets out of the car to confront the other driver. GEORGE  Hey, what are you doing? MIKE  I think I'm parking my car. GEORGE  You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.  MIKE  I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up. GEORGE  Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first? MIKE  Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I   pulled in. GEORGE  I was in the middle of a conversation.  MIKE  Hey, buddy, what can I tell you? GEORGE  The point is I was here first. MIKE  I was closer to this space than you were.  GEORGE  But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!  MIKE  I can if I have room! GEORGE  Are you gonna move the car? MIKE  No, I'm not gonna move the car. GEORGE  Jerk! MIKE  Oh, you're not? GEORGE  Do you believe this guy? ELAINE  Come on, we'll put it in a garage.  GEORGE  I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.  ELAINE  What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs. GEORGE  Are you coming back down? ELAINE  Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.  GEORGE  Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what   are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?  ELAINE  Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.  GEORGE  Oh, come on, you're good at this. ELAINE  What am I gonna say? GEORGE  I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.   Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.   Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.  ELAINE  Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?  JERRY  Yeah, under the counter. What happened?  ELAINE  Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter) JERRY  Tell me what happened.  Elaine (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver. JERRY  He is? ELAINE  Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.  JERRY  A gun?! ELAINE  I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.  JERRY  My god, are you okay? ELAINE  Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now   it's making a clanking noise. JERRY  Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.  ELAINE  Exactly. JERRY  Where's George now? ELAINE  Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space. JERRY  What are you talking about? ELAINE  Look out the window, you'll see. JERRY  Hey Georgie! GEORGE  Hey! JERRY  Are you okay? GEORGE  Yeah, I'm fine. JERRY  Crazy kids, huh? GEORGE  What? ELAINE  Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.  MIKE  Is that Jerry? Jerry?! JERRY  Oh, hey Mike.  George What, you know Jerry? MIKE  Yeah, I know Jerry. GEORGE  How do you know him? MIKE  What's the difference? GEORGE  Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.  MIKE  Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work! JERRY  I'm coming down. MIKE  Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?   George, What, you know Kramer?!  Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  Hi. KRAMER  Hello. JERRY  Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.  KRAMER  Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!  GEORGE  And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?  MIKE  Yeah. GEORGE  Oh great. ELAINE  You know that guy downstairs? JERRY  Yeah, he's a real phony. KRAMER  What's going on?! MIKE  Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!  GEORGE  It's my space! KRAMER  I'll be down in a minute. ELAINE  Are you going down? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Is anything wrong? KRAMER  Why should anything be wrong? ELAINE  Be down in a minute.  Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door. MIKE  Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to. GEORGE  I'll die out here.  Two bystanders are discussing the incident. BYSTANDER #1  He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space. BYSTANDER #2  No, it doesn't matter. He was- MIKE  Hey! Jerry! Long time no see! JERRY  Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.  MIKE  Hey Krame! You know this guy? KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, I know him. MIKE  You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen? JERRY  Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent. MIKE  Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer!   I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!  GEORGE  Oh, come on. MIKE  Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.  GEORGE  Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space? MIKE  Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.  GEORGE  You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park! MIKE  I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if   you pull out I'll show you! GEORGE  You've got a prayer. KRAMER  I go in front first all the time. JERRY  Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.   Elaine shows up and pulls George aside. GEORGE  Did you talk to him? ELAINE  Yeah, it's all taken care of. GEORGE  You told him? What did you tell him?  ELAINE  I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have   been there to appreciate it. GEORGE  I don't believe it, what did you say?  ELAINE  I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and   they followed us into the city. GEORGE  A pack of teenagers? ELAINE  Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car. GEORGE  You are a genius, it's as simple as that.  ELAINE  What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.  Elaine and George rejoin the others. KRAMER  By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.  ELAINE  What? KRAMER  Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.  GEORGE  Oh great. JERRY  I didn't know. ELAINE  Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.  GEORGE  Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.  MIKE  A flea market? You went to a flea market??  GEORGE  Hey, who's talking to you? ELAINE  We just didn't think of you. KRAMER  You said it, sister. GEORGE  What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?  People forget. Look at \"Home Alone\". They forgot. GEORGE  Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.  JERRY  I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!  GEORGE  Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.  JERRY  You're right. My fault. ELAINE  Kramer? I'm so sorry, really. GEORGE  Yeah, I'm sorry. KRAMER  I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.  GEORGE  What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry? JERRY  It was a so-so sorry.  A delivery truck pulls up and honks. The driver leans out of the cab.  TRUCK DRIVER  Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!  GEORGE  You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.  MIKE  And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?  TRUCK DRIVER  Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!  Fade out/in. ELAINE  You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them. JERRY  Wild pack of teenagers, huh? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.  ELAINE  Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?  GEORGE  Uh huh. JERRY  Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,  GEORGE  Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of. ELAINE  Right. GEORGE  I learned a lot about myself. JERRY  What did you do to my car?! GEORGE  I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.  ELAINE  Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.  JERRY  I thought you said you were a good driver!  GEORGE  No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.  JERRY  I think you said driver. GEORGE  Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.  MIKE  Will you move it up a little bit? GEORGE  No no no, that's in the right position.  MIKE  No no, I was further in. GEORGE  No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.  MIKE  Do you mind? GEORGE  Do you? SID  Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.  JERRY  Hey Sid. MIKE  Who are you? SID  Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed? GEORGE  Sid, it's completely his fault. MIKE  Oh, right. SID  Why don't you start taking the bus?  JERRY  Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes. GEORGE  Don't do it! JERRY  What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?  GEORGE  Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.  ELAINE  Why don't you just flip a coin already?  GEORGE  No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking. ELAINE  You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.  GEORGE  So you're against me now?  An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen yogurt store, are discussing the incident. ANGRY MAN  He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first. MATTHEW  No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.  ANGRY MAN  No he wasn't. MATTHEW  All that matters is who was there first.  ANGRY MAN  Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.  MATTHEW  You just spit on me! ANGRY MAN  Don't you raise your voice to me! MATTHEW  You're not my father. JERRY  Hey Matthew. MATTHEW  Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.  JERRY  How ya doing? MATTHEW  Okay. JERRY  Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.  MATTHEW  What?! JERRY  Oh no, nothing. MATTHEW  What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?  JERRY  No, no, no, no. MATTHEW  We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?  JERRY  No, of course not, of course not! MATTHEW  Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money? MARYEDITH  Jerry?! What's the matter with you?  JERRY  I didn't-- MARYEDITH  Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes. KRAMER  Oh, congratulations. MARYEDITH  What for? KRAMER  Well, you're pregnant. MARYEDITH  What? KRAMER  You're not pregnant? MARYEDITH  No, I'm not pregnant. KRAMER  Are you sure you're not pregnant? MARYEDITH  Yes, I'm sure! KRAMER  That's weird. MARYEDITH  Come on, Matthew. MATTHEW  No. MARYEDITH  Come on, Matthew! KRAMER  I thought she was pregnant. JERRY  Hey, do you think I'm phony? ELAINE  What? JERRY  Mike thinks I'm a phony. ELAINE  He thinks you're a phony? JERRY  Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me. ELAINE  Oh, you have to say something. JERRY  I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.  ELAINE  You gotta open the vault. JERRY  Open my vault? ELAINE  Open your vault. JERRY  Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.  ELAINE  You have no choice. JERRY  Oy ga-vault. NEWMAN  You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.  George begins applauding. KRAMER  When can you park head first? NEWMAN  Never. MIKE  What are you asking this guy for? NEWMAN  Who's talking to you? GEORGE  He's right. never. MIKE  Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car? NEWMAN  Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.  GEORGE  When do you ever have ten car lengths?  KRAMER  What about Sundays and holidays? GEORGE  Oh please.  A passerby (Sheila) stops and asks George, SHEILA  What's going on here? GEORGE  Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.  SHEILA  I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it. GEORGE  Well, thank you for your support. SHEILA  Hey, that's a great hat. GEORGE  Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.  NEWMAN  Hey George, nice hat. GEORGE  Yeah, thanks. NEWMAN  Can I try it on? GEORGE  No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you. NEWMAN  Well sure it would. GEORGE  No! Get out of here, Newman. NEWMAN  Come on, let me try it on. GEORGE  No, Newman, stop it. SHEILA  Let him try it on. GEORGE  I don't want him to! SHEILA  What is wrong with you? GEORGE  You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat! NEWMAN  Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.  GEORGE  Alright, just keep the hat! JERRY  Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine? ELAINE  It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?  KRAMER  I'm not going if he's going. NEWMAN  Me either. GEORGE  I'm not going if he's going. MIKE  Well I'm going. JERRY  Well if he's going then I'm not going.  NEWMAN  But it's your house. JERRY  I still don't have to go. ELAINE  Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.  MIKE  Why won't you go if I go? JERRY  Why? I'll tell you why. KRAMER  No. Don't, Jerry. JERRY  Like you didn't call me a phony? MIKE  What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang. JERRY  Use it in a sentence. MIKE  Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?  KRAMER  He begged me. MIKE  He begged you?! JERRY  Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?   Two police officers walk up. COP #1  Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 'em. Let's go.  GEORGE  Officer, could I just explain something to you?  COP #1  Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes. GEORGE  Officer, he can't pull in head first.  MIKE  Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was   sitting there. COP #1  Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head first. COP #2  Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy was just sitting over there. COP #1  What are you talking about? This guy was here first.  COP #2  But he didn't take it. COP #1  Hey, it's his space. COP #2  No, it's his space.  Cut to Jerry entering his apartment, George and Mike can be heard arguing through the window. GEORGE  Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!  MIKE  Well, you're gonna have to go to work!  GEORGE  I don't have a job! MIKE  Neither do I!  Jerry closes the window, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote and turns on the TV. REFEREE  Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*   Jerry falls over and hides his face in the couch cushion.  (Comedy club)  People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because they think, 'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 'I'll be circling for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons.' I think because everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. It's like Musical Chairs except everybody sat down around 1964. The problem is car manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars every year, they're not making any new spaces. That's what they should be working on. Wouldn't that be great? You go to the Auto Show, they got that big revolving turntable, and there's nothing on it. New from Chrysler, a space.     THE END>",

        "text": "   THE KEYS Written by  Larry Charles   (Comedy club)  So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) \"Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again.\" They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system...\"Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment.\" You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet \"hide-a-key\" under the wing...\"maybe he left it up there somewhere...\"  OPENING SCENE  Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.  JERRY'S BRAIN  What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.   (Jerry notices his door is open.) JERRY'S BRAIN  What the hell...? Why is the door open?   (Jerry looks out into the hallway, turns back into his apartment, and runs into Kramer in the dark. They both scream. Kramer turns on the light.)  JERRY  Kramer, what are you doing here!? KRAMER  Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,\" and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.  JERRY  You scared me! KRAMER  It's just me. JERRY  That's enough! KRAMER  Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)   New scene. Jerry's apartment, daytime. We hear Jerry hurriedly trying to get in the door.  JERRY  C'mon...c'mon...  (Jerry enters, sheds his jacket, drops his luggage and heads for the bathroom. He opens the door to find Kramer taking a bubble bath in his tub.)  JERRY  Kramer! What are you doing?! KRAMER  What does it look like I'm doing? What?  JERRY  Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!  KRAMER  Alright, alright... JERRY  C'mon! KRAMER  Sorry. JERRY  Move it! Move it! Get going! KRAMER  My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)  JERRY  Is that my towel?  (Kramer loses the towel in the hallway and throws it on Jerry's floor from the other side of the door.)   New scene. Jerry's hallway at night. Jerry approaches his door with a girlfriend.  GIRLFRIEND  I'm really happy the movie was sold out.  JERRY  Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?  GIRLFRIEND  I'm from Witchita, so... JERRY  Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)  GIRLFRIEND  Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry! JERRY  The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)  GIRLFRIEND  That was close! JERRY  Did you see the look on that guy's face?  GIRLFRIEND  You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)  JERRY  Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!  KRAMER  Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.  JERRY  All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.  KRAMER  What? JERRY  What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.  KRAMER  Oh, come on! JERRY  No, come on! KRAMER  What, what, I thought you went to the movies!  JERRY  It was sold out! KRAMER  Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?  JERRY  That's the point. KRAMER  What point? JERRY  Just, look, just give the keys. KRAMER  Just give me another chance! JERRY  Don't ask me! KRAMER  I'm asking you! JERRY  I'm telling you. KRAMER  You're joking. JERRY  I'm serious! KRAMER  It's not going to happen again! JERRY  Yes it will, now give me those keys!   (Jerry and Kramer begin struggling over the keys. Kramer loses his footing and falls on the floor, taking his girlfriend down with him.)  KRAMER  O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)   New scene. Jerry's apartment, the next day. Jerry is now giving his spare keys to Elaine.  JERRY  So put 'em in a safe place. ELAINE  I will. JERRY  Where? ELAINE  I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?  JERRY  I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.  ELAINE  Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.  JERRY  I can't.  (There's a gentle knock at the door.) ELAINE  Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.) JERRY  Who's there? KRAMER  Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...  ELAINE  Oh, I'm not, uh... KRAMER  No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke \"the covenant of the keys.\"  ELAINE  Jerry, give him the keys back. JERRY  Elaine...  (Elaine tries to give the keys to Kramer, but Jerry won't let her. Jerry and Elaine begin struggling over the keys. Kramer breaks it up.)  KRAMER  I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.  JERRY  Take the keys. KRAMER  I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)  JERRY  O.K.! KRAMER  Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.  JERRY  Your spare set? KRAMER  That's right. JERRY  You want 'em back? KRAMER  Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.   (Jerry takes a huge ring with hundreds of keys on it out of his drawer, and hands it to Kramer. Kramer begins going through them.)   New scene at the coffee shop. Kramer is now giving the huge keyring to George.  GEORGE  Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.  KRAMER  Say yes! Yes, George. Yes! GEORGE  Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.  KRAMER  Well, you can get 'em back. GEORGE  I suppose I could. KRAMER  Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.  GEORGE  Me? KRAMER  Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.  GEORGE  Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)  WAITRESS  Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)  KRAMER  Do you ever yearn? GEORGE  Yearn? Do I yearn? KRAMER  I yearn. GEORGE  You yearn. KRAMER  Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?  GEORGE  Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.  KRAMER  Look at you. GEORGE  Aw, Kramer, don't start... KRAMER  You're wasting your life. GEORGE  I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!  KRAMER  O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?  GEORGE  No. KRAMER  You got money? GEORGE  No. KRAMER  Do you have a woman? GEORGE  No. KRAMER  Do you have any prospects? GEORGE  No. KRAMER  You got anything on the horizon? GEORGE  Uh...no. KRAMER  Do you have any action at all? GEORGE  No. KRAMER  Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?  GEORGE  I like to get the Daily News! KRAMER  George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.  GEORGE  Why? KRAMER  I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.  GEORGE  Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.  KRAMER  No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.  GEORGE  \"These pretzels are making me thirsty\"? That was one line! You got fired!  KRAMER  I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?  GEORGE  Uh, no, I'm not. KRAMER  Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)  GEORGE  You're not really gonna go to California, are you?  KRAMER  Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)   New scene, Elaine's apartment at night. George is picking up his spare keys from Elaine.  GEORGE  Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.  ELAINE  Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?  GEORGE  I don't know. He said he wants to be my \"key brother.\"  ELAINE  That's ridiculous. GEORGE  That's Kramer. ELAINE  I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.  GEORGE  What for? ELAINE  'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry. GEORGE  Jerry? Why? ELAINE  'Cause he gave me his. GEORGE  So what? ELAINE  So, if he has my keys, I should have his.  GEORGE  Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.  ELAINE  I just said the same thing to you.  GEORGE  What? ELAINE  What? GEORGE  Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?  ELAINE  Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.   New scene, Jerry's apartment the next day. JERRY  Did you bring the keys? GEORGE  Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.  JERRY  This could be an emergency! GEORGE  You never should have taken away his keys!  JERRY  I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)  GEORGE  How'd the Mets do? JERRY  They lost.  (Jerry and George open Kramer's door and poke their heads in.)  JERRY  Kramer?  (Newman walks up behind them.) NEWMAN  Hello, boys. JERRY  Hello, Newman. NEWMAN  You lookin' for someone? JERRY  Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!  NEWMAN  Coy? I'm not being coy. JERRY  Is he being coy? GEORGE  Yeah, coy. JERRY  You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?  NEWMAN  Who? JERRY  Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!  NEWMAN  Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.  JERRY  Turn around, George. GEORGE  Sure. (Turns around.) NEWMAN  George? JERRY  Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)  NEWMAN  Help! Help! JERRY  Where's Kramer? NEWMAN  HELP! (Elaine enters.) ELAINE  What's going on?  (Newman grabs Elaine and hides behind her.) NEWMAN  They're gonna beat me up! GEORGE  No we're not. JERRY  We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.  NEWMAN  You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.  JERRY  Bad rap? NEWMAN  Yeah. From you. JERRY  Me? NEWMAN  You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.  JERRY  L.A.?  (Cut to Kramer in his car on the highway, listening to rock music. The car's engine starts to fail, then stalls. Kramer can't believe it.)   Commercial break.  New scene, Jerry's apartment at night (Jerry's at the window, George and Elaine are on the couch).  JERRY  I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?  ELAINE  Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullsh*t.  JERRY  Huh? ELAINE  What...? JERRY  No, what'd you say? ELAINE  Nothing. I didn't say anything. JERRY  Oh, you didn't see it. ELAINE  Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.  JERRY  I heard you say something, there. ELAINE  I didn't say anything. JERRY  I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!  GEORGE  Ask her about Kramer. JERRY  She's drunk out of her mind.  (Cut back to Kramer with his car broken down on the side of the highway. He tries to thumb a ride.)   New scene, Jerry approaching his apartment door. He tries to unlock it, but realizes Elaine has his keys. Jerry goes to the coffee shop to call Elaine.  JERRY  Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.   New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch a ride on the back of a motorcycle.  KRAMER  Hey! You ever been in an accident?  BIKER  About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)   New scene. Jerry in a booth at the coffee shop waiting for George. George enters, spare keys in hand.  JERRY  Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.  GEORGE  Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.  JERRY  Don't feel right? What are you talking about?  GEORGE  Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?  JERRY  What is the big deal? GEORGE  Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.  JERRY  First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.  GEORGE  Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.  JERRY  Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)  GEORGE  Nope, no can do. JERRY  George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!  GEORGE  Do you wanna fight? JERRY  Do you wanna fight? GEORGE  I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)   New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch another ride, this time with a van full of drugged-out hippies. Kramer is telling them a story as they go down the road...  KRAMER  And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.  HIPPIE #1  Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.  KRAMER  Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.  HIPPIE #1  Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?  KRAMER  Oh, he's cold. HIPPIE #1  Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!  KRAMER  Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!  HIPPIE #1  Hey, what's the rush, man? KRAMER  Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.  HIPPIE #1  Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?  KRAMER  What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)  HIPPIE #2  Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)   New scene, Elaine's building at night. Jerry and George approach Elaine's door, still arguing about the keys.  JERRY  Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.  GEORGE  You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t.  JERRY  What's that? GEORGE  Nothing. JERRY  I heard something. GEORGE  Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)   New scene. Kramer's managed to hitch yet another ride, this time with a woman driving an eighteen-wheeler.  KRAMER  So, how long you been drivin' this thing?  WOMAN  Goin' on four years. KRAMER  Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.  WOMAN  Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.  KRAMER  You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.  WOMAN  You want to give it a try? KRAMER  Really? WOMAN  Do you know how to double-clutch? KRAMER  Yeah. WOMAN  Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)   New scene, Jerry and George in Elaine's apartment looking for Jerry's spare keys.  GEORGE  They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!  JERRY  Well, this is great. GEORGE  Well, what do they look like? JERRY  They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) \"What do they look like.\"  GEORGE  Well, they're obviously not here. JERRY  Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.  GEORGE  Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!  JERRY  What is this? \"Murphy Brown\"? GEORGE  What? JERRY  By Elaine Benes? GEORGE  What? JERRY  Elaine's writing a \"Murphy Brown\"?  GEORGE  Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)  JERRY  Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)  GEORGE  Gimme half! JERRY  All right, here! GEORGE  Why didn't she tell us? JERRY  Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)  ELAINE  You weasels! JERRY  What? What? ELAINE  How dare you! GEORGE  We hardly read anything! JERRY  It was funny! ELAINE  Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?  JERRY  Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...  ELAINE  Well, it's just a first draft! JERRY  I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.  ELAINE  Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)  GEORGE  He forced me to! JERRY  I did not! GEORGE  Yes you did! ELAINE  You! Get out! Get out! Get out! JERRY  Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!  ELAINE  Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!  JERRY  Good! ELAINE  And I want my keys back from you! GEORGE  What, you don't want me to hold your keys?  ELAINE  No, you can't be trusted! GEORGE  Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)  JERRY  And I don't want you to hold mine!  ELAINE  Good! I won't! JERRY  Good! Don't! Are these my keys? ELAINE  These aren't my keys! GEORGE  Whose are these? ELAINE  I don't know!  (Meanwhile, Kramer's finally made it to Los Angeles. He's shown roller-skating through traffic, and nearly running over some guy on a scooter.)   Commercial break.  New scene, Jerry and Elaine watching \"Murphy Brown\" in Jerry's apartment.  ELAINE  I just thought I could write it. JERRY  Is that something you want to do? ELAINE  I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.  JERRY  Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a \"Murphy Brown.\" You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.  ELAINE  O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.  JERRY  What did you say? ELAINE  I didn't say anything. JERRY  I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on \"Murphy Brown\"!  ELAINE  Kramer's on \"Murphy Brown\"! JERRY  Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!   (Cut to the screen of Jerry's TV.) CANDICE BERGEN  Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary.  KRAMER  Oh, good morning, Miss Brown. CANDICE BERGEN  And you are...? KRAMER  Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell. CANDICE BERGEN  Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell. KRAMER  Steven. CANDICE BERGEN  Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?  KRAMER  Oh - I'm familiar with it. CANDICE BERGEN  Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you.  THE END>",

GEORGE  Murphy Brown, the TV show. JERRY  C'mon, will ya? GEORGE  Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!  JERRY  Something, isn't it? GEORGE  With Candace Bergen! JERRY  I know! GEORGE  I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?  JERRY  Sure. GEORGE  Did she show her breasts in that? JERRY  She's not really the naked type. GEORGE  I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California. JERRY  He did? GEORGE  Yeah, I turned him down. JERRY  How come you didn't tell me? GEORGE  He asked me to keep it a secret. JERRY  But you can never keep a secret. GEORGE  I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds. JERRY  Well, you've come a long way. GEORGE  I've matured. JERRY  Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do   the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go? GEORGE  A free ticket? JERRY  Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys. GEORGE  What about accommodations? JERRY  All taken care of. GEORGE  Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...  Kramer, backstage, talking to some aspiring young actors. KRAMER  So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions. STUDIO GUARD  Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?  KRAMER  Uh, did you? STUDIO GUARD  C'mon, let's go. KRAMER  Well, I was just-- STUDIO GUARD  Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. C'mon, let's go.  KRAMER  Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?   Kramer's apartment building in LA. Singers and actors are heard practicing in the background. Kramer leaves his apartment and makes a call on the pay phone in the hall. VOICE  Murphy Brown. KRAMER  Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.  VOICE  Who's calling please? KRAMER  Well, just tell her that it's Kramer.   Dial tone. KRAMER  Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.  Helena, a neighbor, steps into the hallway. HELENA  Hello Kramer. KRAMER  Oh, uh, Helena, how are you? HELENA  I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?  KRAMER  Well, that's only uh, 58 years. HELENA  It was a Three Stooges short, \"Sappy Pappy.\" I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember? KRAMER  Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?  HELENA  No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it. KRAMER  Uh huh, right. HELENA  But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake. KRAMER  Right. HELENA  Moe hits Curly with an axe, KRAMER  Uh huh. HELENA  The Stooges catch the kidnappers, KRAMER  Right. HELENA  But it's too late. KRAMER  Really. HELENA  The baby's dead. KRAMER  Really? HELENA  The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.  KRAMER  Well I don't remember that part. HELENA  I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary. KRAMER  Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.  HELENA  Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all. KRAMER  Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.  HELENA  Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?  KRAMER  Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright? HELENE  Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,  KRAMER  Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.  HELENA  I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer!  Jerry's apartment. George walks in with several stuffed suitcases and backpacks. JERRY  What is this? GEORGE  What? JERRY  We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?  GEORGE  I happen to dress based on mood. JERRY  Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.  GEORGE  Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza. JERRY  (referring to George's outfit): And what mood is this.  GEORGE  This is Morning Mist.  A murder scene. There's a body under a blanket and two Lieutenants are talking.  LT. COLEMAN  What do you figure, 20? 21? LT. MARTEL  Close enough. LT. COLEMAN  Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.  LT. MARTEL  No ID? LT. COLEMAN  No ID. LT. MARTEL  No witnesses? LT. COLEMAN  Just the trees, Johnny. Pretty young thing.  LT. MARTEL  She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.  LT. COLEMAN  Sure did, Johnny. Damn shame too. What do you make of it?  LT. MARTEL  I don't know, but I don't like it.   Jerry and George are at the airport, in line for the metal detector.  JERRY  Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him. GEORGE  Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension. JERRY  Just go.  George braces himself and walks through the detector. GEORGE  Heh he, I made it.  Jerry walks through and the machine beeps. SECURITY GUARD  Empty your pockets please.  Jerry empties his pockets and walks through again, the machine beeps again.  SECURITY GUARD  Walk through again please.  Jerry walks through, the machine beeps again. SECURITY GUARD  Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets? JERRY  Anklets? SECURITY GUARD  A lot of men wear anklets. JERRY  Really? SECURITY GUARD  Yeah. OTHER SECURITY GUARD  What do you have in your bag, sir?  GEORGE  My bag? SECURITY GUARD  Step over here please. JERRY  Over here? OTHER SECURITY GUARD  Do you have a knife in the bag? GEORGE  A knife? OTHER SECURITY GUARD  Open the bag, please.  George opens his bag, the other security guard begins rummaging.  OTHER SECURITY GUARD  What's this? GEORGE  Moisturizer? OTHER SECURITY GUARD  Your wife? GEORGE  No, I uh... I use it. SECURITY GUARD  Spread your arms and legs please.  The security guard begins waving a small beeping detector up and down Jerry's body. JERRY  Ladies and gentlemen, I implore  you. OTHER SECURITY GUARD  Have a good trip. SECURITY GUARD  Alright, go ahead. JERRY  That's it? SECURITY GUARD  That's it. JERRY  Alright. GEORGE  C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?  JERRY  I must have iron rich blood. GEORGE  Here we go, LA. JERRY  The Coast, GEORGE  La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?  JERRY  Who said that? GEORGE  I called it. JERRY  Oh no.  Monologue, Jerry on stage.  Seems to me that the closest thing we have to Royalty in America are the people that get to ride in those little carts through the airport. Don't you hate these things? They come out of nowhere; Beep Beep, cart people, look out, cart people! Look out! We all scurry out of the way like worthless peasants. Oooh! It's cart people! I hope we didn't slow you down. Wave to the cart people, Timmy, they're the best people in the world. Ya know, if you're too fat, slow and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready for air travel. The other people I hate are the people that get on to the moving walkway and then just stand there. Like it's a ride? Excuse me, there's no animated pirates or bears along the way here. Do your legs work at all?   Stock photo of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Cut to a casting office. Kramer enters.  KRAMER  Yeah, I'm here for the audition. RECEPTIONIST  Which audition, the music video, the horror movie, the exercise tape or the infomercial? KRAMER  Uh, let's see... well.  Cut to a montage of Kramer in group auditions for the productions the receptionist mentioned.  Kramer and Chelsea, a woman he met in the horror movie audition, exit the casting office. KRAMER  You scream good. CHELSEA  You too.  Kramer and Chelsea are seated at a restaurant table. CHELSEA  So, can I keep this treatment? KRAMER  Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies. CHELSEA  'Cause I can, uh, show it to my manager. He has connections with West German television money. KRAMER  Really. CHELSEA  Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun.   I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend. KRAMER  Um-hm. CHELSEA  What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on... KRAMER  Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage. CHELSEA  Big deal. KRAMER  He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment. CHELSEA  Why are you breathing so hard? KRAMER  Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?  Kramer gets up and approaches Fred Savage who's sitting at a table nearby.  KRAMER  Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...  FRED SAVAGE  Thank you. KRAMER  Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.  FRED  Thanks. KRAMER  Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...  FRED  That's ok. Relax, relax. KRAMER  Ok, but I got this...  Kramer lifts his leg and places his foot on a low table and the table collapses.  KRAMER  Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me. FRED  Yeah, its fate,  you know, can't avoid your fate. KRAMER  I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.  FRED  Yeah. KRAMER  So I'd like to give it to you. FRED  Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!  KRAMER  Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.   Fred takes the treatment and bolts for the door. After he leaves, Kramer gives the rest of the patrons a thumbs-up.  George and Jerry are in their hotel room. Jerry's on the telephone.  JERRY  Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair? GEORGE  Curly. JERRY  Wavy. GEORGE  What'd you ask me for? JERRY  Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on   the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin? GEORGE  Nope. JERRY  'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just   the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello? GEORGE  Hey, a shoe buffing machine! JERRY  I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?  GEORGE  You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body lotion! JERRY  About 6-3. GEORGE  Ooh, a shower cap!  KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK JERRY  Coming.  George walks to the door wearing a shower cap. LUPE  Hello. I have more towels. GEORGE  Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?  LUPE  Lupe. GEORGE  Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning? LUPE  Yes. GEORGE  Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in. LUPE  Oh, yes, yes. GEORGE  Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets. LUPE  Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.  GEORGE  Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?  LUPE  It's too tight. (Gesturing towards Jerry) Him too?  GEORGE  Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?  JERRY  Excuse me, what? GEORGE  You want your blankets tucked in? JERRY  What blankets? GEORGE  When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.  JERRY  I don't know, whatever they do. LUPE  I tuck in? Yes? JERRY  Tuck in, tuck in. GEORGE  Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.  LUPE  Okay. GEORGE  Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck. JERRY  Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.  GEORGE  Two no-tucks. JERRY  Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.  GEORGE  You just said you weren't tucking.  JERRY  I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway. GEORGE  Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?  JERRY  Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin? LUPE  Oh, yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room.  JERRY  Oh, okay, thanks. LUPE  Thank you. GEORGE  Thank you. LUPE  Bye-bye. GEORGE  Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now. LUPE  Bye. GEORGE  Bye-bye.  Lupe exits. JERRY  I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a   whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it. GEORGE  Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.  JERRY  They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!  GEORGE  Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.  JERRY  Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.  GEORGE  Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?   Cut to Jerry and George in the car, continuing their discussion.  GEORGE  You shouldn't have tucked. JERRY  I like it tucked. GEORGE  Nobody tucks anymore.  As Jerry drives past, Kramer exits a printing shop, gets into his car and drives off, spilling dozens of 8\"x10\" publicity photos. A police office notices this and picks up one of the photos.  Another murder scene. A police officer pulls a blanket over the body's head, but we catch a glimpse of the dead girl; it's Chelsea, Kramer's friend from the auditions. The same two Lieutenants as before are just arriving.  OFFICER  Hey, Lieutenant. LT. MARTEL  Yeah. OFFICER  This was found on her person. LT. MARTEL  On her person? What kind of expression is that?  OFFICER  I don't know, sir. Police lingo. LT. MARTEL  Oh yeah? What's your name, son. OFFICER  Ross. LT. MARTEL  Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?  OFFICER  Yes sir. LT. MARTEL  She's dead. Have you got that? OFFICER  Yes sir. LT. MARTEL  Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.  OFFICER  Yes sir.  The Lt. examines the evidence. It's a title page that says \"The Keys\" A movie treatment by Kramer. The paper is torn so that the space where Kramer's first name was is missing. LT. MARTEL  I think we just caught a break.  Jerry and George are at the NBC studio. GEORGE  This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on   the show? JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  Might meet a celebrity. JERRY  I can't believe she threw out my napkin.  GEORGE  What are you worried about, you know it.  JERRY  You gonna be alright here? GEORGE  Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around. JERRY  Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes. GEORGE  Go, go, go, don't worry about it.  Jerry leaves and Corbin Bernsen enters through a stage door. he stands near George, obviously waiting for someone. GEORGE  Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.  CORBIN BERNSEN  How ya doing? GEORGE  Big fan! Big fan. CORBIN BERNSEN  Yeah. GEORGE  Hey, you grew a beard, huh? CORBIN BERNSEN  Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus.  GEORGE  Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.  CORBIN BERNSEN  Really.  Flash forward to the middle of George's 'pitch'. GEORGE  ...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days. CORBIN BERNSEN  Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened? GEORGE  Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.  CORBIN BERNSEN  So you killed the cat. GEORGE  That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?  Corbin Bernsen just stares at George.  Flash forward, George is now talking with George Wendt in the same hallway.  GEORGE  I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.  GEORGE WENDT  Oh, of course not. GEORGE  But really, it's enough with the bar already.  GEORGE WENDT  Yeah, well. GEORGE  Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?  GEORGE WENDT  Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah. GEORGE  Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?  GEORGE WENDT  Well yeah, they do, heh heh. GEORGE  What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.  GEORGE WENDT  Yeah, you oughta  write one of those. GEORGE  Yeah? GEORGE WENDT  Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh...  GEORGE  Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!   Jerry walks up as George Wendt leaves hastily. JERRY  How's it going? GEORGE  Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt. JERRY  Really? GEORGE  Yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate! JERRY  You got toilet paper on your heel there.   George looks down, Jerry walks away.  The Tonight Show, George is in the audience applauding. ANNOUNCER  It's the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.  Quick cut to Corbin Bernsen, mid-interview. CORBIN BERNSEN  Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.  Quick shot of the audience, everyone is laughing besides George.   Cut to a police station. Helena is being questioned by Lt. Martel.  HELENA  He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.  Cut back to the Tonight Show, George Wendt, mid-interview. GEORGE WENDT  It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar.  Another quick shot of the audience, again everyone is laughing besides George.   Cut back to the police station. One of the kids from the van Kramer hitched a ride to LA in (see \"The Keys\") known only as 'The Freak' is being questioned by the Lt. THE FREAK  So that's when I said, \"Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?\" And he said, \"What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid?  Cut back to the Tonight Show, Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt are talking between takes. GEORGE WENDT  The guy you talked to, what did he look like?  CORBIN BERNSEN  Short little bald guy with glasses.  GEORGE WENDT  Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked to.  CORBIN BERNSEN  It never ends, does it?  Cut to Jerry, on stage, doing his routine. JERRY  So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little   uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.  Quick shot of the audience, nobody is laughing.  Quick shot of an extremely uncomfortable Jerry.  Cut back to the police station. The Lt. is on the phone. LT. MARTEL  Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh, Kramer.  George and Jerry are leaving the Tonight Show set, JERRY  I was terrible. GEORGE  What are you, crazy? You were fine.  JERRY  Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh... GEORGE  Conveyor belt. JERRY  Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.  GEORGE  I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?  JERRY  Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.  George and Jerry walk past a TV and stop as a special report is being broadcast.  TV NEWSCASTER  Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called 'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as \"Kramer\".   George and Jerry stare at each other in disbelief.  TO BE CONTINUED.  (Comedy club)  Talk show hosts never seem to have any idea how much time is left in the show. You know, they're always looking off camera, \"Do we have time? Are we out of time? How we doin' on time? Anybody know what the time is? What's the time? Check the time?\" You never see Magnum P.I. go, \"Should I strangle this guy or are we gonna take a break here? Can you stay for another beating? I'll tell you what, I'll bop him in the head, we'll do a commercial, we'll come back, I'll drive in the car real fast, stay with us.\"     THE END>",

        "text": "   THE TRIP PART 2 Written by   Larry Charles   (Comedy club)  There are many different job in the police. It seems to me, that the chalk outline guy is one of the better jobs that you can get. You know it's not dangerous, the criminals are long gone, that seems like a good one. I don't know who they are, I guess they're people who wanted to be a sketch artists, but they couldn't draw too well...\"listen Johnson, forget the sketches. Do you think if we left a dead body right there on the sidewalk, you could manage to trace around it? Could you do that?\". I don't even know how it helps to solve the crime? You know, they look at the thing on the ground...\"aah his arm was like that when he hit the pavement. That means the killer must've been Jim.\"   OPENING SCENE  GEORGE AND JERRY ARE IN A CAR. GEORGE IS GRABBING JERRY'S ARM  GEORGE  He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!  JERRY  Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!  GEORGE  What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?  JERRY  Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.  GEORGE  Hope he's not the guy. JERRY  Couldn't be the guy...nah. GEORGE  God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.  JERRY  How can you think of food at the time like this?  GEORGE  Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.  JERRY  I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!  GEORGE  I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.  JERRY  You should've had some eggs. GEORGE  For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?  JERRY  Have you ever heard of egg salad? GEORGE  Why didn't you say something then?  JERRY  I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?  GEORGE  I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.  JERRY  I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.  GEORGE  Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.   CUT TO KRAMER SINGING IN A SHOWER FOLLOWED BY A FALLING SOUND   BACK TO GEORGE AND JERRY ON THE STREET JERRY  I don't have any change. You've got any change?  GEORGE  No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.  JERRY  Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.  GEORGE  I have a ten. JERRY  So, break it. GEORGE  I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.  JERRY  So, buy something. GEORGE  What? JERRY  I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.  GEORGE  Breath problem? JERRY  No, I just want some change. GEORGE  Tell me. JERRY  Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.  GEORGE  You know, I haven't eaten anything.  JERRY  I just wanna call the police! GEORGE  Why don't you just call 911? JERRY  But is this an emergency? GEORGE  Of course it is. JERRY  How is this an emergency? GEORGE  Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.  JERRY  All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...  GEORGE  What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!  JERRY  Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?  GEORGE  What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?  JERRY  Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.  GEORGE  Really? JERRY  Sure. GEORGE  You think so? JERRY  Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?  GEORGE  I don't know. JERRY  We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.  GEORGE  Excuse me, where are we? MAN  Earth. JERRY  Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.  GEORGE  Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?  WOMAN  I don't know. GEORGE  You don't know? WOMAN  I don't know. GEORGE  How come you don't know what street are you on?  WOMAN  You don't know. JERRY  George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.   (Police car rolls by the sidewalk and stops. The police listens their conversation.)  GEORGE  Black and white? JERRY  A cop car. GEORGE  Why didn't you just say that? JERRY  I thought it sounded kind of cool.  GEORGE  Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.  JERRY  Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.  GEORGE  I'll bet you, how much? JERRY  Her tip. GEORGE  You've got a bet. JERRY  Ok. GEORGE  How much do you tip a chamber maid?  POLICE  Which one of you is Costanza?  (Jerry and George point at each other.) POLICE  Get in. GEORGE  Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...   KRAMER IS SHAVING. HE SNEEZES AND GETS SHAVING CREAM ON THE MIRROR   BACK TO THE POLICE CAR WITH JERRY, GEORGE AND TWO COPS GEORGE  Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.   JERRY SEARCHES FOR THE HANDLE, BUT CAN'T FIND ONE JERRY  Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.  COP  Cut it up back there. GEORGE  He started it. JERRY  I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?  COP  I don't think so. JERRY  But you could? COP  Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.  COP 2  We could drive on the wrong side of the road.  COP  Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.  COP 2  Shoot people... GEORGE  You guys ever shot anybody? COPS  No... GEORGE  Hey, can I flip on the siren? JERRY  Why are you bothering them for? GEORGE  I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.  COP  Yeah, go ahead.  GEORGE TRIES THE SIREN. GEORGE  Wohoo, check it out. JERRY  Can I try it? COP  Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.  JERRY TRIES THE SIREN JERRY  Scared the hell out of that guy. GEORGE  You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always \"waaaa, waaaa\", you know now it \"woo-woo-woo-woo-woo\". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?  JERRY  Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...  JERRY AND GEORGE  Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa... COP  Hey!  KRAMER IS COMBING HIS HAIR. TRYING TO GET THE COMB THROUGH.  KRAMER  I'm dizzy.  BACK TO THE POLICE CAR JERRY  Nice shotgun. COP  Thanks. JERRY  Clean as a whistle.

GEORGE GET CLOSER TO JERRY AND THEY THROW THE GUY NEXT TO GEORGE  MONOLOGUE  I can't believe that cops still have to read that whole \"you have the right to remain silence\"-speech to every criminal they arrest. I mean is there anybody who doesn't know that by now? Can't they just go \"Freeze, you're under arrest. You've ever seen Baretta? Yeah, good, get in the car.\"   BACK TO POLICE CAR GEORGE  Hi.

OFFICER DRAGS KRAMER AWAY  KRAMER IS BEEN INTERROGATED BY LT. MARTEL KRAMER  I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!  LT. MARTEL  Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that?  KRAMER  You're making a big mistake. LT. MARTEL  No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay.  KRAMER  What? LT. MARTEL  Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again.  KRAMER  Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!  LT. MARTEL  Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out.  KRAMER  Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...  LT. MARTEL  I'm not interested in your explanations, Kramer! Sure, I bet you've got a million of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough, maybe the teacher didn't call on you in school when you had your little hand raised, maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh? Well, I've got another theory Kramer: you're a weed.  KRAMER  No... LT. MARTEL  Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the all pretty flowers.   KRAMER SOBS LT. MARTEL  You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the life out if it, don't you Kramer?   KRAMER CRIES LT. MARTEL  You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't you?   PHONE RINGS OFFICER  Lieutenant, it's for you. LT. MARTEL  Martel...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah.

(singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!   THEY ALL DANCE A FEW STEPS AND THEN AS A POLICE GOES BY THEY LEAVE QUIETLY   KRAMER, JERRY AND GEORGE AT THE HILLS OF L.A. JERRY  So Kramer, what are you going to do?  KRAMER  Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.  GEORGE  Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?  KRAMER  What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?  GEORGE  I'd like to hear that. JERRY  Yeah... KRAMER  Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...  JERRY  Kramer, she was murdered! KRAMER  Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.  GEORGE  As a suspect in a serial killing. KRAMER  Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.  GEORGE  What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.  JERRY  So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?  KRAMER  No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.  GEORGE  Taste this, is this a dill? JERRY  No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.  KRAMER  Ok, it's forgotten. GEORGE  Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy. JERRY  Well, take it easy. KRAMER  Yeah, ok. GEORGE  Yeah, take care. Stay in touch. KRAMER  Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...  JERRY  Oh, no... GEORGE  No, you're crushing my sandwich.  JERRY AND GEORGE AT THE HOTEL. GEORGE IS KICKING THE TUCKED COVERS.  JERRY  Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.   BACK TO JERRY'S APARTMENT. GEORGE AND JERRY ARE WATCHING TV.  GEORGE  Mint? JERRY  No thanks. GEORGE  I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.  JERRY  It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.  GEORGE  Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?  JERRY  No, I don't. GEORGE  You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.  JERRY  Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.  GEORGE  I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.  JERRY  How much did you wound up tipping her?  GEORGE  Oh my God, I forgot! JERRY  Well, communism didn't work.  KRAMER WALKS IN KRAMER  Hey!  KRAMER GOES TO THE FRIDGE KRAMER  Any mustard? This is empty. JERRY  Yeah, there's a new one in there. KRAMER  No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?  JERRY  Help yourself. KRAMER  Yeah, all right. GEORGE  Kramer, what are you doing here? KRAMER  Getting something to eat. JERRY  Kramer, here!  JERRY THROWS THE APARTMENT KEYS TO KRAMER. KRAMER WALKS OUT AND COMES BACK WITH HIS KEYS. HE THROWS THEM TO THE TABLE KNOCKING JERRY'S SODA.  ACTION NEWS. KEITH MORRISON. NEWSCASTER  Authorities exposed today, that the latest suspect in the smog strangling was apprehended this week on an unrelated charge, but somehow managed to escape from the police car, in which he was being held. Tobias Lehigh Nagy, who is also wanted in connection with a series of unrelated slains in the North West is still at large, his whereabouts unknown. He's described as 5'5\" bald and reputedly a very generous tipper.   (Comedy club)  The thing about L.A. to me, that kind of threw me, was when they have these smog alerts out there and they actually recommend that people stay indoors during the smog alert. Now, maybe I'm way off, but don't you think, wouldn't you assume, that the air in the house pretty much comes from the air in the city where the house is? I mean what do they think, that we live in a jar with couple of holes punched in the top? What the hell is going on out there? It's very strange, do you realize that it's now possible for parents to say to their children \"All right kids, I want you in the house and get some fresh air! Summer vacation, everybody indoors.\"     THE END>",

        "text": "  THE PITCH Written by   Larry David   (At club bar)  Jerry and George are talking. Stu and Jay enter. STU  Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC.  JERRY  Hi. STU  Could we speak for a few moments? JERRY  Sure. JAY  Hi, Jay Crespi. JERRY  Hello. GEORGE  Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I? JAY  That's right. GEORGE  I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.  JAY  Mm, I'm not- JERRY  George- GEORGE  (backing off) Huh? All right, fine.  STU  First of all, that was a terrific show.  JERRY  Oh thank you very much. STU  And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something. JERRY  Really? Wow. STU  So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it. JERRY  I'd be very interested in something like that.  STU  Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.  They start to exit. JERRY  Okay. Great. Thanks. STU  It was very nice meeting you. JERY  Thank you. JAY  Nice meeting you. JERRY  Nice meeting you.  (George returns) GEORGE  What was that all about? JERRY  They said they were interested in me.  GEORGE  For what? JERRY  You know, a TV show. GEORGE  Your own show? JERRY  Yeah, I guess so. GEORGE  They want you to do a TV show? JERRY  Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas. GEORGE  Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics. JERRY  Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?  GEORGE  Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.  JERRY  But gymnastics is not for everybody.  GEORGE  I know, but he's your son. JERRY  So what? GEORGE  All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store. JERRY  Yeah and...? GEORGE  And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives. JERRY  What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives? GEORGE  Why not? JERRY  So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.  GEORGE  I know, but antiques are very popular right now.  JERRY  No they're not, they used to be. GEORGE  Oh yeah, like you know. JERRY  Oh like you do.  (Jerry's Apartment) KRAMER  ...And you're the manager of the circus.  JERRY  A circus? KRAMER  Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head. JERRY  I don't think so. KRAMER  Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks. JERRY  I don't think the network will go for it.  KRAMER  Why not? JERRY  Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.  KRAMER  Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a \"can't miss.\" NEWMAN  Kramer. JERRY  Hello Newman. NEWMAN  Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.  KRAMER  All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)  TOGETHER  Yeah, sure. JERRY  What's this all about? NEWMAN  We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.  JERRY  I didn't know you had a motorctcle.  NEWMAN  Well my girlfriend had one. JERRY  You have a girlfriend? NEWMAN  I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.  JERRY  I never remember you with a girl. NEWMAN  Nevertheless, ... JERRY  This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.  NEWMAN  Don't say anything. JERRY  All right.  (Kramer enters) JERRY  You know you're getting gypped over here.  KRAMER  Really, Ah, NEWMAN  We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.  KRAMER  Oh, stop saying 'reneging\". NEWMAN  Well you're reneging. KRAMER  I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.  (they try to exchange items but won't let go) NEWMAN  All right give it to me. let go ...  KRAMER  You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)  JERRY  Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!  NEWMAN  Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)  JERRY  Does that thing work? KRAMER  Nah.  At Monks.  (Jerry and George enter.) JERRY  ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?  GEORGE  Really? JERRY  Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.  GEORGE  I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.  GEORGE  So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?  JERRY  No, nothing. GEORGE  Why don't they have salsa on the table?  JERRY  What do you need salsa for? GEORGE  Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.  JERRY  You know why? Because people like to say \"salsa.\" \"Excuse me, do you have salsa?\" \"We need more salsa.\" \"Where is the salsa? No salsa?\"  GEORGE  You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) \"I wanted seltzer, not salsa.\"  JERRY  \"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!\" GEORGE  See, this should be a show. This is the show.  JERRY  What? GEORGE  This. Just talking. JERRY  (dismissing) Yeah, right. GEORGE  I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.  JERRY  Just talking? Well what's the show about?  GEORGE  It's about nothing. JERRY  No story? GEORGE  No forget the story. JERRY  You've got to have a story. GEORGE  Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show. JERRY  And who is on the show? Who are the characters?  GEORGE  I could be a character. JERRY  You? GEORGE  Yeah. You could base a character on me.  JERRY  So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?  GEORGE  Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, \"You know you're a quite a character.\"  JERRY  And who else is on the show? GEORGE  Elaine could be a character. Kramer..  JERRY  Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.  GEORGE  Right. JERRY  And it's about nothing? GEORGE  Absolutely nothing. JERRY  So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.  GEORGE  We go into NBC. JERRY  \"We\"? Since when are you a writer?  GEORGE  (Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.  JERRY  You want to go with me to NBC? GEORGE  Yeah. I think we really go something here.  JERRY  What do we got? GEORGE  An idea. JERRY  What idea? GEORGE  An idea for the show. JERRY  I still don't know what the idea is.  GEORGE  It's about nothing. JERRY  Right. GEORGE  Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.  JERRY  So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.  GEORGE  Exactly. JERRY  They say, \"What's your show about?\" I say, \"Nothing.\"  GEORGE  There you go.  (A moment passes) JERRY  (Nodding) I think you may have something there.   (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's explaining George's idea to Kramer) JERRY  So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.  KRAMER  (Thinks) No, I don't think so. JERRY  What do you mean you don't think so?  KRAMER  I don't like it. JERRY  I don't understand. What don't you like about it?  KRAMER  I don't like the idea of a character based on me.  JERRY  Why not? KRAMER  well it just doesn't sit well. JERRY  You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.  KRAMER  That's your problem, buddy. JERRY  I don't understand what the big deal is.  KRAMER  Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.  JERRY  Whatever you want. KRAMER  I get to play Kramer. JERRY  You can't play Kramer. KRAMER  I am Kramer. JERRY  But you can't act. KRAMER  Phew!  (Newman enters) JERRY  Okay, fine. We'll use Newman. KRAMER  Newman? NEWMAN  Use me for what? JERRY  Nothin' What do you want? NEWMAN  Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?  KRAMER  Yeah. That's strange. NEWMAN  A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.  KRAMER  That's queer uh? NEWMAN  I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.  KRAMER  Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.  NEWMAN  You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?  JERRY  Buyer beware. NEWMAN  Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?  KRAMER  No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.  NEWMAN  No, but there's karma, Kramer. JERRY  Karma Kramer? NEWMAN  And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)   (Scene ends)  ( NBC reception area)  (Jerry and George are waiting) JERRY  (To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?  GEORGE  (Nervous) Nothing. JERRY  You sure? You look a little pale. GEORGE  No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.  JERRY  What, are you nervous? GEORGE  No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!  JERRY  What? GEORGE  I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.  JERRY  This was your idea! GEORGE  What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.  JERRY  Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.  GEORGE  They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.  JERRY  I told you not to come. GEORGE  I need some water. I gotta get some water.  JERRY  They'll give us water in there. GEORGE  Really? That's pretty good.  (Jerry looks into hallway) JERRY  Oh God, it's Joe Devola. GEORGE  Who? JERRY  This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.  JERRY  Oh God he saw me. DEVOLA  Hello Jerry. JERRY  Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING? DEVOLA  You're under no obligation to shake my hand.  JERRY  Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.  DEVOLA  Why shouldn't I look good? JERRY  Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?  DEVOLA  You want to hit me? JERRY  What are you doing here? DEVOLA  I dreopped a script off. JERRY  AH, GOOD FOR YOU.  (they stare at each other) JERRY  Well, ... DEVOLA  You don't have to say anything. JERRY  No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.  DEVOLA  Why? JERRY  Kramer's party. DEVOLA  Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?  JERRY  No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.  DEVOLA  Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.  JERRY  No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.   (Crazy Joe leaves) JERRY  Give my best to Hinckley. GEORGE  What was that? JERRY  I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...   (before he can dial) RECEPTIONIST  They're ready for you. GEORGE  Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?  JERRY  Relax. Who are they? GEORGE  Yeah, they're not better than me. JERRY  Course not. GEORGE  Who are they? JERRY  They're nobody. GEORGE  What about me? JERRY  What about you? GEORGE  Why them? Why not me? JERRY  Why not you? GEORGE  I'm as good as them. JERRY  Better. GEORGE  You really think so? JERRY  No.  (The door opens, and, from Jerry and George's point of view, four executives stand up)   (Scene ends)  ( NBC president's office)  (Stu Chermak, Susan Ross, Jay Crespi, and Russell Dalrymple, the head of the network, are all talking with Jerry and George)  STU  (To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.  GEORGE  The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.  JERRY  Yeah, it's one of my favorites. RUSSELL  What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?  GEORGE  (Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, \"La Cocina.\" ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.  JERRY  Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?  GEORGE  Pepe. JERRY  Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.  SUSANEWMAN  Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?  GEORGE  No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.  RUSSELL  So, what have you two come up with?  JERRY  Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-  GEORGE  (Interrupting) May I? JERRY  Go ahead. GEORGE  I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING.  RUSSELL  Nothing? GEORGE  (Smiling) Nothing. RUSSELL  (Unimpressed) What does that mean?  GEORGE  The show is about nothing. JERRY  (To George) Well, it's not about nothing.  GEORGE  (To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.  JERRY  Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.   (Jerry and George glare at each other. The receptionist enters)  RECEPTIONIST  Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.  RUSSELL  I'll call back.  (Receptionist leaves) GEORGE  (Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?  RUSSELL  (Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.  GEORGE  Is it with a \"y\"? RUSSELL  No. SUSANEWMAN  What's the premise? JERRY  ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.  GEORGE  Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.  RUSSELL  You read? You read on the show? JERRY  Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.  RUSSELL  All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?  GEORGE  Oh, no. No stories. RUSSELL  No stories? So, what is it? GEORGE  (Showing an example) What'd you do today?  RUSSELL  I got up and came to work. GEORGE  There's a show. That's a show. RUSSELL  (Confused) How is that a show? JERRY  Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.  GEORGE  No, no, no. Nothing happens. JERRY  Well, something happens. RUSSELL  Well, why am I watching it? GEORGE  Because it's on TV. RUSSELL  (Threatening) Not yet. GEORGE  Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?   (A moment passes) JERRY  (To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus..   (Monks) JERRY  I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.  GEORGE  . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.  JERRY  Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?  GEORGE  Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.  JERRY  IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE! GEORGE  Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.  JERRY  Oh, I forgot to call Kramer. GEORGE  Wait a minute let me call Susan. JERRY  No, no this is more important. GEORGE  She might be leaving to work any minute.  JERRY  No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.  GEORGE  No.  (they race to the pay phone)  (Paris hotel room - Dr. Reston and Elaine are kissing) ELAINE  What is it? DR. RESTON  I was just thinking about this patient of mine.  ELAINE  What? DR. RESTON  Just wondering if he's taking his medication.  ELAINE  Well, come on we're on vacation.  (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)  KRAMER  Yeah (to buzzer) GEORGE  (OC) It's George. JERRY  And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.  KRAMER  Whoa, back up a second. JERRY  Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.  KRAMER  Why would you think I would invite him?  JERRY  I just a ssumed, ... KRAMER  Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.   (George and Susan enter) GEORGE  Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.  JERRY  Of course. How are you? SUSAN  Fine, it's good to see you. GEORGE  And this is Kramer. SUSAN  Hello. GEORGE  All right go ahead Susan, tell him.  JERRY  Tell me what? SUSAN  Well, I, (phone rings) JERRY  Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.  TEL  Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.  JERRY  Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.  TEL  Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.  JERRY  Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.  TEL  No. JERRY  Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)  GEORGE  Well, go ahead, tell him. JERRY  Kramer, are you drinking that milk?  KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  What's the expiration date on that?  KRAMER  September third. JERRY  The third? GEORGE  and SUSAN: The third? KRAMER  Um, Uh, ugh, ... SUSAN  Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)   (Monk's) GEORGE  I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.  JERRY  I think SHE saw it coming. GEORGE  You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.  JERRY  Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.  GEORGE  What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.  JERRY  Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.  GEORGE  Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.   (Kramer enters with helmet) JERRY  What happened to you? KRAMER  Devola came after me. JERRY  What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?  KRAMER  Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, \"That's what I thin k of your party.\"  JERRY  Boy,that is some kick. KRAMER  Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.  JERRY  Wow, Newman's helmet. GEORGE  Holly. KRAMER  I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.  JERRY  Me, why? KRAMER  He doesn't like you. JERRY  What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.  KRAMER  Pass the cream. GEORGE  Wait a second. (smells it). all right.  THE END>",

JERRY  The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?  KRAMER  No, no, no.  (Jerry notices Kramer's look) JERRY  All right, what is this? KRAMER  what is what? JERRY  All right, very funny. I get it. KRAMER  You're in a weird mood. JERRY  Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.  KRAMER  Fix what? JERRY  Your pants!  (Kramer is startled when he realizes his looks) KRAMER  what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?  JERRY  Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?  KRAMER  No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?  JERRY  Go look at your face in the mirror.  KRAMER  Wha-huh-wha-huh...  (door buzzer) JERRY  yeah? GEORGE  It's George. JERRY  Come on up. KRAMER  I don't believe this. JERRY  You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?  KRAMER  No, I swear. JERRY  I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.   (Enter George) GEORGE  Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.  KRAMER  Me?  (George hands Kramer a paper) GEORGE  Yeah, here you go. KRAMER  What's this? GEORGE  A dry-cleaning bill? JERRY  From that woman at NBC? GEORGE  Yeah. KRAMER  A dry-cleaning bill for what? GEORGE  For vomiting on her vest! KRAMER  Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!  GEORGE  Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!  KRAMER  Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.  GEORGE  Yeah, your milk. JERRY  He drank it. KRAMER  I didn't know. JERRY  All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.  KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  How much was it to clean the vest?  GEORGE  Eighteen dollars. JERRY  Can you get vomit out of suede? GEORGE  I don't know. KRAMER  Yo-yo Ma! JERRY  What? Yo-yo Ma? KRAMER  What about him? JERRY  You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'. GEORGE  What's Yo-yo Ma? JERRY  He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.  GEORGE  All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.  JERRY  I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.  GEORGE  I know! JERRY  That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?  GEORGE  The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network  JERRY  Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!  GEORGE  It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.  KRAMER  Jeez! GEORGE  Anyway.  (Phone rings, Kramer picks up. Answers in Italian.) JERRY  What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today.   (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.  GEORGE  What? JERRY  NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.  GEORGE  They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?  JERRY  I don't know about sixty. GEORGE  Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?  JERRY  Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?  GEORGE  I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.' JERRY  Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!  GEORGE  Oh! JERRY  You know, I think he wears a piece.  GEORGE  Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.   (Street) JERRY  I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.   (He throws his watch in the trash can beside him) GEORGE  What, is that the one your parents gave you?  JERRY  Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.  GEORGE  All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.  JERRY  I'll pay for it. GEORGE  It's not the money! JERRY  Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?   (Both raise their arm to signal a cab.) LEO  Jerry! JERRY  Uncle Leo! LEO  Helloooo! JERRY  Hello there, how're you doing? LEO  Ha ha! How are you? JERRY  Good, good. LEO  How's your mom and dad? JERRY  Good, fine. LEO  What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!  JERRY  Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.  LEO  You know where I just came from?  (He grabs Jerry's forearm.)  Danny Barma. JERRY  Oh, sure. Danny. LEO  He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!   (Leo shakes Jerry around using his grip on Jerry's arm.) JERRY  Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.  (George gets impatient, touches his watch subtly, maybe subconsciously.)  LEO  The funny thing is: I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me: 'You need any pajamas?'  JERRY  I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.  LEO  Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.  JERRY  We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.  LEO  Nobody got a gun to your head! JERRY  Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh. LEO  Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.  JERRY  I'm sorry, really. LEO  You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!  JERRY  Sorry, really.  (Leo turns around and leaves. He passes by the trash can and sees the watch. He picks it up, takes it to his ear, laughs and puts it on. He walks away.)   (Hall out of Kramer's apartment)  (Newman knocks on Kramer's door) KRAMER  Yeah? NEWMAN  Come on, are you ready? Let's go!  (Straightens his tie)  (Kramer opens the door. He has shaving cream on his face.) KRAMER  For what? NEWMAN  What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.  KRAMER  what about? NEWMAN  The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.  KRAMER  I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.  NEWMAN  You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.  KRAMER  Well, I can't! NEWMAN  Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!  KRAMER  Shut up! I'll get my coat!  (Newman enters Kramer's apartment)  Don't step on anything.  (NBC's waiting room) JERRY  You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.  GEORGE  I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.  JERRY  You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go: 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'  GEORGE  Look at this. JERRY  Why didn't you shave this morning?  GEORGE  'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  Because of the day before. It's a long story.   (Jerry looks down the hall.)  Can't get back on schedule. JERRY  Is that Joe Davola?  (Jerry crouches in his seat) GEORGE  It's not him! JERRY  I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.  RECEPTIONIST  Mister Seinfeld? They're ready for you.  JERRY  Oh.  (They get up) GEORGE  Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?   (They walk toward the office) JERRY  All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.  GEORGE  Okay. A little.  (Courthouse waiting room) NEWMAN  Okay, you're all set? You got your story?  KRAMER  No. NEWMAN  When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.  KRAMER  Uhm... NEWMAN  Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.   (Pause; they're thinking) KRAMER  I never had an air conditioner. NEWMAN  No! That's no reason to kill yourself!  KRAMER  Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?  NEWMAN  Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.  KRAMER  Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.  NEWMAN  No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.  KRAMER  I was never able to become a banker.   (Newman has a revelation.) NEWMAN  Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.  KRAMER  Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.  NEWMAN  You must be banker. KRAMER  MUST be banker. NEWMAN  Okay, we'll go with the banker story.   (NBC office) (I might be missing a line here, I suck at cutting the commercials. If so, please complete.)  GEORGE  The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.   (George is the only one laughing) RUSSEL  And people really have to care about the characters.  GEORGE  Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?  JERRY  Wouldn't tune in. GEORGE  Would they tune in? JERRY  No tune. RUSSEL  We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.  GEORGE  The show will be like a heart attack!  JERRY  Just a huge massive coronary. RUSSEL  So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.  GEORGE  Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.  JERRY  He couldn't believe it. GEORGE  I said, I said: 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'   (Jerry and George laugh)  (Courtroom) POLICE OFFICER  Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide.  JUDGE  And then what happened? POLICE OFFICER  Well, then he became very loud and hysterical. He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go. And when I refused, that's when he began to scream: 'My friend's going to die, my friend's going to die.'   (NBC office) RUSSEL  Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.   (George starts, Jerry starts later, both speak at the same time, nonstop)  GEORGE  Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.  JERRY  We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.  GEORGE  Yeah! STU  Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?   (Pause. George and Jerry are puzzled.)  (Jerry gets it, pokes George.) JERRY  Your off-Broadway play. GEORGE  Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.  JERRY  Hmm, hmm. GEORGE  That's my vow to you. RUSSEL  Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment.   (the lady is Susan)  (George and Jerry both speak at the same time, nonstop) GEORGE  Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.  JERRY  Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.  RUSSEL  So, let's make a pilot.  (Hand shakes)  (Courtroom) NEWMAN  I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.  JUDGE  I don't understand. NEWMAN  You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...  KRAMER  Yo-yo Ma! NEWMAN  So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.  JUDGE  So then he didn't kill himself. NEWMAN  No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today   (Stands up, points to Kramer.)  (dramatically) sitting right over there! And he can corroborate my entire testimony.   (NBC's waiting room)  (Jerry and George are coming out of the office) GEORGE  See? JERRY  Yeah! GEORGE  I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!  JERRY  Now, all we gotta do is write it. GEORGE  Yes! How're we gonna do that?  (Enter Susan) SUSAN  Hey! Congratulations! JERRY  Thanks. GEORGE  Oh, thank you. JERRY  Thank you, thanks. GEORGE  Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.  SUSAN  No. RECEPTIONIST  Mister Seinfeld, you have a phone call.  JERRY  Phone call? Who knows I'm here?  (He picks up the phone)  Hello? Mom? How'd you know I was here? Oh, I was not rude to him, that is baloney! I couldn't talk! I couldn't talk! I had a meeting! I don't know... he-he went off on something about pajamas!  GEORGE  When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.  SUSAN  Oh, it was only vomit. GEORGE  Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.  SUSAN  Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber: yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*  GEORGE  No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.  SUSAN  Well, it was eighteen dollars. GEORGE  Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.  SUSAN  Yeah. Call me. GEORGE  All right, great. SUSAN  Bye. JERRY  Bye thanks. GEORGE  Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  I offered to pay. She should've said no.  JERRY  She did, you insisted. GEORGE  Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.  JERRY  Nah! GEORGE  How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?  JERRY  oh, I d-I don't know. I d--- GEORGE  Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.  JERRY  Okay. GEORGE  All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.   (Coffee shop) GEORGE  Thirteen thousand? JERRY  Thirteen thousand. GEORGE  a piece? JERRY  No, for both! GEORGE  That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.  JERRY  Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?  GEORGE  Well, he does. JERRY  You're nuts! GEORGE  I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?  JERRY  He's somebody. GEORGE  What about me? JERRY  You're nobody. GEORGE  Why him? Why not me? JERRY  He's good, you're not. GEORGE  I'm better than him. JERRY  You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!  GEORGE  What? Where? Where? JERRY  Outside! I saw him outside!  (Europe) *I think.*  (Elaine is kissing with a guy. He stops. She keeps kissing him, then stops.)  ELAINE  what is it? BOYFRIEND  Oh, it's this patient. ELAINE  Again? BOYFRIEND  I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication.  ELAINE  Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.  BOYFRIEND  Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous.   (Elaine turns around, rolls her eyes.)  (Coffee shop) JERRY  Go outside and see if he's still there.  GEORGE  I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.  JERRY  Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.   (A cop sits down at the counter.) GEORGE  Tell the cop. JERRY  Good idea.  (Walks to counter)  Excuse me officer. There's a guy outside and he's kind of a nut job and I think he's waiting to beat me up. If you could just walk me outside and wait till I get into a cab.  COP  Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.  JERRY  Thanks.  Jerry waits a while and realizes he has to go sit back with George and wait over there.)  JERRY  He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.   (Looks over at the cop)  Hey! He's looking at the menu now. What's he looking at the menu for?!  GEORGE  I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.   (Jerry gets up and walks to the counter) JERRY  What are you doing? COP  What? JERRY  What, are you ordering food now? COP  Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.  JERRY  What happened to the muffin? COP  I got a little hungry. JERRY  All of a sudden you get hungry? COP  Yeah! You got a problem with that?  JERRY  No! Enjoy your lunch.  (Goes back toward the booth and stops.)  You know a muffin can be very filling.  (Keeps walking to the booth) He's getting a sandwich now! GEORGE  I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.  JERRY  All of a sudden he gets hungry. GEORGE  You know, a muffin can be very filling.  JERRY  I know!  (Courtroom) NEWMAN  Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?  KRAMER  What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?  NEWMAN  You know what I mean. KRAMER  I was very upset that day. NEWMAN  And why was that? KRAMER  Would you let me say it? Let me talk!  NEWMAN  All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.  KRAMER  All right. NEWMAN  Okay. KRAMER  I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.  NEWMAN  And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.  KRAMER  Uh, yeah. NEWMAN  It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...  JUDGE  Mister Newman. NEWMAN  Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.  JUDGE  Uh, continue. NEWMAN  As you were saying, Mister Kramer...  KRAMER  What was the question? NEWMAN  You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.  KRAMER  Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said: 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'  NEWMAN  But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?  KRAMER  I don't know. NEWMAN  It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?  JUDGE  Uh, could you get to the speeding?  NEWMAN  Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?  KRAMER  Phone call? NEWMAN  Yes, a phone call! KRAMER  From who? NEWMAN  From me! KRAMER  From you? NEWMAN  Yes, from me!! I called you remember?  KRAMER  You called me? NEWMAN  Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?  KRAMER  what? NEWMAN  You were going to...  (Mimmicks hanging himself, growing hysterical as only Newman can)   You were going to do something  (Mimmicks stabbing himself in stomach and jerking the knife around) to yourself! You were going to do something to yourself! Remember the banking? The banking, about the banking, about the banking!!!  JUDGE  I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---  NEWMAN  Yes, the banker!!! KRAMER  What banking? NEWMAN  A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...  JUDGE  That's enough already. NEWMAN  Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.  KRAMER  I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo! NEWMAN  You shut up! I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.  JUDGE  That'll be seventy-five dollars. NEWMAN  What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!   (They fall on their backs. Kramer knocks the flag on judge.)   (Coffee shop) (Missing another line here as well. Told you, I sucked at cutting the commercials, didn't I? Please complete again. *between asterisks are only guesses. Correct if not accurate.)  *JERRY  Do you see him? GEORGE  I'm not* sure. JERRY  Well, either you see him or you don't.  GEORGE  All right. I don't. JERRY  What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!  GEORGE  What's with this guy?  (Jerry walks to the counter) JERRY  Did you just order coffee? COP  Yeah. JERRY  This is really too much. COP  What is your problem? JERRY  Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.  COP  Well, you're just gonna have to wait.   (Enter Kramer and Newman) KRAMER  Never said anything about the banking.  NEWMAN  You're off your rocker. JERRY  Hey you guys! KRAMER  Hey! JERRY  What are you doing here? KRAMER  What are YOU doing here? JERRY  Hey, is Davola outside? KRAMER  Davola? JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  No, I didn't see him. NEWMAN  Crazy Joe Davola? GEORGE  Jerry, yours is eleven dollars. JERRY  Eleven dollars for what? GEORGE  Muffin, sandwich and coffee! JERRY  Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.  KRAMER  You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?  JERRY  No. NEWMAN  Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?  GEORGE  What's the difference? The money is not important.  JERRY  Hey Newman, is that your red car? NEWMAN  Yeah. JERRY  I think you're getting a ticket. NEWMAN  Deh! KRAMER  Run, run! Go, go, go!  (Newman runs outside) NEWMAN  Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.  KRAMER  I saw the whole thing! JERRY  Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.  GEORGE  Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.  JERRY  Oh, like you know what you're talking about!  GEORGE  No, YOU do!   THE END>",

You know, you're watching the show. You're into the story. There's like five minutes left and suddenly you realize, \"Hey, they can't make it.\" Timmy's still stuck in the cave. There's no way they wrap this up in five minutes. I mean the whole reason you watch a TV show is because it ends. If I want a long boring story with no point to it, I have my life. A comedian can't do that, see. I can't go, \"A man walks into a bar with a pig under his arm - Can you come back next week?\"   (In Jerry's Car) JERRY  George and I went up to NBC and we told them our idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.  HELEN  And they liked your idea? JERRY  Yeah. MORTY  What'ya got leather seats here? HELEN  Since when is George a writer? JERRY  What writer? It's a sitcom. HELEN  That's exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?  JERRY  Soon, there's a couple of problems.  MORTY  Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.  JERRY  What do you expect? It's airline food.  MORTY  . . . give you fish. JERRY  How could you eat fish on a plane?  MORTY  because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.  HELEN  What kind of problems? JERRY  Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.  HELEN  What? He's not even working. MORTY  George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.  HELEN  Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.  JERRY  We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.   (George's car) GEORGE  So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.  SUSAN  You're passing? GEORGE  Well, it's . . . much too low. SUSAN  Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?  GEORGE  Ah, yeah, . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.  SUSAN  Because you know, because this is your first show this is a pretty standard deal.  GEORGE  Standard? SUSAN  Yeah. GEORGE  Is Ted Danson's deal standard? SUSAN  Ted Danson? GEORGE  You know, the guy from Cheers. SUSAN  Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.  GEORGE  I didn't say I was Ted Danson. SUSAN  All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.  GEORGE  - SUSAN  Oh, uh, before I forget, . . . cigars. A present from my father.  GEORGE  Oh, uh, do I have to write him a note or something?  SUSAN  Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.  GEORGE  But what do I say in the note? SUSAN  Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.  GEORGE  Oh, uh, yeah, I'm a writer, (laughs)   (Jerry's car at gas station) HELEN  Were you waiting long at the gate?  JERRY  I don't even know? HELEN  Where's that watch we bought you? JERRY  Oh uh  (Flashback to street) JERRY  That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)  GEORGE  That's the one your parents bought you?  JERRY  Yeah, but it never worked.  (Back to present day in car at gas station) JERRY  . . . it's being fixed. MORTY  I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where I got it.  JERRY  It's at the jeweler. MORTY  You send me the bill. JERRY  I'm not sending you the bill. HELEN  That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.  GSUSAN  That's uh, $18.50. MORTY  Here, I got it. JERRY  What are you talking about? It's my car. You can pay for the gas.  MORTY  No, no put it away . . . JERRY  Dad! MORTY  Stop it. JERRY  I have money. I make money. MORTY  Yeah, yeah, you make money. JERRY  You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?  HELEN  No, I don't think that. JERRY  Yes you do. That's what you both think.  MORTY  I'll pay. JERRY  I'm paying. MORTY  Get out of here. JERRY  You're not paying MORTY  Jerry please, JERRY  You're not doing this.  (both fighting to pay)  (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?  MORTY  Nothing nothing. JERRY  Leave it. What about your back? HELEN  Morty, what are you doing? MORTY  All right, all right. JERRY  You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey, Morty. MORTY  Hey, Mr. Kramer. KRAMER  Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. HELEN  What happened to you? KRAMER  Well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.  HELEN  What guy? KRAMER  Crazy Joe Devola. HELEN  Why? KRAMER  Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and Jerry tipped him off.  JERRY  Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?  JERRY  I didn't know he wasn't invited MORTY  Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?  HELEN  So why did you say anything? JERRY  It was a mistake. MORTY  They're good around the house and they're good for outside.  HELEN  Are you okay? KRAMER  Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week - but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion  HELEN  So what's the matter with this Devola guy?  JERRY  He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.  KRAMER  Oh, yeah. He's after Jerry now. JERRY  Kramer!! HELEN  He's what?! JERRY  He's joking. HELEN  He's after you? JERRY  Nooo. HELEN  Why is he after you? JERRY  He's not after me. HELEN  Morty, did you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.  HELEN  I'll make a few phone calls. JERRY  Who are you going to call? MORTY  What are you worried about? HELEN  I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.  JERRY  I didn't do anything. HELEN  Well you must have done something.  JERRY  No, he just doesn't like me. HELEN  Doesn't like you? How can anyone not like you?  JERRY  You know, it seems impossible. HELEN  Doesn't like you? How can that be?  JERRY  Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.  HELEN  Huh, Jerry, don't say that. JERRY  It's true. HELEN  No, it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?  MORTY  Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.  HELEN  Kramer? KRAMER  Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?  JERRY  Um, huh, I don't have my watch on. It's being fixed.  KRAMER  When you getting it back? JERRY  Uh, next week. KRAMER  Next week? How come it's taking so long?  JERRY  Huh? KRAMER  I said how come it's taking so long?  JERRY  I don't know. They're backed up. KRAMER  wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?  JERRY  Where'd I take it? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing with knife) Um, to that place on, uh Columbus and uh, 85th. Okay?  KRAMER  Jimmy Sherman's? JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.  JERRY  No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him  KRAMER  I'd be happy to. JERRY  He's a friend of mine. JERRY  I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.  KRAMER  Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy.  MORTY  Give me the receipt. KRAMER  I'll get that too. (exits) JERRY  Be right back. (follows Kramer out)   (In the hallway) JERRY  . . . I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me so don't mention it again, okay!  KRAMER  All right. JERRY  All right. KRAMER  Wait, wait , . . .  (Jerry reenters his own apartment) HELEN  What was that about? KRAMER  Oh, oh, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.  HELEN  How can anyone not like him.  (Back doctor's office) MORTY  Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.  RECEPTIONIST  Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill in this form(?).  MORTY  All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.  RECEPTIONIST  I know. It's very long. MORTY  Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. What do they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. My back was fine.  HELEN  Well, it's not the sofa. MORTY  You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.  HELEN  We got it at Sullivan's. It's a good store.  MORTY  One day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.  HELEN  Leo says he's the best there is. MORTY  Leo, I'm listening to Leo now! HELEN  You're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?  MORTY  Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.  RECEPTIONIST  Julie, you want to take him back?  (Jerry's Apartment) JERRY  You what? You passed? How could you do that?  GEORGE  Jerry, my young friend, you are so naïve. You are so so naïve. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I am negotiating. Negotiation, this is what you do in business.  JERRY  Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, they go to the next show.  GEORGE  Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ooooo they're not going to do the show.  JERRY  We're lucky they are even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!  GEORGE  Oooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!  JERRY  Well, I think you're wrong. GEORGE  Well, we'll just see. JERRY  Yes we will. GEORGE  Yes we will. JERRY  I just said that. GEORGE  I know you did. JERRY  So good for you. GEORGE  So good for you. JERRY  We'll you're repeating everything I'm saying?  GEORGE  We'll you're repeating everything I'm saying?  JERRY  Well George is an idiot. GEORGE  Well George,,. . . .  (Doctor's examination room) MORTY  All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . . Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.  HELEN  (enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.  MORTY  Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.  HELEN  Well the doctor must be busy. MORTY  Well what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. uh, look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel .  NURSE  Hello, Mr. Seinfeld. MORTY  I thought you forgot about me. NURSE  We didn't forget.  (pulls apart the Velcro blood pressure band) MORTY  Ah! It's Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.  NURSE  Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays.  MORTY  Leave all my stuff here? NURSE  Leave it.  (They exit)  (Jerry's Apartment) GEORGE  Okay, by the way. Do you want a box of Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.  JERRY  No I don't want them.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?  GEORGE  Here you go. KRAMER  A box of cigars? GEORGE  Yep, KRAMER  Oh, yeah? GEORGE  The kind that Castro smokes. You can't buy them anywhere.  KRAMER  Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)   (Buzzer) JERRY  Yes? VOICE  Federal Express. JERRY  Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.  KRAMER  Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar into the building.  JERRY  You think so? KRAMER  Federal Express? Of course. It's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it might be a murderer.  JERRY  So you want us to abolish all home package deliveries.  KRAMER  Yes. It's dangerous.  (Knock on the door - Kramer prepares for a fight) JERRY  Who is it? VOICE  Federal Express. KRAMER  Okay, . . .  (Elaine enters) ALL  Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! ELAINE  Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.  KRAMER  I came back for you. ELAINE  Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer) JERRY  I missed you. ELAINE  Really? JERRY  Yeah, . . .  (lots of missing you talk) KRAMER  I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.  ELAINE  Who's suitcase is this? JERRY  Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.  ELAINE  Oh, golly, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.  GEORGE  Boy, you look really great. JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  You lie. GEORGE  No, no you really look great. ELAINE  Hu hu, ha. JERRY  So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?  ELAINE  Oh, he's fine. JERRY  Things are good? ELAINE  Yeah, you know (scratches cheek) JERRY  Uh oh. ELAINE  What, Uh ih? JERRY  Did you see that? GEORGE  Yeah, I saw it. ELAINE  What? JERRY  It's a tell. You gotta tell. ELAINE  What tell? What's a tell? JERRY  When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.  ELAINE  Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?  JERRY  Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out.  ELAINE  How high did I go? GEORGE  You almost did the nose. JERRY  What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display.  GEORGE  I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.  JERRY  You're off bread. . . . So what happened is it over?  ELAINE  Well not quite. JERRY  Why not? ELAINE  He was my psychiatrist, you know. He knows all my patterns. In my relationships I always try to find some reason to leave, so as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.  GEORGE  What do you mean - \"Not letting you?\"  ELAINE  He has this power over me, okay. He has this way of manipulating every little word I say. He's like a Svenjolly.  GEORGE  Svengali. ELAINE  What did I say? JERRY  Svenjolly. ELAINE  Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.  JERRY  George? GEORGE  Svenjolly. ELAINE  I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.  JERRY  So maybe he's got like a cheerful mental hold on you.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  You know I can't find a match anywhere.  GEORGE  You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.  ELAINE  No, it's not going to work with this guy.  GEORGE  Well, you just tell him an old boyfriend has come back into your life.  ELAINE  I don't think so. JERRY  Nice try. GEORGE  Took a shot. KRAMER  This is a good cigar (hair is on fire) . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom)   (Doctor's examining room. Morty enters) MORTY  So, when do I get to see the doctor?  NURSE  He'll be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed. (leaves)  MORTY  (checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. MY WALLET'S GONE!   MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.  NURSE  Are you sure? MORTY  Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?   (doctor enters) DR. DEMBROW  Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Devro MORTY  I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.  DR. DEMBROW  Why, I don't see how something like that could have happened.  MORTY  Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.  HELEN  (enters) What's going on? MORTY  They stole my wallet. HELEN  What? MORTY  While I was in getting X-Rayed. DR. DEMBROW  All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but would you like me to look over these X-Rays?  MORTY  What kind of clip joint are you running here?  DR. DEMBROW  All right, fine. (leaves) HELEN  The least you could have done was hear your diagnosis.  MORTY  I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.  HELEN  You came all the way from Florida to see him.  MORTY  I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.   (Dr. Reston's office) ELAINE  I am sorry but there's somebody else.  DR. RESTON Huh, huh. ELAINE  Well it's nothing I planned on happeniong, you knoe. It just kind of happened.  DR. RESTON Tell me about him. ELAINE  Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy. Really.  DR. RESTON Yes, I assumed he was a guy. And you've known him how long?  ELAINE  . . . Years. Years, um, we've been close friends and then recently something you know just happened.  DR. RESTON You mean sexually? ELAINE  Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.  (phone rings) DR. RESTON Excuse me. Yes, Oh yes, Bobo. No it's just east of madison. Around 4:00 will be fine. All right Bobo. (hangs up) . . .I'm sorry where were we?  ELAINE  Well, I was just telling you about this other guy.  DR. RESTON Elaine, do you remember your dream where you have a sexual encounter with a Chinese woman?  ELAINE  Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) ha um. DR. RESTON Elaine, I'm concerned about you. ELAINE  Oh, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm good. I'm very good, I mean I'm really very very good.  DR. RESTON Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?  ELAINE  . . . no. DR. RESTON And how often have you been seeing, . . .? I'm sorry what is his name?  ELAINE  His name? DR. RESTON Yes, his name. ELAINE  Um, what's the difference? DR. RESTON Are you afraid to tell me his name?  ELAINE  No, no, I just don't see how that's relevant.  DR. RESTON It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.  ELAINE  Uh, his name, uh, Idon't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.  DR. RESTON Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?  ELAINE  Oh, I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.  DR. RESTON Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.  ELAINE  What? DR. RESTON I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It is very important that I speak to him.  ELAINE  Oh, no, no no no, I can't do that.  DR. RESTON You can do it and you will do it. ELAINE  No, I can't. DR. RESTON You can and you will. ELAINE  Okay, okay. I'll have Kramer give you a call.   (Restaurant) JERRY  So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?  MORTY  I wouldn't give him the satiusfaction.  HELEN  Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?  MORTY  What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?  HELEN  Well. You could have taken it with you.  MORTY  Oh, yeah, I'd be lying on the X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.   (Leo enter) LEO  Hello, ,hello. JERRY  Hi Uncle Leo. LEO  I just talked to Dr. Denvro's son. He said they almost had to call the police.  MORTY  What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.  LEO  You know how hard it was for me to get thjat appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.  MORTY  All right, Leo. LEO  You walked out without paying. MORTY  How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.  LEO  Well, I hope you sent him a check.  MORTY  What for? LEO  What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.  MORTY  That's the second time you said \"personal favor\". Why do you keep saying that?  LEO  I said it once. MORTY  Twice! And Dembrowdoesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.  HELEN  Leo, where did you get that watch?  LEO  You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?  HELEN  Doesn't that watch look like the one we gave Jerry.  JERRY  Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a . .  (looking at watch) JERRY  Can we continue this another time. THE END>",

        "text": "  THE WATCH Written by   Larry David   (Comedy club) JERRY  It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. \"It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad.\" But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, \"I refuse to put any thought into this at all.\" Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?   (Restaurant)  Jerry, Helen and Morty Seinfeld and uncle Leo are having dinner.  MORTY  (to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day. JERRY  Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.  Morty sits, brooding a little. A hostess, Naomi, passes the table.   Helen watches her. HELEN  (indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.  JERRY  She's okay. HELEN  Just okay? JERRY  She's nice. HELEN  She's better than nice. JERRY  She's all right. HELEN  She's beautiful. JERRY  She's not beautiful. HELEN  I think she's beautiful. JERRY  So you ask her out. HELEN  I'm not gonna ask her out. JERRY  Why not? HELEN  If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you. JERRY  She's pretty. She's not beautiful.  HELEN  I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.  JERRY  I think that's a little extreme. LEO  (grudgingly) She's awright. MORTY  (oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.   (George's Car) GEORGE  He said what? SUSAN  \"The hell with them.\" GEORGE  \"The hell with them?\" SUSAN  Those were his exact words. GEORGE  (worried) Oh boy. SUSAN  He said, \"We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?\"  GEORGE  (still worried) He was pretty emphatic?  SUSAN  Pounded on his desk. GEORGE  Pounded? SUSAN  (tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.  GEORGE  (getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end. SUSAN  You said it was insulting. GEORGE  I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.  SUSAN  Well, there's nothing I can do. GEORGE  Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it? SUSAN  Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.  GEORGE  Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him? SUSAN  You'll have to wait til Monday. GEORGE  Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live? SUSAN  (laugh) I can't give you his address.   George looks frustrated for a second, then notices Susan's purse on the dash. He grabs it, Susan grabs it and a struggle ensues. SUSAN  Give it back! GEORGE  Gimme the purse!  (Kramer's Apartment)  Elaine and Kramer sit on the couch. ELAINE  Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that? KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.  ELAINE  Okay. KRAMER  Have we been intimate? ELAINE  Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate. KRAMER  Alright, how often do we do it? ELAINE  Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that? KRAMER  Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that. ELAINE  Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay? KRAMER  (suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles) ELAINE  Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say? KRAMER  I know what I'm gonna say. ELAINE  No, no, but I would like to hear it.  KRAMER  No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.   Elaine picks up the phone, while Kramer prepares himself. ELAINE  (dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him.  KRAMER  (playing with his hair) Talk to him.  ELAINE  Hey, how's your hair? KRAMER  Oh, well, yeah, it's good. ELAINE  (handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer. KRAMER  (listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call. ELAINE  (mouths silently) Okay.  Kramer holds on. He begins to sing along with the hold music.  KRAMER  (singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...   He waggles his eyebrows at Elaine, who gives a 'what the hell is he doing?' look. KRAMER  ...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's... ELAINE  (animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends.  KRAMER  ...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...  Elaine signals her approval, indicating that Kramer should keep going.  KRAMER  ...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...  Elaine smiles. KRAMER  ...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.  Elaine looks extremely pleased, she gives Kramer okay gestures.  ELAINE  (mouths silently) That's perfect! KRAMER  If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.  Elaine looks even happier. She slaps Kramer on the arm to indicate he's doing so well. KRAMER  Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)   Elaine's smile begins to look a bit stiff. KRAMER  ...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...   Elaine's face starts to look a bit sick. KRAMER  (listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...  Kramer reaches down and picks up a writing pad, he puts it on his knee. Elaine watches, looking increasingly confused and worried. KRAMER  ... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.  Kramer hangs up the phone. ELAINE  What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here? KRAMER  Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.  ELAINE  (horrified) Get together!! KRAMER  He wants to talk. ELAINE  Well, why didn't you say no!! KRAMER  (momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting.  Elaine flops back into the couch, let down again by Kramer.  ELAINE  (frustration) Ugh!  (Restaurant)  Naomi, the hostess, stands by the Seinfeld's table. NAOMI  Did you enjoy your poisson? HELEN  It was... different. NAOMI  (to Jerry) And how was yours? JERRY  Ah, very good. NAOMI  You should try our mousse. (a little flirtatious) It'll change your life expectancy. JERRY  No thanks, just the check.  Naomi leaves. HELEN  What's the matter with you? JERRY  What? HELEN  Why didn't you flirt with her? JERRY  Come on. HELEN  She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?  JERRY  What am I gonna say? HELEN  You just sat there. JERRY  Well, you made me uncomfortable. HELEN  You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?  LEO  (to Morty) Where's the bathroom? JERRY  In the back, on your right.  Leo gets up and leaves. The busboy brings the check to the table. As he puts it down, Morty takes hold of it. Jerry grabs it too. A tug of war develops. JERRY  Dad! MORTY  Will you stop it Jerry. Let go. HELEN  Jerry. JERRY  Will you let me pay just once. MORTY  You're out of your mind. JERRY  How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!  MORTY  Don't worry about it. JERRY  What're you gonna do? MORTY  What's the difference, we'll figure something out.  HELEN  (to Jerry) You're not paying.  Jerry releases his grip, allowing a triumphant Morty to take the check.  JERRY  Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.  Jerry walks away. Morty reads the check, with Helen leaning to read it too. MORTY  How the hell am I gonna pay for this?   (Restaurant Bathroom)  Jerry enters, to find Leo washing his hands. Leo notices Jerry in the mirror. LEO  They give you some portion here, huh?  JERRY  Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to  a meeting. LEO  (preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.  JERRY  So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?  LEO  Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.  JERRY  Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift. LEO  Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.   Leo begins to head for the door. Jerry walks backwards, keeping pace with him. JERRY  Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.  LEO  (sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)  Leo opens the door and begins to exit. Jerry grabs him by the arm.  JERRY  (pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.  (Apartment Building Lobby)  A uniformed doorman is on the phone to a tenant, while a nervous George stands beside him. DOORMAN  (into phone) There's a George Bonanza to see you.  GEORGE  Costanza. Costanza. DOORMAN  (into phone) George Costanza. GEORGE  The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.  DOORMAN  (into phone) Seinfeld friend. (he listens) (to George) He says, call him Monday.  A desperate George grabs the phone, and the doorman's hand, and pulls it down so's he can speak into it. GEORGE  (into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you! DOORMAN  Excuse me. GEORGE  It's about the show. It... No, it was...  DOORMAN  Excuse me. GEORGE  ...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.  George releases his grip on the phone, and indicates the doorman should listen to it. Keeping a wary eye on George, he does. DOORMAN  (into phone) Very good, sir.  A happier George slaps the doorman on the shoulder and heads toward Russell Dalrimple's apartment.  (Restaurant)  Morty stands, explaining his predicament to the maitre d', who speaks with an approximate French accent. MORTY  You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.  MAITRE D'  Why don't you just let him pay, and then you can pay him back? MORTY  No, no, he won't let me do that. MAITRE D'  Why don't you just put the money in his pants pocket, unsuspectingly? MORTY  He could wash them. MAITRE D'  Monsieur, we are running a reputable business.  MORTY  Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years! MAITRE D'  Aha, but you did not give them away, did you?  MORTY  You don't understand my... MAITRE D'  Ah, monsieur, I cannot get involved with you and your family, ah.  (Street Corner)  Kramer and Elaine stroll to the entrance of Dr Reston's building.  ELAINE  Now look, don't take too long. KRAMER  (looking around) Look at this building. What is this?  ELAINE  I don't know. It's a building. KRAMER  (indicating) The door's on a diagonal.  ELAINE  So what? KRAMER  (looking around) It's architecturally incorrect.  ELAINE  (frustrated) Just go.  Kramer opens the door and begins to enter. Elaine waves him goodbye,   then wonders why she's doing that and gives up.  (Russell Dalrimple's Apartment)  Russell has opened the door to an anxious George. In the background is a set dinner table, at which sits Cynthia, Russell's beautiful date. She looks haughty and bored throughout the scene. GEORGE  (sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything. RUSSELL  We were about to sit down to dinner.   George motions he's sorry, but makes no effort to leave. RUSSELL  (indicating) This is Cynthia. GEORGE  (entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal? RUSSELL  No. GEORGE  Looks like veal. RUSSELL  It's not veal. GEORGE  Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh) RUSSELL  Who gave you my address? GEORGE  No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.   Russell closes the door. GEORGE  He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I  really wanted.  Cynthia rises and slinks past George toward the living room area.  GEORGE  Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems. RUSSELL  So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?   Cynthia sits on the couch, and puts her wine glass on the coffee table. As George speaks, Russell crosses to the coffee table, picks up the glass and puts down a coaster, before sitting the glass on it. GEORGE  Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted. CYNTHIA  (bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide.  GEORGE  Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme... RUSSELL  Blossom's on Monday. GEORGE  Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter) RUSSELL  Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team. GEORGE  (worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh?  Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?   George is opening the door. RUSSELL  Alright, now look. These deals are already made.   George closes the door and turns back to Russell. GEORGE  Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...  George opens the door, and is halfway through. RUSSELL  Mister Costanza.  George re-enters again. GEORGE  Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...  George is halfway through the door again. CYNTHIA  (bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat?  RUSSELL  (to George) Alright. Eight thousand.  GEORGE  (pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.   George exits and Russell closes the door firmly. As Russell returns to Cynthia, there is a tentative tap at the door. Russell opens it, to reveal George. GEORGE  May I just use your bathroom for a moment?   (Restaurant Bathroom)  Leo and Jerry are mid-negotiation over the watch. JERRY  Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here! LEO  Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it. JERRY  Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred! LEO  (indicating) I've never seen a band like this.  JERRY  Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it! LEO  You have it on you? JERRY  Yeah, I think I do.  Jerry fetches out his wallet. JERRY  (under his breath) This is unbelievable.   Jerry begins handing over a wad of bills to Leo. The door to the bathroom opens and Morty enters. MORTY  What the hell is going on here?  (Dr Reston's Office)  On the street outside, Elaine waits, while upstairs Kramer introduces   himself to Dr Reston. KRAMER  Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.  RESTON  (shaking hands) Thank you for coming in.  KRAMER  Thank you. RESTON  Please, sit down.  Dr Reston sits in one of a pair of leather armchairs which face each other, he crosses his legs. KRAMER  (quiet) Okay.  Kramer sits and the leather of the chair makes a series of embarrassing   rumbles and squeaks, with more of the same as he emulates Dr Reston's crossed legs sitting position. RESTON  Could I offer you something to drink. Uhm, coffee? Anything?  KRAMER  Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?  RESTON  I don't think we have that. KRAMER  Well, that's a little strange. RESTON  Uh, why does that surprise you? KRAMER  Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink  RESTON  This is an office. KRAMER  That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...  RESTON  (interrupting) So tell me Mister Kramer...  KRAMER  ...Okay, yes, shoot. RESTON  Tell me all about uh, you and Elaine.  KRAMER  Oh, alrighty uh...  He moves in his seat, resulting in another digestive tract rumble from the leather. KRAMER  Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation. RESTON  Is it? KRAMER  Oh, you better believe it.  (Street Corner)  Elaine is waiting outside for Kramer. Along the street strolls Joe Davola, singing as he goes. DAVOLA  (singing) '...Travelling along...'   Elaine recognises the tune, and joins in. ELAINE/DAVOLA  '...singing a song, side by side...'   Davola stops and looks at Elaine. He looks like he likes what he sees, and Elaine seems interested too. They flirt. ELAINE  Wow. You really have a terrible voice.  DAVOLA  Do I know you? ELAINE  Uhh, I don't think so. DAVOLA  'Cos you really look familiar. ELAINE  Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount Rushmore. DAVOLA  Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale. ELAINE  Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.  DAVOLA  Oh really. ELAINE  Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.  They laugh and smile at each other.  (Dr. Reston's Office)  Kramer and Dr Reston are also laughing. KRAMER  You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right. RESTON  I'm glad we agree. KRAMER  (reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans. RESTON  I'd love one.  Kramer hands over a cigar and fetches a match from his pocket.  KRAMER  Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.  Kramer strikes a match on the sole of his shoe. RESTON  If you ever feel, a need to talk to someone...  KRAMER  (lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh.  RESTON  ...About anything. You have my number.  KRAMER  (lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.   Kramer puts down the match, not noticing he's placed it on a box of tissues. He and Dr Reston puff contentedly at their cigars.  KRAMER  Mmm, these are good, huh?  Kramer notices he's set light to the top tissue in the box.  KRAMER  (quiet) Oh.  Kramer pulls the smouldering tissue from the box. He shakes it to put out the fire, but a piece falls to the floor. As he reaches for it, he keeps the rest of the tissue in his hand, where it burns his fingers. He jumps, almost dropping his cigar, and sucks at his burned digits.  (Street Corner)  Elaine is using Davola's back as a rest as she jots her number on a piece of paper. ELAINE  I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you? DAVOLA  No, I don't think so.  Elaine hands the piece of paper and the pen back to Davola as they laugh at the ludicrous possibility that he might be a nut.  (Restaurant)  Naomi is handing her card to Jerry. JERRY  I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.  NAOMI  (joking) Really? I give out my number to just about every customer who comes in here. JERRY  Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.  NAOMI  (playing it straight) Oh yeah. Actually, I'm a little disappointed. I kind of had my eye on uncle Leo. JERRY  Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin? NAOMI  Why? JERRY  They eat fish.  Naomi starts to laugh at his joke. It is, of course, the laugh later described as 'Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer'. It's loud and persistent. Jerry leaves, but then leans back around the corner with a look of disbelief on his face.   (Lobby In Dr. Reston's Office)  A cheerful Joe Davola waits for the elevator to arrive, whistling 'Side By Side'. The elevator arrives with a ding of the bell. The door opens and Kramer steps out, shielded from Davola by other passengers. Kramer walks away, relighting his cigar, as Davola enters the elevator, still whistling   happily.  (Street Corner)  Elaine sits on the steps outside the building. The door opens and one of the other elevator passengers exits, he releases the door, which swings shut, almost striking Kramer. Kramer walks toward Elaine. KRAMER  Hey. ELAINE  What happened? What took you so long?  KRAMER  Hey, he's a terrific guy. ELAINE  Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?  KRAMER  Well, we talked about a lot of things.   The camera pans up, toward the lighted window of Dr Reston's office.  ELAINE  You talked about a lot of things? Well...  KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Did you talk about us?  Elaine and Kramer's voices fade out, and the voices inside the window fade up. DAVOLA  I'm in love. I just met her outside in the street. Her name's Elaine. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.  RESTON  Did you say Elaine?  (Nightclub)  Jerry's standup piece. JERRY  How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, \"Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!\"   (Jerry's Apartment)  Jerry brings his parents' cases from the bedroom. Helen is finishing   packing. MORTY  You shoulda told me it didn't work.  JERRY  I know, I know. HELEN  You didn't have to throw it out. JERRY  I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.  The buzzer sounds. HELEN  Oh, that must be Leo. JERRY  I woulda taken you to the airport.  HELEN  He has nothing to do. JERRY  Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah? GEORGE  It's George. JERRY  Come on up. (to parents) It's George.  MORTY  Oh, it's George. HELEN  What ever happened with NBC and the deal?  JERRY  Ah, George turned it down. HELEN  He turned it down? JERRY  Yeah. HELEN  Why did he do that? JERRY  Because of Ted Danson. HELEN  What does Ted Danson have to do with it?  MORTY  Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson. JERRY  (fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.  George enters. GEORGE  (to Jerry) Hey. MORTY  Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya? GEORGE  Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?  He approaches Helen for a greeting. HELEN  What's the matter with you? GEORGE  What'd I do? JERRY  What about NBC? Did you hear anything?  GEORGE  Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.  Jerry looks expectantly, but George makes him wait. GEORGE  We got a deal.  There is an outpouring of jubilation and congratulations aimed at George. MORTY/HELEN/JERRY  (simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!  JERRY  Heyy! Terrific. MORTY  You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder) GEORGE  Uh, please, Morty. MORTY  No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again) GEORGE  I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...  JERRY  Aww... GEORGE  ...Who's not doing this for the money.  JERRY  ...C'mon. GEORGE  You have no idea how refreshing that is.  JERRY  So what'd we get? GEORGE  (big smile) Eight thousand dollars.  JERRY  Beautiful! GEORGE  (quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.  HELEN  Four thousand apiece? JERRY  Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out for... less money. GEORGE  I was wrong, you were right. JERRY  You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up. GEORGE  You're smart, I'm dumb. JERRY  You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.   The buzzer sounds. HELEN  That's gotta be Leo. JERRY  (to intercom) Yeah? LEO  Leo. JERRY  Alright, we're coming down. MORTY  Alright, let's get going. JERRY  Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.   Jerry fetches a small package from the kitchen drawer and offers it to Morty. JERRY  A present. MORTY  A present?  Morty opens it. MORTY  Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.  JERRY  C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.  HELEN  I hope you didn't spend too much on that.  MORTY  I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me. HELEN  He's something, you son, isn't he?  JERRY  Ah hah, alright, let's go.  Everyone begins to head for the door. MORTY  You're a terrific kid.  Jerry picks up a case. JERRY  Okay. GEORGE  Yeah, he's something, isn't he?  George picks up the other case, as Morty and Helen exit. HELEN  How could anybody not like you? GEORGE  (to Jerry) You're very special. JERRY  (pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.   (Street)  Uncle Leo has the trunk of his car open and looks impatient.  LEO  Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.  MORTY  Alright, Leo. JERRY  Hey, uncle Leo. LEO  Hi, hi... JERRY  How you doing?  There are murmurs of greetings. JERRY  This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.  LEO  Yeah, I hate to give it up. JERRY  Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?  MORTY  Jerry! JERRY  Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.  HELEN  (hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry. GEORGE  Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care. MORTY  Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.  GEORGE  (shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.  JERRY  Take care now. So long.  Jerry and George walk away to cross the street back to the apartment.   They speak quietly, so's Helen and Morty don't overhear. GEORGE  Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.  JERRY  Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.  GEORGE  You're kidding. JERRY  He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it. GEORGE  Man, would I like to see the look on his face.   Jerry gives a final wave to his parents. They wave back. MORTY  You believe this? HELEN  What? MORTY  (indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.  HELEN  You're kidding. MORTY  Who needs this?  He tosses the wallet into the trash bin. MORTY  Leo, let's go.  Morty and Helen climb into Leo's car. Leo closes the trunk and walks toward the driver's door. He stops, as something catches his eye. Leo picks the wallet out of the trash, looks around to see if anyone's watching, and tucks it into his pocket as he goes to get in the car.  (Comedy club)  Jerry's standup piece. JERRY  ...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, \"Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now.\" \"This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration.\" You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) \"Here's fifty-six people that know me.\" Cop goes. \"Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check.\"   THE END>",

JERRY  Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of   all time. \"I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... ha ha \" Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the   healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... extracts the pulp and the vitamins, for long life   and vitality.  (break) JERRY  How could you leave a mesage like that on my machine.?  GEORGE  Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?  JERRY  Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!

JERRY  Well, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a   girl with a laugh like that? It's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger.   Cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish mongers a pretty bad smell.  GEORGE  Well maybe you should ask Elaine. JERRY  Yeah but if I ask Elaine, Kramer will feel slighted.  GEORGE  Oh no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.  JERRY  Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?   (Kramer enters smoking a cigar) JERRY  Ah, Kramer.

MEL  So anyway, you're his favourite comedian. he laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot   of hemoglobin. JERRY  That's nice!

SUSANAOMI  So, what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?  JERRY  No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.  SUSANAOMI  Oh, GEORGE  What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?  JERRY  That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. anyway what can I do I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.   It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin. SUSANAOMI  Well, where does he live?

They got   pies and I got the directions right here.  (break)  (Kramer's car) KRAMER  So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind   if I smoke? NAOMI  No. KRAMER  These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.  NAOMI  ha ha ha ha ha ha  (The Sangers' house) GEORGE  I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.   (Susan smooches him) GEORGE  Stop, would you quit it. GEORGE  Maybe someone is going to see us here.  SUSANAOMI  So what? You are SUCH a prude. GEORGE  Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them.  SUSANAOMI  Come on lets go in. GEORGE  What? SUSANAOMI  Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.  GEORGE  I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.  SUSANAOMI  What's the matter? GEORGE  I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the   hospital. She was getting' better.  And then I went to pay her a visit. She say my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.  SUSANAOMI  We're goin' in. Come on. GEORGE  Susan, please... (grabs her) SUSANAOMI  George. Stop.

Why do you keep reminding me about the BB?   (Elaine stares at him and blows a bubble with bubble gum) JERRY  I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.  WAITRESS  How about you? ELAINE  I'll just have a glass of water. JERRY  (whispers) You can't just have water.  ELAINE  Why not? That's all I want.

But it's really just a plastic   divider. GEORGE  and SUSANAOMI: (nod)  (long pause) GEORGE  Can you uh, go in the bubble? MRS. SANGER  Well, you have to put so many things on because of the germs.  MEL  The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production.  GEORGE  So then he makes his own bed? MRS. SANGER  well, that's one of the things we fight about.  MEL  Would you like to meet him? GEORGE  Uh, well, you know,... MRS. SANGER  He loves games. Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit with him.  DONALD  HEY MA WHAT THE HELL DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND HERE? I'M STARVIN'.

You're choking me. Elaine!  WAITRESS  Are you going to pay for that? JERRY  No, I want the picture back.  (angry guy enters) MAN #1  Something's happened to the BB. They're rushing him to the hospital.  WAITRESS  What? (releases Jerry) JERRY  The BB? He lives around here? MAN #1  That's his house right down the road.  MAN #2  He got in a fight with some guy. GUY1  What kind of person would hurt the BB?  MAN #2  Some little bald guy from the city.  MAN #1  Vern, Page, Preston, don't you think we ought to do somethin'?

GEORGE  No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.  JERRY  \"We're\"? What do you mean, \"We're\"?  GEORGE  Susan wants me to be there. JERRY  You're meetin' the father for the first time?  GEORGE  (Reluctantly) Yeah. JERRY  (Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.  GEORGE  I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!  JERRY  (Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..  GEORGE  Yeah, I know what happened. JERRY  No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..  GEORGE  (Getting frustrated) I know. JERRY  (Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..  GEORGE  Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.  JERRY  (Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.  GEORGE  (Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn   a cabin down.. JERRY  (Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.  GEORGE  We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.  JERRY  (Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.  GEORGE  (Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?  JERRY  What, you got a problem with the pen now?  GEORGE  Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.  JERRY  Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I,   Scene A. GEORGE  (Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?  JERRY  (Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.  GEORGE  (Offering) Drink? JERRY  No, no thank you. GEORGE  (Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.  JERRY  Act I, Scene A..  (A long pause as they both attempt to start writing passes)  GEORGE  Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?  JERRY  (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh,   yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay   phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to   Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not   even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So   we're on for later?  (Scene cuts to Elaine's office. She's waving a pencil around in her free hand)  ELAINE  Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up)   Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?  (Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)  GEORGE  Alright, here we go. You got it? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Here we go. JERRY  Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.  GEORGE  (Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?   (A long pause, then the scene jumps back to Elaine and Sandra)  ELAINE  Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?  SANDRA  Why? Did Jerry say something? ELAINE  No, no. SANDRA  He must have said something. ELAINE  Oh, no, he didn't say anything. SANDRA  (Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly)  ELAINE  (Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a   stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!  (Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George are sleeping. Kramer slams his apartment door shut, waking both of them up)  GEORGE  Alright, let's go. JERRY  Here we go.  (Both get situated to write as Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey. GEORGE  yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..  JERRY  Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?  KRAMER  (Complaining) No more golf. JERRY  Why? KRAMER  Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple   of those Cuban cigars? JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  (Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for   more, huh? GEORGE  What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!  KRAMER  Why? What's one thing got to do with another?  GEORGE  Kramer, please. KRAMER  Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it,   they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!  GEORGE  Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.  KRAMER  (Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)  GEORGE  (Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.  JERRY  What?! GEORGE  Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.  JERRY  (Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?  GEORGE  I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)   (Scene ends)  (The Ross' house)  (Susan, her parents, and George are all dining) MRS. ROSS  (To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?  MR. ROSS  (Gruff) A slight resemblance.  (George laughs slightly) MRS. ROSS  (To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.  GEORGE  Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..   (Seeing the Ross' expression, he trails off) MR. ROSS  How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?  GEORGE  Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.  MR. ROSS  You know those cigars are made special for Castro?  GEORGE  (Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)  MR. ROSS  What? SUSAN  (Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.  MR. ROSS  I didn't care much for his jokes. SUSAN  (To George) Daddy never laughs. GEORGE  Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going \"Ha, ha!\"? What is that? \"Ha, ha!\"?  MR. ROSS  You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.  MRS. ROSS  You and your cigars.. MR. ROSS  (Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.  SUSAN  Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..  MR. ROSS  Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?  GEORGE  (Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and Elaine are talking. Jerry's using a harsh tone) JERRY  Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this   woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable! ELAINE  (Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?  JERRY  (Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?  ELAINE  (Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.  JERRY  (Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her   hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her   and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) \"Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on   the phone.\" (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering)   Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out \"Just go\" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um..   yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.   (Scene ends)  (The Ross' house)  (Same diner party is going on. News of the cabin has yet to be discussed)  GEORGE  The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?  SUSAN  Uhh.. about the cabin.. MR. ROSS  (Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would   be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs.   Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) \"Cherish the cabin.\" Not, uh, \"Take care   of your sister.\" (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, \"Cherish the cabin.\" (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.  GEORGE  (Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.  MR. ROSS  What? GEORGE  S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..  MR. ROSS  When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)  MRS. ROSS  (Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.  SUSAN  Daddy.. MR. ROSS  Yes? SUSAN  Daddy, about the cabin.. MRS. ROSS  (Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)  MR. ROSS  (To Susan) What about it? SUSAN  Well, the thing is.. MR. ROSS  What? What is it? SUSAN  Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?  GEORGE  (Extremely blunt) Burned. MR. ROSS  Burned? SUSAN  There was a fire, and it uh.. GEORGE  Burned. MR. ROSS  (Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?  GEORGE  (Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo.. MRS. ROSS  (Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)  MR. ROSS  Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?  SUSAN  (Solemn) No. Nothing. MRS. ROSS  (Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.   (Mr. Ross, devastated, slowly gets up and starts walking toward the room's exit as everyone continues to talk)  GEORGE  Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even   say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out   to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Sandra runs out of Jerry's room, hastily putting on her jacket. Jerry follow, buttoning his shirt)  SANDRA  (Offended) I can't believe you said that!  JERRY  What?! SANDRA  (Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!  JERRY  What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!  SANDRA  That was a weird thing to say. JERRY  Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.  SANDRA  Ohh, I think you're really sick. JERRY  (Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.  SANDRA  I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)  JERRY  I really think you're making too much of this.  SANDRA  (Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door)  JERRY  Let me walk you to a cab. SANDRA  (Opens the door) That's ok. JERRY  I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.  SANDRA  Oh, really? (Quickly walks out) JERRY  (Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.   (Scene ends)  (The Coffee shop)  (Jerry's telling George about last night) JERRY  So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.  GEORGE  Wo-hoah! What did you do? JERRY  (Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?  GEORGE  Yeah, right. JERRY  I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the   hand, and I'm thinking, \"That hand should not be on my leg.\" But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, \"Would you mind?!\"  GEORGE  Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?  JERRY  I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..  GEORGE  Alright, so, go ahead. JERRY  So we go back to my apartment.. GEORGE  (Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!  JERRY  So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts   with the dirty talking. GEORGE  (Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?  JERRY  (Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..  GEORGE  No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?  JERRY  Typical things. GEORGE  (Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.  JERRY  She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out   and files off-screen. George reacts deeply) GEORGE  (Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.  JERRY  ..And then she starts talking about her panties.  GEORGE  (Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!  JERRY  So I said something. GEORGE  Ok, what did you say? JERRY  (Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.  GEORGE  Of course. JERRY  Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, \"You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?\"  GEORGE  (Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) \"The panties your mother laid out for you\"? (Jerry nods) What   does that mean? JERRY  (Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.  GEORGE  Well, how did she react? JERRY  She flipped out! Just left. GEORGE  Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.  JERRY  Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me   hear the end of it.  GEORGE; Well, what if this girl says something? JERRY  She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check)   Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh? GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.  JERRY  I guess he failed to see the humor in it.  GEORGE  Huh. (Makes a \"over his head\" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.  JERRY  (Getting up) Alright, big work day.  GEORGE  That's right.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and George, with their writing materials, go to sit down in the living room while giving each other pep talks)  GEORGE  Okay. JERRY  Let's go. GEORGE  Here we are. JERRY  Right now. GEORGE  Let's do it. JERRY  You and me. GEORGE  Okay. JERRY  Alright. GEORGE  What'dya got? JERRY  (Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter, you go \"Hi\", and I go, \"Hello.\" Now.. we need something here..   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Oh, hey.  (Both George and Jerry get up, giving Kramer an excited greeting - talking fast, together) Oh, you guys are working? I'll come back. (Turns to leave. Jerry and   George strongly protest with a series of \"No, no, no!\"'s) No, you guys should get back to work. (More protests)  GEORGE  Don't be silly. JERRY  Come in, we're taking a break. KRAMER  (Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?  JERRY  Yeah! KRAMER  Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?  GEORGE  (Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.  KRAMER  (Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite   \"No, don't go!\" and other various comments by Jerry and George)   (Scene ends)  (United Nations' Permanent Mission of Cuba building)  (Kramer walks up to a secretary) KRAMER  Buenos dias. SECRETARY  Buenos dias. KRAMER  Uh, habla ingles? SECRETARY  Si. KRAMER  Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.  SECRETARY  What is this about? KRAMER  Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.  SECRETARY  Are you an American? KRAMER  Oh, yeah. SECRETARY  I see.. excuse me. (Picks up the phone)  KRAMER  Okay.  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry, curled up on his living room chair, and George, laid out on the sofa, are asleep. Jerry's buzzer goes off, waking them up. George rolls off the couch and falls   to the floor) JERRY  (Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through   intercom) Yeah? ELAINE  It's Elaine. JERRY  C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)  GEORGE  (Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..  JERRY  (Agreeing) Yeah, we should. GEORGE  Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?  JERRY  Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?  GEORGE  No, no, no, no. JERRY  Oh.  (Elaine enters) ELAINE  Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld! JERRY  What? ELAINE  I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.  JERRY  Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.  ELAINE  Why? What happened? Did you talk? JERRY  Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should   be talking to. ELAINE  Really? JERRY  Yes. ELAINE  Really? You really think I should fire her?  JERRY  Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.   (George, sitting out the couch, dozes off to sleep)  (Scene ends)  (United Nations' Permanent Mission of Cuba building)  (A group of men in suits walk out into the lobby to deal with Kramer)  MAN  (To secretary) Expira te afuera. KRAMER  (Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.  MAN  What is your name, Senor? KRAMER  Uh, Kramer. MAN  So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?  KRAMER  (Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars.  MAN  (Confused) Cigars? KRAMER  (Definite) Cigars. MAN  What about cigars? KRAMER  Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..  MAN  Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..  KRAMER  (Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?  MAN  (Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.  KRAMER  Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?  (The man is staring at Kramer's clothes, mesmerized. He reaches out to touch Kramer's legendary jacket)  MAN  I like that jacket..  (Scene ends)  (The Ross' apartment)  (There's a knock at the door. Susan answers it - it's Jerry and George)  SUSAN  Hi! GEORGE  Hi, how are ya? (They kiss) SUSAN  Hey, Jerry. JERRY  Hi. SUSAN  I thought you two guys were working today.  JERRY  Ah, just - takin' a little break. GEORGE  (Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)  SUSAN  Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother,   Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend. GEORGE  Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?  RICKY  (Blunt) I don't have one. GEORGE  Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)  SUSAN  (Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.  SARA  (Staring at George) He doesn't look like me.  MRS. ROSS  Sara, what do you have on your wheels?  SARA  Nothing, they're clean. MRS. ROSS  Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?  RICKY  (Annoyed) Yes. MRS. ROSS  (Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you   wipe your wheels.  (Doorbell rings) SUSAN  Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.  RAYMOND  Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire.  SUSAN  (Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box)   Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here. GEORGE  Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)  SUSAN  From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.  JERRY AND GEORGE  Oh, wow. SUSAN  (Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) \"Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's   attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love   you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin.\" (George nods, and Jerry gives a \"Oh, of course\" reaction)   (A long pause) GEORGE  Well, we.. we, we, ah.. JERRY  (Looking at his watch ) Yeah.. GEORGE  We really should be, uh, heading out..  JERRY  Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.  GEORGE  You know, the time..  (Susan's father is now standing in the hallway) MR. ROSS  The box! (Rushes toward George, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from Susan's hands) My letters! Gimme that! (Now holding them   against his chest, defensively) Who told you to open this?!  MRS. ROSS  (Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!  SARA  (Yelling out) I knew it! MRS. ROSS  I want to know who John is! RICKEY  John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!  MR. ROSS  (Proclaiming) Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly   walks back to his room, leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go)  GEORGE  Well, we really should be- JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.  JERRY  Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.  GEORGE  yeah, time is what he's indicating there..  JERRY  (Waving good bye) We'll see ya. GEORGE  Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.   (Jerry grabs George, leaving)  (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and George, once again, are sitting down in the living room, attempting to write)  GEORGE  Alright, here we go. JERRY  Alright, let's go. GEORGE  Come on now. JERRY  Right now. GEORGE  Here we go. JERRY  You and me. GEORGE  You got it. JERRY  No foolin' GEORGE  Ok, so, what'dya got? JERRY  (Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say \"Hi\", and I say \"Hello\".  GEORGE  Alright, so, we need something.. JERRY  Yeah.. how about this: I say \"How's it goin'?\"  GEORGE  \"How's it going?\" - beautiful.  (They both start to write it down as a pounding on the door sounds) Oh, come on, we were just on a roll now..  JERRY  (Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?  GEORGE  (Nodding, writing) \"How's it going?\"  JERRY  Did you write it down? GEORGE  I'm writin' it. \"How's it going?\" JERRY  Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)  ELAINE  Real good! JERRY  What?! ELAINE  Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!  JERRY  What?! How? ELAINE  I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!  JERRY  What calls?! ELAINE  Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!  JERRY  Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?  ELAINE  (Confused) \"Anything else\"? What do you mean \"anything else\"?  JERRY  So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?  ELAINE  Yeah! JERRY  (Smiling to himself) Beautiful. ELAINE  Why is that beautiful? JERRY  Oh, no, not beautiful. ELAINE  It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!  JERRY  Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.  ELAINE  No, no. JERRY  (Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-  ELAINE  (Giving up too easy) Okay. JERRY  (Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?   (Elaine opens the door to find Kramer and the 3 Cubans dressed up in golf wear, smoking cigars)  KRAMER  Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.  JERRY  Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.  KRAMER  Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.  JERRY  Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..  KRAMER  (Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!   (They exit) ELAINE  (Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?  GEORGE  Oh, uh, \"The Falconer\" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.  ELAINE  (To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?  JERRY  Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta   get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here. ELAINE  (Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.  JERRY  (Moving back into the living room) Okay.  ELAINE  (In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid   out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places) THE END>",

        "text": "  THE OPERA Written by   Larry Charles   (Comedy club)  The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all the same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is like the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. The tuxedo is a wedding safety device created by women because they know that men are undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes one step over and she marries the next guy. That's why the wedding vow isn't 'do you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.  INSIDE JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT JERRY  (answering machine) leave a message and I'll call you back, thanks.

JERRY  and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.  JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT  The door is open. Elaine knocks and then enters. ELAINE  Joey? Joey?  She sees a wall covered in photos of her.  Joe Divola enters and shuts the front door. ELAINE  Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!  JOE DIVOLA  Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.  ELAINE  You left your door open. JOE DIVOLA  I know, I like to encourage intruders.  ELAINE  (laughs) What's all this? JOE DIVOLA  Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.  ELAINE  Where did you get all these pictures?  JOE DIVOLA  I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering. ELAINE  Showering? JOE DIVOLA  I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?  ELAINE  In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right? JOE DIVOLA  Why ELAINE  Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?  JOE DIVOLA  Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?  ELAINE  That's a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well. JOE DIVOLA  What are you doing here? ELAINE  Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.  JOE DIVOLA  Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it. ELAINE  Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.  JOE DIVOLA  Really? ELAINE  Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I'm just gonna get the uh..  Divola is blocking the door with his head. JOE DIVOLA  You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?  ELAINE  Uh.. I'm Elaine! JOE DIVOLA  He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.  ELAINE  Oh. JOE DIVOLA  Do you think I'm a clown, Nedda? ELAINE  Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it's bad to be a clown, if it's bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.  JOE DIVOLA  You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.  ELAINE  Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I'm gonna... get out of here.  Divola blocks the door when Elaine tries to leave. JOE DIVOLA  Pagliacci kills his wife. ELAINE  Se, now that's terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don't know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown JOE DIVOLA  You're not leaving  Elaine sprays Divola in the eyes and he falls on his back. Elaine leaves.   JERRY'S APARTMENT. JERRY  (on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that's not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what's the difference, I'm a comedian of the United States, and I'll tell you I'm under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.  Knock at door. JERRY  (cautiously) Who is it? GEORGE  It's George.  George enters wearing a very small tuxedo. GEORGE  What, are you locking the door now?  JERRY  Well, well, look at you. It's a little skimpy there isn't it?  GEORGE  Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding. JERRY  Ooo, that was a bad toast. GEORGE  It wasn't that bad. JERRY  I never heard anybody curse in a toast.  GEORGE  I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.  JERRY  There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts. GEORGE  Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know. JERRY  What do you mean not going? why not?  GEORGE  I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket. JERRY  Why doesn't she pay for hers? GEORGE  That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That's all I'm asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for? JERRY  It's nice to get a reach.  Loud thump is heard from the front door. JERRY  Who is it? KRAMER  It's me!  Kramer is on the floor KRAMER  What, are you locking the door now?  JERRY  Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?  KRAMER  I am dressed. JERRY  You're going like this? KRAMER  Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.  JERRY  I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!  KRAMER  People do, I don't. JERRY  Well what about me! If you're going like that, I'm not going like this. GEORGE  Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I'm comfortable here. I can't change, I've got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can't go like this alone! JERRY  Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours? GEORGE  That's not the issue, we're friends, if I've got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too! JERRY  All right, all right, I'll wear this. It's bad enough I've got to go to the opera I've got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.   Kramer is playing opera music JERRY  Would you turn that down! What is that crap!  KRAMER  It's Pagliacci! JERRY  Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets. KRAMER  Why? What happened? JERRY  Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either. KRAMER  That's fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket. GEORGE  What? Really? KRAMER  Yeah. GEORGE  People are looking for tickets here?  KRAMER  What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up! GEORGE  Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.  JERRY  Oh yeah right. KRAMER  OK come on, let's go get the tickets.  GEORGE  All right, all right. JERRY  All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre. GEORGE  Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal? KRAMER  Oh yeah!  Kramer and George leave.  INSIDE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT  Opera music is playing, Joe Divola is putting on white clown make up.   END OF ACT 1  OUTSIDE THE THEATRE.  Jerry and Elaine are waiting. JERRY  You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?  ELAINE  Cherry Binaca, it's new. JERRY  See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular! ELAINE  It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.

JERRY  Do you remember the curse toast? ELAINE  Oh yeah, the curse toast. JERRY  So, can you believe that message? Now I've got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. ELAINE  Me too JERRY  Crazy Joe Divola ELAINE  How do you know his name? JERRY  What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?  ELAINE  I never told you his name. JERRY  I never told you his name. ELAINE  Wait a second, who are we talking about here?  JERRY  Joe Divola. ELAINE  Right, Joe Divola JERRY  How do you know his name? ELAINE  I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.   They click JERRY  Oh my god, its Joe Divola ELAINE  Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?  JERRY  That madman is trying to kill me. ELAINE  Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!! JERRY  Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I'm the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me! ELAINE  Oooohh, what about me!  Divola walks up to them, dressed in the clown suit. JOE DIVOLA  Excuse me ELAINE&amp;JERRY  Aaahhhhh!!  ALLEYWAY  George still hasn't sold the ticket. GEORGE  But this is Pavarotti! MAN#3  Three hundred dollars, that's a lot of money.   Mr &amp; Mrs Reichman are walking through the alley MR REICHMAN  You know Steven Holstman (?) did a production at Tunis last yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it.  GEORGE  All right, I'll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let's stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I've got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here. MR REICHMAN  Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse me.  GEORGE  Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.  MR REICHMAN  Costanza!? GEORGE  Mr Reichman? MR REICHMAN  You've still got a mouth like a surd give me those tickets.  MRS REICHMAN  Harold, no, Harold, Harold be careful of you're hair transplant!  OUTSIDE THE THEATRE JOE DIVOLA  Anything is welcome, I accept change.  JERRY  I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.  JOE DIVOLA  You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person. JERRY  I'm telling you, the guy took.....  JOE DIVOLA  And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.   Mrs Reichman runs past MRS REICHMAN  Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere!  JOE DIVOLA  What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?  ELAINE  I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out. JOE DIVOLA  You people make me sick. JERRY  That is one angry clown!  COMEDY CLUB JERRY  The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. \"Who was that clown?\", \"I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?\", \"The guy's a clown!\". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, \"What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!\"   END OF ACT 2 JERRY  (Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!  ELAINE  You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons. JERRY  Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I'm serious, I'm not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.  JOE DIVOLA  I don't want any money. ELAINE  I smell cherry. JOE DIVOLA  It's Binaca. JERRY  Binaca?  They see the real clown singing and realize that they are talking to Crazy Joe. They run away.  ALLEYWAY  George is finalizing the deal. GEORGE  What did we say? Two seventy-five?  MAN#3  Two fifty. GEORGE  Two fifty? Are you sure MAN#3  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. GEORGE  All right, all right, two fifty. SUSAN  George! GEORGE  S-Susan SUSAN  I can't believe it, I'm so glad I caught you.  GEORGE  What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.  SUSAN  Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia. GEORGE  So what, they don't have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?  SUSAN  She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!  GEORGE  Yeah you made it, how about that. SUSAN  Oh, I'm so excited, now we get to see the opera together.   George gives the man the ticket and takes the money. GEORGE  We get to go to the opera together!  SUSAN  Who's that? GEORGE  That's-that's-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.   ENTRANCE TO THEATER. JERRY  Come on, you gotta let us in USHER  Not without tickets. JERRY  We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.  USHER  Well that's a problem. Excuse me. JERRY  You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us. USHER  A crazy clown is after you? Oh that's rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through.  Kramer slides in. JERRY&amp;ELAINE  We're with him, we're with him. KRAMER  Are you guys ready? JERRY&amp;ELAINE  Yeah, Yeah!! KRAMER  Have you seen George? JERRY  We thought he was with you. ELAINE  Come on, he's on his own, come on!   SITTING IN THE THEATER KRAMER  These are great seats huh? ELAINE  Yeah KRAMER  Yeah JERRY  Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.  ELAINE  Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?  JERRY  She's playing, Pagliacci's wife, Nedda.  ELAINE  Nedda? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Oh my god..  Man #3 enters and shuffles to his seat. MAN#3  Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.  Susan comes in from the other side. JERRY  Susan! What are you doing here? SUSAN  My Friend's flight couldn't make it.  JERRY  Where's George? MAN#3  I got his ticket. SUSAN  He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.  JERRY  Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket? MAN#3  One seventy-five. JERRY  Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?  KRAMER  Some nut in a clown suit!  The show starts, everyone claps except Elaine and Jerry who look very frightened.  (Comedy club) JERRY  I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty,  three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that's more you're thing. THE END>",

        "text": "  THE VIRGIN Written by   Peter Mehlman   (Jerry and George talking near a bar.) JERRY  We're dead. GEORGE  We're not dead. JERRY  We are dead. GEORGE  Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.  JERRY  All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.  GEORGE  So we'll do it tomorrow. JERRY  Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?  GEORGE  About six years ago. JERRY  I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.  GEORGE  Women like skiers. JERRY  So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.  GEORGE  Yeah. Right. JERRY  Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.  GEORGE  The closet business? What's the closet business?  JERRY  What is it your business? GEORGE  I'm interested. JERRY  She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.  GEORGE  So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Yeah. So what happened? JERRY  So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.  MARLA  (Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.  JERRY  George, Marla. GEORGE  Marla. MARLA  George. Jerry, Stacey. JERRY  Stacey. STACEY  Jerry. JERRY  George, Stacey. GEORGE  Stacey. STACEY  George. JERRY  George. GEORGE  Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)  MARLA  So, how was your trip to Berlin? JERRY  Trip to Berlin? MARLA  Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.  JERRY  Oh, right, right. MARLA  The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.  JERRY  Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, \"Why knock my brains out?\"  MARLA  You, know my boyfriend went. JERRY  Really? MARLA  Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.  JERRY  Oh, did he like it? MARLA  I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)  GEORGE  Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.  STACEY  Wow, what a great job. A writer. GEORGE  Not a bad way to make a buck. STACEY  Sounds great. GEORGE  Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)  JERRY  So, are you gonna go out with her?  GEORGE  I might. JERRY  What about Susan? GEORGE  What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?  JERRY  Depends. GEORGE  Depends on what? JERRY  On many factors. GEORGE  Like what? JERRY  Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?  GEORGE  No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.  JERRY  What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?  GEORGE  Implied. JERRY  She got anything in your medicine cabinet?  GEORGE  There might be some moisturizer. JERRY  Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?  GEORGE  (Pause) Yeah. JERRY  Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.  GEORGE  What? JERRY  You got yourself a girlfriend. GEORGE  Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?  JERRY  I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...  GEORGE  Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, \"What do you do?\" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.  JERRY  You're going to make a good father someday.  GEORGE  Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.  JERRY  Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?  GEORGE  No, what? JERRY  The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.  GEORGE  Why? What do you mean? JERRY  Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?  GEORGE  Oh, right. Oh no, man. JERRY  you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.  JERRY  (sarcastically) Oh, yeah. GEORGE  Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.  JERRY  This is your plan? GEORGE  No, no. I'm just thinking. JERRY  I don't think you are. MARLA  Let me tell you what I think. JERRY  Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.  MARLA  Are you very fussy about your pants?  JERRY  I don't think I am. MARLA  Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?  JERRY  Try me. MARLA  Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.  JERRY  Everything? MARLA  Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.  JERRY  You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?  KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  What are you doing? KRAMER  I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.  JERRY  No. KRAMER  What? JERRY  This is not a good time. KRAMER  Five minutes. What? JERRY  What did you have to give your TV away to George for?  KRAMER  Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.  JERRY  Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)  KRAMER  Well, wow. JERRY  Marla, Kramer. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Why don't you go out? It's nice out.  KRAMER  Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.  JERRY  There's weather. KRAMER  Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.  JERRY  I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.  KRAMER  No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?  JERRY  I don't know. KRAMER  Will you tape it? JERRY  Kramer... (points to Marla) KRAMER  Yeah. (He exits) JERRY  So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.  MARLA  Never came back. JERRY  Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.  MARLA  It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.  JERRY  Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?  ELAINE  It's me. JERRY  Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?  ELAINE  I didn't get it. JERRY  Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.  MARLA  Well, he wanted me to move in with him.  JERRY  Snapple? MARLA  No thanks. JERRY  Go on. MARLA  Well I wouldn't move in because...  JERRY  Yes. MARLA  Well because... JERRY  Yeah. MARLA  Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)  ELAINE  Hello! JERRY  Hi, um. Marla, Elaine. ELAINE  I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.  JERRY  Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.  ELAINE  I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.  MARLA  I should be going. ELAINE  No, no, I'm leaving. JERRY  I like that thing in your hair there.  ELAINE  Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?  MARLA  No thanks. ELAINE  I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.  MARLA  I should be going. JERRY  So we'll talk about the hooks then?  MARLA  Yes. (She exits) ELAINE  What? Was it something I said? JERRY  She's a virgin, she just told me. ELAINE  Well I didn't know. JERRY  Well it's not like spotting a toupee.  ELAINE  Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?  JERRY  No, no, I mean... ELAINE  'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)  JERRY  Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah? GEORGE  It's George. GEORGE  She's a virgin? JERRY  A virgin. GEORGE  Wow. So what're you gonna do? JERRY  I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.  GEORGE  I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.  JERRY  You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.  GEORGE  You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.  JERRY  Yeah, me too. GEORGE  We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?  JERRY  All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.  KRAMER  I'm in. Let's go for it. GEORGE  What do you want? KRAMER  I don't care, whatever. GEORGE  I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.  KRAMER  Okay. What are you getting? GEORGE  I'm gonna get a Chow Fung. KRAMER  What's a Chow Fung? GEORGE  It's a broad noodle. KRAMER  What do you mean, a broad noodle? GEORGE  It's a big flat noodle. KRAMER  Well I don't want a big flat noodle.  GEORGE  What kind of noodle do you want? KRAMER  Who says I want a noodle? GEORGE  All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.  KRAMER  All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.  GEORGE  Fine. KRAMER  Get extra MSG. ELAINE  Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.  MARLA  So they just leave? ELAINE  Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.  MARLA  Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.  ELAINE  Eh. JERRY  All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.  GEORGE  Where's the food? What happened to Ping?  JERRY  Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.  GEORGE  Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.  JERRY  Your butler? GEORGE  Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.  JERRY  What about me? GEORGE  Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)  JERRY  (Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?  ELAINE  There was a bit of an accident. PING  Head hurts. Head really hurts. JERRY  What happened? ELAINE  Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.  GEORGE  Something happened to the food? PING  I only saved one bag. JERRY  Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?  MARLA  I'll get some ice. GEORGE  (After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)  KRAMER  Hey, you got the food? JERRY  Yeah, here. KRAMER  What took you so long? Hey, Ping! PING  Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)  KRAMER  Yeah. Where's yours? GEORGE  He dropped it. KRAMER  Oh, that's too bad. ELAINE  You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.  PING  No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.  KRAMER  (To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?  ELAINE  (To Ping) I did not jaywalk. JERRY  (To George) You're givin' him back that TV.  PING  (To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked. KRAMER  (To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.  PING  (To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.  GEORGE  (To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?  KRAMER  (To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.  JERRY  A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!  GEORGE  All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.  JERRY  What do you mean? They know we're here.  GEORGE  I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.  JERRY  No, no, would you get up? GEORGE  I can do this, Jerry. JERRY  No. GEORGE  All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.  JERRY  What? GEORGE  That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)  WOMAN  Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)  JERRY  Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)  MAN #1  Hey, Jerry. JERRY  Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.  RITA  Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson. JERRY  Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?  RITA  He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.  JERRY  Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits) RITA  Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.  MAN #2  Where's George? JERRY  Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.  SUSAN  David Letterman's on the floor? JERRY  Yeah, he just walked by. RITA  Well, I think we should get started anyway.  JERRY  Yeah, good idea. RITA  So how are you guys comin' along? JERRY  Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.  RITA  Good. (Pause) JERRY  Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?  RITA  So that's the idea? JERRY  Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.  MAN #2  Those collars are funny! MAN #1  Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing immediately. (George enters)  GEORGE  You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?  RITA  I'm Rita Kearson. GEORGE  Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.  JERRY  Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.  JERRY  So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?  GEORGE  No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.  KRAMER  You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.  JERRY  Would you give him the TV back? KRAMER  Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.  GEORGE  I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)  KRAMER  (To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!  SUSAN  Hello? GEORGE  Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?  SUSAN  What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!  GEORGE  Fired? Why? SUSAN  Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.  KRAMER  (To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.  GEORGE  But I had no... I didn't realize. SUSAN  You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!  GEORGE  I just feel terrible This is just terrible.  KRAMER  (To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.  SUSAN  I'll speak to you later. GEORGE  (Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!  JERRY  Why did he fire her? GEORGE  Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!  KRAMER  What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!  JERRY  You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.  GEORGE  What? JERRY  You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.  GEORGE  Another job? JERRY  Couple of interviews. GEORGE  Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.  MARLA  Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.  JERRY  What? Leave? Where? Why? MARLA  You know, the apartment. JERRY  Why would I leave? This is my apartment.  MARLA  Well what if it was my apartment? JERRY  Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?  MARLA  Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.  JERRY  Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.  MARLA  Maybe I should get going. JERRY  What else did you say to her? ELAINE  Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.  JERRY  More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.  ELAINE  Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.  JERRY  What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?  ELAINE  You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.  JERRY  I was trying to be. ELAINE  Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?  JERRY  Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.  ELAINE  Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.  GEORGE  What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.  WOMAN  A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.  CAROL  A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)  WOMAN  A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me! THE END>",

        "text": "  THE CONTEST Written by   Larry David   (Monk's Coffee shop)  (Jerry and Kramer are sitting opposite Elaine at a booth, eating lunch)  JERRY  (To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.  ELAINE  Mm-hm. JERRY  You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-  ELAINE  (Smiling, chewing) Who, me? JERRY  You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing   the laundry? ELAINE  (Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.  KRAMER  (Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!   (Jerry and Elaine both laugh at Kramer's impression as George slowly enters. He's in a melancholy state)  KRAMER  Hey, Georgie. JERRY AND ELAINE  Hi.  (George sits down next to Elaine - opposite Kramer) JERRY  (To George) What's the matter? GEORGE  (Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.  JERRY  \"Caught\" you? Doing what? GEORGE  You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..  ELAINE  (Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!  GEORGE  (Nods) Uh-huh. KRAMER  (Laughing) She caught you?  (Elaine laughs with Kramer) JERRY  Where? GEORGE  (Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed   to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..  JERRY  \"Glamour\"?  (Kramer and Elaine laugh slightly) GEORGE  ..So, one thing lead to another.. JERRY  So, what did she do? GEORGE  First she screams, \"George, what are you doing?! My God!\" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.  KRMAER  (Reflecting on the story so far) Man..  GEORGE  I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.  JERRY  What did you do? GEORGE  I zipped up! ELAINE  (Wide-eyed) So, she fell? GEORGE  Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!  ELAINE  No, I guess you couldn't have.. JERRY  (In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.  ELAINE  (Finishing it off) ..done that. GEORGE  So, she fell, and then she started screaming, \"My back! My back!\" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.  ELAINE  (Between chuckles) How is she? GEORGE  (Somewhat angered) She's in traction.  ELAINE  (Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry. GEORGE  It's not funny, Elaine. ELAINE  (Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.  GEORGE  Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, \"Why, George, why?!\".. I said, \"Because it's   there!\"  (Kramer laughs, sipping his drink) JERRY  \"Glamour\"?  (Elaine laughs) GEORGE  (Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.  ELAINE  What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?  GEORGE  (Definite) All together.  (The next three lines are said at the exact same time) ELAINE  Oh, gimme a break.. JERRY  (Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right. KRAMER  Oh, like you're gonna stop? JERRY AND ELAINE  C'mon.. GEORGE  You don't think I can? JERRY  No chance. GEORGE  (Daring) You think you could? JERRY  Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.  GEORGE  Care to make it interesting? JERRY  Sure, how much? GEORGE  A hundred dollars. JERRY  (Pointing) You're on. KRAMER  (Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)  JERRY  You? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  You'll be out before we get the check.  ELAINE  (Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.  GEORGE AND JERRY  (Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no.. ELAINE  Why? JERRY  (Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..  ELAINE  What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?  JERRY  Because you're a woman! ELAINE  So what? JERRY  It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.  ELAINE  (Sarcastic) Oh. JERRY  We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.  ELAINE  Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.  KRAMER  (Making a point) Not everyday. GEORGE  Alright, look, you want to be in? ELAINE  Yeah! GEORGE  You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.  KRAMER  No, a thousand! ELAINE  No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty. GEORGE  Alright, you're in for one-fifty. JERRY  (Nodding) Okay, one-fifty. GEORGE  Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?  JERRY  Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.  KRAMER  Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)   (Jerry, Elaine, and George all hook their pinkies onto his, in a 'pinkie promise', they all pull their hand away, yelling out \"Yeah!\")   (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's sitting on the couch, eating cereal while George is on the phone with his mother)  GEORGE  (Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course   I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?!   Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)  JERRY  (Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?  GEORGE  (Defensively) Whatever.  (Intercom buzzes, Jerry gets up to answer it) JERRY  How is she? GEORGE  (Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.  JERRY  (Answering to the intercom) Yeah? ELAINE  It's me. JERRY  Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)  GEORGE  Hey, what are you doing tonight? JERRY  (Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.  GEORGE  Oh, the virgin? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?  JERRY  Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.   (Kramer enters, heading for Jerry's window) KRAMER  Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.   (George and Jerry quickly join him at the window) JERRY  Where? KRAMER  Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?  GEORGE  (In awe) Wow! JERRY  (Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!   (All eyes are glued to the woman) GEORGE  (Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..  KRAMER  ..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)  JERRY  Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?  GEORGE  I would imagine it's all naked. JERRY  What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?  GEORGE  (Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.   (Elaine enters) ELAINE  Hey. JERRY AND GEORGE  (Only turning back for a second) Hey.  ELAINE  Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?  JERRY  (Over his shoulder) Not me. GEORGE  (Also, over his shoulder) Not me. ELAINE  What're you looking at? JERRY  There's a naked woman across the street.  ELAINE  (Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics   class. I'm gonna go tonight. JERRY  (Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.  ELAINE  (Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin'   to Mars. JERRY  (Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.  GEORGE  Have a good time.  (Kramer casually enters, takes a few step toward the kitchen, and slaps a wad of bills onto the counter)  KRAMER  (Declaring) I'm out!  (Kramer now has the attention of everyone in the room. Jerry's mouth is open in shock. A moment passes)  ELAINE  What?! KRAMER  Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.  GEORGE  You're out?! KRAMER  Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?  ELAINE  Well, that was fast! JERRY  Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door   behind him)  (Jerry, Elaine, and George all look at each other, reflecting)  ELAINE  ..And then there were three.  (Hospital room)  (Estelle is on a hospital bed. George, sitting back in a chair, is visiting her)  ELAINE  I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find   my son treating his body like it was an amusement park! GEORGE  (Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.  ESTELLE  Don't give me \"Ma\". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.  GEORGE  Ma, people can hear you. ESTELLE  (Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of   people could watch you! You could be a big star! GEORGE  (Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!  ESTELLE  I want you to go see a psychiatrist.  GEORGE  No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!  ESTELLE  Why? Why not?! Why won't you go? GEORGE  (Like a kid) Because I don't want to.  ESTELLE  I want you to go see somebody. GEORGE  Well, I am not going. ESTELLE  It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.   (George's cousin, Shelly, enters) SHELLY  Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?  GEORGE  (Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!   (On the other side of a curtain divider, the silhouette of a shapely nurse can be seen entering)  NURSE  Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath.   (The shadow of a patient awakening can be seen) DENISE  Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.   (The two women go about preparing the sponge bath. George is visibly affected - breathing heavily, and staring at them through the curtain)  SHELLY  (Seems not to notice what's going on beyond the divider) So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing?  GEORGE  (Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.   (The patient, Denise, is trying to get her gown off) NURSE  Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head..  DENISE  Oh.. thank you. SHELLY  (Nodding) Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on, George is now completely mesmerized)   What is it you're doing, exactly?  (A moment passes. George seems not to have heard his cousin)  ESTELLE  George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!   (New York Health Club)  (Elaine, dressed for a work-out, is signing forms while talking with her friend, Joyce)  JOYCE  So, when was the last time you took a class?  ELAINE  Oh, it's been a while. JOYCE  (Overly excited) Are you psyched? ELAINE  (Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.  JOYCE  Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here.  ELAINE  Why is that? JOYCE  (Pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?   (Elaine looks over, and her jaw drops to the floor. Breathless, she turns back to her friend)  ELAINE  (Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!  JOYCE  He's gonna be in your class today.  ELAINE  (Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!  JOYCE  I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.  ELAINE  Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.   (Jerry's car)  (Stationary, Jerry's girlfriend, Marla, and him are making out. After some deep kissing, Marla breaks away)  MARLA  Let's slow it down a little. JERRY  \"Slow it down\"? MARLA  Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..  JERRY  Ah, yeah.. I know. MARLA  You're okay with that, right? JERRY  Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't   care about that. MARLA  So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?  JERRY  (Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.  MARLA  Alright, then. Good night. JERRY  Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)   (Jerry's bedroom)  (Jerry, in the middle of the night, is moving around - unable to get to sleep, he's restless. Scene cuts to George. He's wide awake, and staring at the ceiling. Cut to   Elaine. She's settling into bed, unable to get to sleep. The scene takes a final cut to Kramer. He's sound asleep)   (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's in a grouchy mood. Kramer enters) KRAMER  (Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng! JERRY  (Out of it) Yeah, good morning. KRAMER  Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)  JERRY  She's not there. She's doin' her wash.  KRAMER  (Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?  JERRY  (Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!  KRAMER  So, you're still master of your domain.  JERRY  (Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and   I'm tellin' her to put those shades down! KRAMER  Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?  JERRY  I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in   this contest - something's gotta give! KRAMER  Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to   stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.  JERRY  (Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.  KRAMER  (Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our   noise) throw it away?! JERRY  Look, I'm sorry- KRAMER  No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.  JERRY  Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!  KRAMER  (Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm   beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!  (A pause as Jerry thinks it over) JERRY  Alright.. (Takes his coat off) KRAMER  Yes! JERRY  ..Alright. KRAMER  (Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)  JERRY  She's not there! KRAMER  Oh, I can wait..  (Monk's Coffee shop)  (Jerry and George are sitting opposite each other in a booth)  JERRY  So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?  GEORGE  Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.  JERRY  Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.  GEORGE  (Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..   (Jerry nods) JERRY  (Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?  GEORGE  (Arms out) I am king of the county. You?  JERRY  Lord of the manor.  (Elaine enters and sits next to Jerry) ELAINE  John F. Kennedy Jun-ya! JERRY  What? ELAINE  (Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.  JERRY  Really? Did you talk to him? ELAINE  No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at   the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) \"Quite a workout.\"  GEORGE  \"Quite a workout\"? What did you say?  ELAINE  (Smiling, proud) I said, \"yeah.\" JERRY  (Adding, fake praise) Good one. ELAINE  So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and   And I said, \"Sure\" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior   we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, \"Where do you live?\" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he   dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her   forehead to cool her off) Oh, God.. JERRY  But the question is, are you still master of your domain?  ELAINE  (Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)   (Estelle's hospital room)  (George quickly runs in, turning around - he checks both his watch and the wall clock. He smiles to himself)  ESTELLE  You're back. GEORGE  Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.  ESTELLE  I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.  GEORGE  You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?  ESTELLE  You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a   sandwich.. GEORGE  (Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)  ESTELLE  (Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.  GEORGE  Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?  ESTELLE  I don't understand why you can't do this for me!  GEORGE  (Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.  ESTELLE  But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!  GEORGE  Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.  ESTELLE  Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.   (Nurse enters) NURSE  (To patient) Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath.   (George eagerly takes his seat, looking up at their shadows on the divider)  ESTELLE  George.. I'm huuunnnggry! GEORGE  (Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..   (New York Health Club)  (Elaine, dressed to impress, walks up to the counter. She's obviously looking around for JFK Jr.)  JOYCE  Hi! ELAINE  Hi. JOYCE  Did you get your hair done today? ELAINE  No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)  JOYCE  You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. (Elaine looses her composure) But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.  ELAINE  (Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?  JOYCE  Let me just put this back. (Turns to put a stack of shorts away)   (Elaine violently grabs her jacket, pulling Joyce back in her direction)  ELAINE  No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!  JOYCE  (Uneasy) He asked about you. ELAINE  (Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?  JOYCE  He wanted to know your situation. ELAINE  (Quick) What situation? I have a situation?  JOYCE  I-I told him you were single. ELAINE  That was good. That was very good.  JOYCE  He said you were just his type. ELAINE  (Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.  JOYCE  He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to   come down and say hello.  (Breathless, Elaine almost collapses)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Kramer's at the window while Jerry's on the phone with his mother, watching TV)  JERRY  Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent,   wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)  KRAMER  (Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at   Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..  JERRY  (Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The   wheels on the bus..  (Kramer joins in with Jerry, only, he has a different version)  KRAMER  The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..   (Both Kramer and Jerry continue to sing the two different versions, trying to over ride the other)   (George's room)  (George is wide awake, staring at the ceiling. Scene cuts to Jerry. Once again, he's restless and flings the covers off him. Scene cuts to Kramer - he's out like a light.   The scene takes a final cut to Elaine. Foreshadowing the next scene, she's sound asleep too)   (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and George. They're bickering at each other due to the lack of sex)  GEORGE  All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?  JERRY  I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!  ELAINE  (Through intercom) It's Elaine. JERRY  (Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)  GEORGE  Where did you get those socks? JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  I think those are my socks! JERRY  How are these your socks?! GEORGE  I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!  JERRY  (Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to   have them! GEORGE  Yeah, well, they're my socks! JERRY  They're my socks!  (A brief moment passes as they look at each other) GEORGE  Oh boy.. JERRY  What are we doing here.. GEORGE  ..Oh boy. JERRY  This is ridiculous. GEORGE  Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.  JERRY  I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.  GEORGE  Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.   (Elaine slowly enters, shutting the door behind her) ELAINE  Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)  GEORGE  (Shocked) You caved?! JERRY  It's over? GEORGE  You're out? JERRY  Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.  (Elaine sets the bills down on the counter) GEORGE  I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.  JERRY  What happened? ELAINE  It was..uh.. John-John. JERRY AND GEORGE  Ohhhhh.. John-John. JERRY  But you made it through the day before.  ELAINE  Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.  JERRY  Why outside here? ELAINE  Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.   (George picks up the money, counting it) JERRY  Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.  GEORGE  And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.  ELAINE  (Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..   (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and Marla are making out on the couch) MARLA  Let's go in the bedroom. JERRY  Really? MARLA  Yes. JERRY  You sure? MARLA  Yes. JERRY  You really want to? MARLA  I do. I'm ready. JERRY  Okay.. MARLA  I know how difficult this must have been for you.  JERRY  (Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.   (They both laugh slightly) MARLA  What do you mean? JERRY  Well, it's kinda silly, but..  (Scene cuts to Elaine on the sidewalk waiting for JFK Jr. She checks her watch. Scene cuts back to Jerry's apartment. Marla, obviously upset, is putting her coat   on) MARLA  Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?  JERRY  No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-  MARLA  I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.   (She leaves, slamming the door. Jerry hangs his head, then directs his attention to his window. Eagerly walking over, he sits in his chair, staring at the woman)   (Scene cuts to Elaine. Marla walks out in front of her, trying to hail a taxi)  ELAINE  Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-  MARLA  I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.   Horrible! All of you!  (Jerry's apartment) ELAINE  What happened? JERRY  I told her about the contest. ELAINE  Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.  (George enters) GEORGE  (To Elaine) Hey, what happened? ELAINE  What? GEORGE  I thought you were meeting Kennedy.  ELAINE  (Let down) He didn't show. GEORGE  Yeah, he did. ELAINE  What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..  GEORGE  No, no, no. He just left. ELAINE  What? GEORGE  Yeah, he was talking to Marla. JERRY  Marla? GEORGE  Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.  ELAINE  (Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?  GEORGE  Yeah. ELAINE  They drove away? GEORGE  Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-  JERRY  (Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!   (All three crowd around the window) ELAINE  (Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?  GEORGE  Kramer?!  (A brief pause) ELAINE  He's waving..  (All three wave back)  (Elaine's bedroom)  (Elaine's sound asleep. Scene cuts to George, then Jerry. They too, are sleeping. Scene takes a cut to Kramer and the nudist - both asleep; then a final cut to Marla's   bedroom. She's sleeping with JFK Jr) MARLA  Ohh, John. That was wonderful..   THE END>",

        "text": "  THE AIRPORT Written by  Larry Charles   (Comedy club) JERRY  ...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; there's always a small problem \"There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a *little* late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! We're just trying to get one of those *little* trucks to pull us up just a *little* closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!\".   Open with Jerry and Elaine in a car on their way to the airport. Elaine is singing a poppy Jazz tune.  ELAINE  Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...  JERRY  Hey, could you do me a favour? (pause) Could you shut-up?They both chortle, and Jerry is hot so he's taking his coat off, but Elaine refuses to take the wheel and Jerry's hand gets stuck and before you can say \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", they collide head-on with a Snapple truck....   Would you believe a big purple jeep?  Okay, they don't hit anything, but Jerry's hand *did* get stuck...   Anyhoots, Elaine goes to roll down the window, and... ELAINE  Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.  JERRY  I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work,   the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker...   (pause) Or is that you? ELAINE  Gimme ten bucks and find out... JERRY  So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to   see your sister... ELAINE  Yeah, worked out good. JERRY  And here's the beauty-- ELAINE  What? JERRY  George is pickin' us up at the airport.  ELAINE  Get out of here! Why? JERRY  You know that awning outside my building?  ELAINE  Yeah... JERRY  He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.  ELAINE  So what happened? JERRY  He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it...   So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have   to pay me anything. ELAINE  Hey, how we doin' on time? JERRY  Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...   Oops. ELAINE  Hey! Wait up! JERRY  Hey! Wait up! DRIVER  Sorry. Heh heh heh...  The driver speeds away without our heroes, and he seems pretty happy about it.   Finally inside, they check their luggage... SKYCAP  Where you goin'? JERRY  Uh, JFK. (To Elaine) I need some small bills for a tip. You   got anything? ELAINE  Yeah, you want five? JERRY  Gimme ten. ELAINE  You're giving him *ten* dollars? JERRY  Well, we got three bags. ELAINE  That's a pretty big tip... JERRY  That's what they get! ELAINE  They don't get that much. JERRY  Let's ask him. ELAINE  We can't ask him... JERRY  Let's see what he says. ELAINE  Jerry, we don't have time for this...  JERRY  Two seconds. (To Skycap) Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.  SKYCAP  Depends on the person, depends on the bag.  JERRY  Uh, how about a couple of people like us.  SKYCAP  People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like   you know what you're doing... JERRY  C'mon, seriously... SKYCAP  Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag.   What!? ELAINE  What!? SKYCAP  That's right.  *Five* bucks a bag? ELAINE  *Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.  SKYCAP  Look, you asked, I told you. ELAINE  You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...  JERRY  All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...  ELAINE  You're lucky I don't report you...  SKYCAP  JFK... THEN ELAINE'S SKYCAP  ...Honolulu.  Inside the gate, J+E are running to get to the ticket counter in time.  ELAINE  Wait up! JERRY  You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man!   Get your knees up!  Yeah, but Jerry-- she's so darned perky when she runs. Besides, she's carrying luggage and you're not. Some gentleman. Hmfph. Anyway, they get to the ticket counter.  JERRY+ELAINE  The flight's been canceled?!?! TICKET LADY  Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats   into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now.  JERRY  We'll take 'em! ELAINE  We're not going to sit together? JERRY  Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.  ELAINE  Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.  JERRY  We'll call him... ELAINE  There's no time. JERRY  No time? (To ticket lady) Is there time?  TLADY  There's no time. JERRY  There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.  TLADY  I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.  JERRY  I'll take the first class. ELAINE  Jerry! JERRY  What? ELAINE  Why should you get the first class?  JERRY  Elaine, have you ever flown first class?  ELAINE  No. JERRY  All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've   flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...  ELAINE  You flew here coach. JERRY  Yeah, that's a point... ELAINE  All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.  JERRY  Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.  They board the plane, and the flight attendant \"welcomes\" Elaine aboard.  ATTENDANT #1  Third row right...  Then Mr. First class Jerry comes aboard. ATTENDANT #1  Oh, you're in here, sir. Welcome aboard.  JERRY  Bon voyage, Lainey! PASSENGER #1  Oh, excuse me... Um, excuse me, miss, I think you're   sitting in my seat...  Elaine moves over, and he moves in. The guy's got like 5 bags and Data General laptop.  PASSENGER #1  I never check my bags-- I can't stand that wait in the baggage area.  ELAINE  Great... (To herself) Help me... TIA  Excuse me, I think you're in my seat...  JERRY  Oh, sorry... My mistake... (To himself) Thank... *you*!   Did I mention that Tia is one hot tamale? Yikes.  Anyway, we cut back to George and Kramer in the car. GEORGE  Hey, thanks for coming with me. KRAMER  Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?  GEORGE  I confused it with another awning.  KRAMER  So how we doin' on time? GEORGE  We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up.   I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup.   Um, George... Did you say \"perfect\"? GEORGE  What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway?   What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!  KRAMER  Will you relax?! GEORGE  Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck!   You destroyed my whole timing! KRAMER  This is the best way to go! GEORGE  Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...  KRAMER  George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...  GEORGE  Really? KRAMER  If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to   go to the Duty Free shop. GEORGE  The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail.   Do you know how much duty is? KRAMER  Duty. GEORGE  Yeah, \"duty\". Do you know how much duty is?  KRAMER  No, I dunno how much duty is. GEORGE  Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...  KRAMER  I still like to stop at the duty free shop.  GEORGE  I like to stop at the duty free shop.  G+K  I like to stop at the duty free shop!   I like to stop at the duty free shop!  Meanwhile, back on the plane, Jerry and Tia are chatting (isn't that always the way? You get stuck beside someone who insists on going on and on about their kids and how their life didn't go according to plan and all that boring dreck...)  TIA  So, he says, \"squeeze your breasts together\", and I say, \"I thought this was an ad for shoes\"...  JERRY  Oh my...  Okay, maybe not all conversations are dull and boring... TIA  Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.   Oh yeah, did I mention he had a magazine on his lap and *that's* what she was gawking at? Anyway, he checks out page 146.  JERRY  Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you   that washcloth to cover yourself up...  Um, what was that page number again? JERRY  What is this an ad for? TIA  See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?  JERRY  Uh-huh...  In traffic, Kramer and George are surrounded by honking cars and what is obviously heavy traffic...  KRAMER  How does it look on your side? (Pause while George just stares at him) We'll get there...   Back in, ugh, *coach* (those heathens), the annoying guy is sleeping beside  ELAINE  Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... (To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself) Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.  GEORGE  They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!  KRAMER  Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!  GEORGE  Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.  KRAMER  No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.  GEORGE  Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!  KRAMER  Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.  GROSSBARD  Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30... (He leaves)  KRAMER  Did you see that guy? GEORGE  No... What guy? KRAMER  That guy.. He was just... GEORGE  Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!  KRAMER  (still lost) I know that guy...  Y'know, he looks familiar to me, too. Reminds me of this guy John Grossbard that I knew a while back. Got me involved in one of those shady pyramid schemes... Man, if I ever meet up with him again...  PRISONER  Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.  GUARD  Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.   George lifts the last copy from the rack before the con can get it.  PRISONER  Hey, I was gonna take that! GEORGE  Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.  PRISONER  I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine...  GEORGE  You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!  PRISONER  A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!  GUARD  All right, let's go...  George checks out the cover shot which shows a picture of the aforementioned prisoner with the caption \"Caught!\" written below.  PRISONER  I want the magazine! GEORGE  Umm... No. PRISONER  You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles...  GEORGE  But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!   Kramer comes into the gift shop and does a Krameresque double-take at \"that guy\" from the departure screen who's browsing books. He goes up to   George. KRAMER  They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.  GEORGE  Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...  KRAMER  Where do I know that guy from?  Back in the developing nation section of the plane (coach, that is), Elaine is still pining for the guy next to her to wake up so she can go to the bathroom.  ELAINE  (To herself, loudly) Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake*   *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! (To the slug out loud) Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...   The cad has the nerve to look peeved, and Elaine has a hard time getting out of her seat. She looks a little like Kramer stumbling and falling into the aisle. The capper is that as she's getting up, facing the row of seats (and their staring sitters) across from her, Elaine makes faces at them like she's a homicidal maniac from \"Taxi Driver\". You can just see the words \"You lookin' at *me*?\" etched in her brain. It's a killer.   Anyway, as Elaine scurries off to the bathroom, Jerry and Tia are enjoying some hot towels on their faces.  JERRY  Oh my... that *is* refreshing... ATTENDANT  Would you care for some slippers? JERRY  Sounds lovely! (To Tia, motioning to put them on her) May I?  TIA  Please! JERRY  Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.   They chortle to themselves and tink glasses (no, that's not a cleverly- masked euphemism). Back in the car...  GEORGE  My name is not mentioned in this blurb...   Ding! KRAMER  It's Grossbard!  Why don't these people listen to me? I don't understand... GEORGE  Who's Grossbard? KRAMER  When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month,   he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and )pfffft( disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went   to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!  GEORGE  Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...  KRAMER  No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...  GEORGE  No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract.   We... we must go forward... not back.  George, that's beautiful. Ever thought of running for office?  JERRY  Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.  ATTENDANT  They're gardenias, mostly. JERRY  I thought I smelled lilac. ATTENDANT  Yes, there are a few of those, too...  TIA  It's almost overwhelming... CAPTAIN  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been   instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...  ELAINE  (To anyone who'll listen) What'd he say? What'd he say?   Back to George and Kramer at Laguardia; George has been inside to see if J+E are there, he reports his findings back to Kramer in the car.  GEORGE  Well, You're not gonna believe it...  KRAMER  What? GEORGE  The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.  KRAMER  Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.   Kramer peels out. He's on a mission from God. ATTENDANT  We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite.   Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron.  JERRY  Oh, saffron! That sounds good. ATTENDANT  And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region...  JERRY+TIA  Tuscany!  They do that \"tink\" thing again, and we rejoin Elaine going back to her seat, but the other attendant is serving the slop to the unwashed masses   in coach and he's in her way. ELAINE  Hi. Can I get to my seat? ATTENDANT  You're just gonna have to wait... ELAINE  But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...  ATTENDANT  You're not supposed to get up during the food service.  ELAINE  Well, nobody *told* me that! ATTENDANT  Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve.   Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.  Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the Arrivals board (again)...  GEORGE  There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.  KRAMER  Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to   catch him! GEORGE  How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.  KRAMER  Gimme your credit card. GEORGE  My credit card? KRAMER  Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.  GEORGE  I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!  KRAMER  I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.  GEORGE  What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.  KRAMER  No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get   off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.  GEORGE  This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer   miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as   your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.   Back in *coach* (I get hives just thinking about it), Elaine returns to her   seat now that the attendant is done serving. ELAINE  Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through.   There's no way to get around that cart... PASSENGER 1  You're not supposed to get up during the food service.  ELAINE  I'll try and remember that. (Pause) Where's my meal?  PASSENGER 1  He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats.   Uh-huh... Elaine addresses the nearby attendant. ELAINE  Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.  ATTENDANT  Are you sure? ELAINE  Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.  ATTENDANT  Would you?  Ooooh, them's fightin' words, Monroe. ATTENDANT  Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.  ELAINE  Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.  PASSENGER 1  I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something.  PASSENGER 2  No, no. It all has to do with the way they kill the pig.  PASSENGER 1  They don't eat pigs! PASSENGER 2  They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's supervision.   Ummmm, sure. Another (uncredited) passenger addresses the debate from somewhere out of camera range.  PASSENGER 3  Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher meal.  ELAINE  Then why didn't you take it? PASSENGER 3  I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot.  ELAINE  You're eating my food! ATTENDANT  Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not.   Take the food, Elaine. But ask that guy just what the heck a kosher meal is-- I'm curious...   Meanwhile, Jerry and Tia enjoy a nummy-lookin' dessert treat.  J+T  Mmmmmmmm! TIA  This is the best sundae I've ever had.  JERRY  Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see?   That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.  TIA  I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.  JERRY  Thank you... J+T  Mmmmmm!  We get a quick shot of Elaine staring at *something* on the end of her fork  ATTENDANT  More anything? JERRY  More everything!  Does that include Rabbi-slaughtered bovines?  Back at JFK... KRAMER  Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon. GEORGE  Super Savers? Are they refundable!?   No. GEORGE  You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!  KRAMER  She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.  GEORGE  Do you know how much this is going to cost me?  KRAMER  Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you   How big of you, you brute. They board the plane. GEORGE  Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...   I dunno, George. Those *coach* bathrooms stink. Just ask Elaine.   Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard. For his part, Grossbard doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago (then again, he apparently had short hair at the time). After trying in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom door to a reply of \"Just a minute\" from the occupant inside (I bet he stinks). Anyway, the door opens and, surprise! It's the Prisoner without his Time magazine (at least now we know why he needed it so badly-- reading material for the john). Anyway, the guy pulls George into the bathroom (he's still wearing his cuffs and shackles, BTW (that's got to make it rather difficult to go to the bathroom, but I digress)). So, while George is in the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet. And what's up with going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane? Isn't there laws against that? Or is it just trains that you have to wait until they're moving? Who really cares, anyway?  ATTENDANT  Excuse me... Excuuuse me... ELAINE  What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.  ATTENDANT  What is your name? ELAINE  Elaine Benes? ATTENDANT  (Checks her list) You're going to have to go back to coach.  ELAINE  No, but there was nobody sitting here...  ATTENDANT  Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive.  ELAINE  Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... (She notices another attendant offering goods)   Oh, you got *cookies*! ATTENDANT  You're going to have to go back to your seat!  ELAINE  Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! (She goes through the curtain to,ick, *coach*) Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!   The outburst has awoken Jerry and Tia who are sharing a blanket and napping (at least, that's what I *think* they're doing under that big, blue blanket...)  JERRY  What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with.   (To attendant) What is going on? ATTENDANT  Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class.  JERRY  Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.   Electrified, with a moat if possible. They return to snuggling...  KRAMER  Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!  No good. He breaks free and makes a run for it and seemingly escapes.   Meanwhile, Jerry is getting ready for deboarding and he glances out the window only to see a rather harried Kramer running, arms flailing out on the runway. He takes a second look, just to be sure.  JERRY  Couldn't be...  After they get off the plane, J+E look for the boys and get their baggage  how would they know Kramer was there, too? They didn't get a hold of George on the phone, or he would've went to Laguardia in the first   place...) JERRY  Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere...   Well, George is being raped in a bathroom and Kramer is still on the lam somewhere in the airport...  JERRY  I got my bags, I'm ready to go. ELAINE  Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...  In Honolulu, Elaine's bag appears to be having a good time, revolving around the baggage thingy, complete with lei...  ELAINE  The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.  JERRY  Yeah, me too...  He seems so sincere. Tia walks by, along with an entourage of photographers.  TIA  I'll call you. JERRY  Okay... (To a bamboozled Elaine) It's a business thing...   Enter the K-man through the ramp where the baggage comes out-- you didn't expect a whole episode to go by without a \"Kramer entrance\", did you?  KRAMER  You guys ready? JERRY  Yeah. Where's George? GEORGE  Well, you can't hear him through the window, but he is definitely shouting   \"KRAMER!\" JERRY  But I have to admit, I like flying. I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there. The worst way of flying, I think is \"standby\", you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they call it standby--   you stand there going \"Bye!\" So I was on this flight where the flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't have a uniform for her yet, and that really... makes a big difference,   I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going \"Would you mind bringing your seat back all the way up?\" It's like, \"Who the Hell are you?!\"   THE END>",

I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.  JERRY  You walk around with no underwear?  GEORGE  Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?  JERRY  I do a wash. GEORGE  Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.  JERRY  When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.  GEORGE  I loved her! JERRY  You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.  GEORGE  I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.  GEORGE  I gotta call her. Should I call her?  JERRY  George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?  GEORGE  Whyie? JERRY  You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.  GEORGE  I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.  JERRY  No, no no (Elaine enters, flossing teeth) Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.  ELAINE  Dana Folley. JERRY  Right, Dana Folley. GEORGE  She any good? ELAINE  Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?  GEORGE  Wa, uh, ... ELAINE  Tia? Who's that? JERRY  She's the model I met on the plane.  ELAINE  She sent you a Christmas card? JERRY  Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.  GEORGE  My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!  (They ignore George) JERRY  What are you doing? ELAINE  ... date with Fred. JERRY  The religious guy? ELAINE  He's not THAT religious. JERRY  Let us pray.  (Kramer Enters) KRAMER  Hey, you got any Double Crunch? JERRY  Yeah. JERRY  Kramer, should I call Susan? KRAMER  Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.  GEORGE  My little man doesn't know. KRAMER  The little man knows all. GEORGE  My little man's an idiot. ELAINE  See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.  KRAMER  You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...  GEORGE  She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.  ELAINE  No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.  KRAMER  No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.  GEORGE  She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.  KRAMER  All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.  ELAINE  Really? Can you really take a picture?  JERRY  Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.  ELAINE  All right, ha ha KRAMER  I don't know about that outfit though.  ELAINE  Why? What's wrong with it? KRAMER  Well, we'll have to improvise.  (Elaine and Kramer exit) GEORGE  (singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...  JERRY  George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.   (Change of Scne Tia at Jerry's) JERRY  So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.  TIA  Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?  JERRY  Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.  TIA  That's horrible! JERRY  What's that perfume you're wearing?  TIA  oh I completely forgot I want you to see this. The CALVIN KLEIN ad I was telling you about came out today.  JERRY  What is that smell? TIA  It's here somewhere. JERRY  It smells like the beach. TIA  Exactly. JERRY  Oh my God is that the new perfume?  TIA  Yeah. JERRY  I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.  TIA  Are you sure? JERRY  And you're the model for this perfume?   (Noise) JERRY  Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door (Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance)  KRAMER  Hey JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Hey, how ya' doing? (Trying to enter)  JERRY  Yeah, uh, I'll see you later. KRAMER  I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.  JERRY  All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.  KRAMER  Hello.  (Jerry pushes tia back away from Kramer) KRAMER  How tall are you? TIA  Five ten. KRAMER  Come on lets see - Back to Back. JERRY  NO! Kramer! KRAMER  What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.  JERRY  Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.  KRAMER  What's that? JERRY  What? KRAMER  That smell. What's that smell? JERRY  (starting the Dust Buster) What smell?  KRAMER  It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.  JERRY  Oh, they're all the same. Here. (gives him Dust Buster) Now if you'll excuse us, ..  KRAMER  Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?  JERRY  Okay. KRAMER  Yeah. Nice meeting you. TIA  Nice meeting you too. JERRY  I'll see you later.  (Kramer slowly leaves as Jerry shuts door on him) JERRY  Ooow, that was close. KRAMER  (OC) THE BEACH!!!  (enters) KRAMER  You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.  TIA  It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN. KRAMER  CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.  JERRY  I know look at this (shows ad) KRAMER  Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.   (End of scene)  (Therapist's Office)  (George enters) DANA  Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down.  GEORGE  Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me (struggling with his coat zipper) and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?  DANA  So uh, she broke up with you? ... GEORGE  Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?  DANA  It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?  GEORGE  What is with this damn zipper? DANA  It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.  GEORGE  It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.  DANA  It doesn't matter, so ... GEORGE  This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...  DANA  George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?  GEORGE  ... Susan. DANA  Okay, we're getting somewhere. GEORGE  UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.   (Jerry's Apartment) ELAINE  Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.  JERRY  Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.  ELAINE  It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.  JERRY  I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?  ELAINE  Well, you know. It's a picture? JERRY  Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.  ELAINE  Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?  JERRY  ... um ... ELAINE  What? JERRY  Did you look at look at this picture carefully?  ELAINE  Carefully? JERRY  Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  Here. Take a look. What, what is that?  ELAINE  (gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.  JERRY  That's what I thought. ELAINE  That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.  JERRY  DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE? ELAINE  Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey! ELAINE  Have you seen the card? KRAMER  What card? ELAINE  This car. KRAMER  Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it. ELAINE  Well did you notice anything unusual about it?  KRAMER  No. ELAINE  Well come here and take a look. KRAMER  Yeah, so? ELAINE  So, what's that? KRAMER  That's a nipple. ELAINE  Right!! KRAMER  Ooo! ELAINE  Aw, great!? Didn't you see that? KRAMER  Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,  ELAINE  It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.  JERRY  Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.  ELAINE  No. I don't want him looking. JERRY  Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.  ELAINE  Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.   (Jerry enters with Newman) NX  Okay. What is it? JERRY  Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.  NX  Your nipple's showing. JERRY  Okay. Thanks. NX  Anything else? JERRY  No. NX  All right. See you later. JERRY  What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.  KRAMER  I got them too. JERRY  Everybody's got them.  (Therapist's Office) DANA  You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...  GEORGE  Pull it up a little bit. DANA  Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it.  GEORGE  Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.  DANA  No. Let me try... GEORGE  Take it right off the chest... DANA  Ugh, .. GEORGE  You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.  DANA  YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.  GEORGE  Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?  DANA  Yeah. GEORGE  (stares at card)  (Jerry's car - BMW)  (Jerry scratching right side of nose. Tia in a cab sees him, in shock. Cab pulls away.)  JERRY  No, No, No, No, Oh, No.  (Jerry's Apartment)  (Jerry hanging up phone) JERRY  Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.  GEORGE  Was it a scratch or a pick? JERRY  It was a scratch. GEORGE  Hey. It's me. JERRY  Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?   (Buzzer) JERRY  Yeah? ELAINE  (OC) It's me. JERRY  Come on up. GEORGE  Was there any nostril penetration?  JERRY  There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.  GEORGE  So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?  JERRY  Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?  GEORGE  I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.  JERRY  Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?  GEORGE  No. That's disgusting!  (Elaine enters) ELAINE  You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... (sees card) Oh please!  GEORGE  Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.  ELAINE  You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. (rubs George's head on her breasts) Here's your Christmas card.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Got any Double Crunch? JERRY  yeah. I think I do. KRAMER  What's that perfume? ELAINE  What, Ocean. KRAMER  That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.  JERRY  I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.  KRAMER  I thought you said it was a scratch.  JERRY  But that's not what she thinks. GEORGE  Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.  JERRY  All right. I'll call the agency. (Elaine grabs card from George) Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. (hangs up) She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.  KRAMER  Let's go.  (Monk's) GEORGE  It'll be different this time. SUSAN  I need someone a little more stable.  GEORGE  I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!  SUSAN  People don't change. GEORGE  I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.  SUSAN  I'm not a soft boiled egg. GEORGE  And I am not a piece of toast. SUSAN  I just don't think we have anything in common.  GEORGE  That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.  SUSAN  Why were there so many cockroaches?  GEORGE  Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments (grins)  SUSAN  And they got along? GEORGE  Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!   (Trump Towers) KRAMER  I want to talk to Calvin. SECRETARY  You can't go in there. KRAMER  Let me talk to Calvin.  (Kramer enters office) TIA  Kramer? KRAMER  Yeah, uh. CALVIN KLEIN  Who are you? KRAMER  I'm here to talk about the ocean. CALVIN KLEIN  Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about this. Will you excuse us Tia? (Tia leaves)  KRAMER  Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.  CALVIN KLEIN  Neither do I.  (Outside office) JERRY  Hello there you are. TIA  What are you doing here? JERRY  Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.  TIA  Well, I've been busy. JERRY  Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he   indicates a nose pick) TIA  (Waving him off) I'd rather not talk about this..  JERRY  But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.  TIA  I know what I saw. (Turns toward the elevators)  JERRY  But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!  TIA  I gotta go. (Quickly walks away from Jerry)  JERRY  No! No pick!  (Scene ends) Calvin Klein's office)  (Kramer, standing, is talking with Klein) KRAMER  All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..  KLEIN  (Reflecting on Kramer) Interesting face..  KRAMER  Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.  KLEIN  You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful.  KRAMER  Well, yeah. KLEIN  Sit down, eh? (Kramer, misjudging one side of the couch, sits down uncomfortably) You're very lean, but muscular..  KRAMER  You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.  KLEIN  You're spectacular. KRAMER  (Flattered) Oh?  (Scene ends) Elaine's office)  (Elaine's fighting with her boyfriend, Fred, about her Christmas card)  ELAINE  I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.  FRED  (Incredulous) Soo - what happened?!  ELAINE  Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.  FRED  I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.  ELAINE  Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..  RECEPTIONIST  Your sister, Gail. ELAINE  Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.  CO-WORKER  (Pokes his head into the doorway) Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?  ELAINE  Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me \"Nip\"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well..   well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.  (Scene ends) Susan's apartment building)  (George and Susan are slowly making their way up the stars to Susan's apartment. He's treating it very much like the long walk to an execution; she's mellow and   happy)  (Scene ends) Calvin Klein's office)  (A couple people are sitting with Klein, and talking. Kramer is no where in sight)  WOMAN  About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only   dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!  KLEIN  His buttocks are sublime! MAN  Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.  WOMAN  (Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.   (Kramer casually puts his hand on the wall, attempting to lean on it, but the corner is rounded, and he slides along it, eventually falling down. Fortunately, the other   people don't notice - they're talking amongst themselves) MAN  You've done it again, C.K.!  (Scene ends) Calvin Klein office building)  (In a hallway, Tia and others are waiting for the elevator. Jerry, deciding to make a speach, starts to preach to the crowd)  JERRY  An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those   Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you..   (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the   hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!   (Scene ends) Elaine's office)  (Elaine's standing in the doorway, yelling at Fred) ELAINE  I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!   (Scene ends)  (Monk's) GX  So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.  JERRY  The pick? ELAINE  The pick? GEORGE  She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.  JERRY  I think I've seen that look.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.  JERRY  Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.  GEORGE  Your buttocks are spectacular. ELAINE  Oh my! KRAMER  What? ELAINE  I'm not sure but... I think I see your...

Didja   ever notice, they never hire anyone between the ages of fifteen...   and eighty, you know what I mean? Like, the girl that sells you the   ticket, she's ten. Then there's the guy who rips the ticket, he's a   hundred and two. So, what happened in the middle, there? You   couldn't find anybody? It's like they want to show you how life   comes full circle. You're fifteen, you sell the tickets. Then you   leave, you go out, you have a family, kids, marriage, career,   grandchildren, eighty years later, you're back in the same theater   three feet away. Ripping tickets. Took you eighty years to move   three feet. 32 seconds) JERRY  You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another  KERNIS  I hear you, guy. JERRY  And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the   material! KERNIS  Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?  JERRY  No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie \"CheckMate\"  AT 10  30. BUCKLES  Hey, Jer! JERRY  (not losing a step) Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... (and out the door)  GEORGE  Excuse me, do you have a ticket? MAN  No. GEORGE  Okay. Good. BUCKLES  Jerry! JERRY  What are (you) doing here? BUCKLES  Hey, do you think this is funny? \"Why do they call it athlete's   foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my   father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!\"  ELAINE  I've been *dying* to see \"CheckMate\".  GEORGE  Well, if it's as good as \"Ponce de Leon\", I'll be happy.  ELAINE  \"Ponce de Leon\", are you kidding me? I hated that movie!  GEORGE  \"Ponce de Leon\"? But that was great!  ELAINE  Oh, (come on). That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where   they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the   mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! (laughing too   hard to continue) That's stupid! GEORGE  Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw   that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his   cheek? ... I lost it. KRAMER  Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.  G+E  No, wait! GEORGE  You're not going to get back here in time!  KRAMER  I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!  ELAINE  You can get a hot dog in the theater.  KRAMER  I don't wanna get a movie hot dog!   (in tears) I want a Papaya King hot dog! ELAINE  Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is   going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.  KRAMER  Well, just save me a seat. ELAINE  No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once   had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving   incident! GEORGE  I'm in line to buy. ELAINE  No, George, this is the ticket-(holders) line.  GEORGE  No it's not, it's the ticket-(buyers) line.  ELAINE  Then how come we're not moving? KRAMER  Good question. GEORGE  Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?  MAN  Holders. GEORGE  But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!  MAN  I didn't. My friend was getting it.  GEORGE  (furious) Good. It's good to be accurate like that.  ELAINE  Can you believe him? KRAMER  He's spaced out. ELAINE  How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?  KRAMER  (thinks for a while) ELAINE  (gives up) Yeah, exactly... ELAINE  I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!  GEORGE  It's the same movie! What's the difference?  ELAINE  It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to   show them propaganda films. JERRY  (to taxi driver) Take the Park! BUCKLES  No no no, take 55th. BUCKLES  Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!  JERRY  (rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end)   Okay, I get your point! BUCKLES  I had a point? GEORGE  Hey, you know what else is playing here? \"Rochelle Rochelle\".  ELAINE  Sigh/Ugh. GEORGE  I wouldn't mind seein' (that). ELAINE  Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if   there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will  take her top off. GEORGE  So what's your point? GEORGE  By the way, you owe me seven fifty.  ELAINE  Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?  GEORGE  No, I don't have any change. ELAINE  Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.  GEORGE  Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.  ELAINE  Yeah, you *could*... GEORGE  Might be easier. ELAINE  I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve   fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty. GEORGE  (trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we   know better) Either way. ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  So... Can I have it? ELAINE  I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.  GEORGE  Whaddya mean, you'll \"get\" the popcorn and the soda?  ELAINE  I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.  GEORGE  I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy   *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons. ELAINE  (exasperated) George, you're sappin' my strength.  GEORGE  You go in and save seats. ELAINE  (in a panic) Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three   seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!  BUCKLES  Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.  JERRY  That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.  BUCKLES  Jerry! Don't start up with me! JERRY  I gotta get out of this cab... BUCKLES  But Jerry, quit riffing! JERRY  No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the   difference? BUCKLES  (pause) Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?  ELAINE  No, these are saved. MAN  All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.  ELAINE  What, is that a rule? GEORGE  Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you   didn't like saving anyway. ELAINE  (stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her)   No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken.  (to George) (shrugs) I'm getting the hang of it. GEORGE  Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change,   and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle. ELAINE  Can we do this later, George? GEORGE  Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? (condescendingly   takes her hand and pats it) You'll give me the money when you have   it. (takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders)   I, I trust you. KRAMER  Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven,   he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's   going to be right back, okay? ELAINE  No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ...

Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in   the world. BUCKLES  We should see \"Rochelle Rochelle\". I hear it's really hot.  JERRY  No thanks, maybe some other time. BUCKLES  Really? Do you really mean that? JERRY  No, I don't. BUCKLES  You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?  JERRY  No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.  JERRY  Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em.   Mind if I walk through real quick? USHER  (indicates \"okay\") KRAMER  Hey, did that guy show up? CLERK  The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...  KRAMER  No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.  CLERK  Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses...

WOMAN  And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a   show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to \"A Chorus   Line\", I mean you can see he's got talent. ELAINE  (annoyed) Excuse me, excuse me. WOMAN  What's the problem? ELAINE  (momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident)   You're talking. WOMAN  It's the \"Coming Attractions\". WOMAN  So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten   into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe... USHER  Ticket, sir? GEORGE  Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?

CLERK  Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?  ELAINE  What's the difference? CLERK  Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo.

Gimme the large. CLERK  That's medium. ELAINE  Right. Yeah. (fearing the answer) Could I have a small popcorn?  CLERK  There is no small. (flash of perky inspiration) Child-size is small.

JERRY  I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot.   It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit,  but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie  guy from the (beginning)... Ohhhhhhhhhh...\" Nobody will explain it   to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out.  (whispering to imaginary friends seated around him) \"Why did they   kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What   was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why   would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with   them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed  him.\"      THE END>",

        "text": "   THE VISA Written by  Peter Mehlman   (Comedy club)  What are lawyers, really? To me a lawyer is basically the person that knows the rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our pieces around the board, but if there's a problem, the lawyer is the only person that has read the inside of the top of the box. I think one of the fun things for them is to say, \"objection.\" \"Objection! Objection, your Honor.\" Objection, of course, is the adult version of, \"Fraid not.\" To which the judge can say two things, he can say, \"overruled\" which is the adult version of \"Fraid so,\" or he could say, \"sustained,\" which is the adult version of \"Duh.\"   First scene.  George is at the counter at Monk's, he's talking with an Oriental woman.  GEORGE  So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?  CHERYL  Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.  GEORGE  What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?  CHERYL  Are your friends as funny as you? GEORGE  No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.  Quick pan to the front door as Jerry and Elaine are entering.  ELAINE  Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you  JERRY  Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.  ELAINE  It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.  JERRY  Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.  Cut back to George and Cheryl at the counter. CHERYL  Here's my card. GEORGE  Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.  CHERYL  Nice meeting you. GEORGE  Yeah.  Cheryl leaves, George walks over to the booth to meet Jerry and Elaine.  ELAINE  Hi! JERRY  Hey, how ya doin? GEORGE  You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter. ELAINE  What, the one who just left? GEORGE  Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go. ELAINE  Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.  JERRY  Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over)   Hey, Babu! BABU  Jerry! JERRY  Look at you, you got the job. BABU  Yes, yes, they give me job thanks to you.  JERRY  Oh, I didn't do anything. BABU  Yes, you do everything, get me job, you get me a place to live in your   building. JERRY  Come on. BABU  You very very good man, you do everything for me. My family and I can never thank you enough for everything you do.  Cut back to George and Elaine. GEORGE  You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny. ELAINE  No they don't. GEORGE  Ooooh, yes they do. ELAINE  Nooo. GEORGE  Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.  Elaine nods her head in approval. GEORGE  You mean that's true, I'm right?! JERRY  Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.  BABU  Oh, yes, yes, everything wonderful.  JERRY  Ok, I'll see you around the building.  BABU  I'll see you *in* the building. JERRY  Remember Babu Bhatt? GEORGE  Who's he? JERRY  Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday? ELAINE  Yeah, yeah. JERRY  Can you bring my mail then? GEORGE  What mail? ELAINE  I picked up his mail while he was on the road  GEORGE  Why didn't Kramer pick it up? JERRY  Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.  GEORGE  Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?  JERRY  Monday, I think. GEORGE  Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp. JERRY  Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.  George has a dream sequence where the four of them are at a dinner table and Cheryl is laughing hysterically at one of Jerry's jokes. JERRY  ...he never heard of corduroy! CHERYL  Stop it, you're killing me!! JERRY  He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.   Dream sequence ends. GEORGE  No, no I don't think so. ELAINE  Why? GEORGE  Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.  JERRY  I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.  GEORGE  She might not be comfortable. ELAINE  Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.  JERRY  We'll be funny. GEORGE  No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.  ELAINE  Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven. JERRY  No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.  ELAINE  Why? JERRY  No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.   New scene.  George and Cheryl are at Isabella's. GEORGE  Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.  Cheryl laughs. GEORGE  Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.   Just then the headwaiter seats Jerry and Elaine at the next table.  JERRY  Look who's here! Georgie-boy!  What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?  ELAINE  No, I talked him into it. GEORGE  What happened to the auto show? JERRY  Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.  ELAINE  The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.  Jerry and Cheryl laugh, George, unamused, tries pushing Jerry and Elaine away from their table. ELAINE  Hi. GEORGE  Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry. JERRY  Hi, nice to meet you. CHERYL  Would you like to join us? GEORGE  Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.  CHERYL  Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly. ELAINE  Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?  GEORGE  No, no, you can't do that,  they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.  ELAINE  Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--  GEORGE  No! No. ELAINE  No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?  GEORGE  You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything... ELAINE  Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.  CHERYL  Oh? What happened? ELAINE  Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy. CHERYL  Was he Chinese? ELAINE  Yeah. CHERYL  Is your last name Benes? JERRY  How did you know? CHERYL  Ping is my cousin! ELAINE  No! JERRY  That's so funny! CHERYL  I'm handling his case! ELAINE  What? You're Cheryl Fong? CHERYL  That's right!  By now, they're all laughing. ELAINE  Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!  CHERYL  Yeah, I know! ELAINE  Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case? CHERYL  Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.  ELAINE  Tell Ping I said hello. JERRY  Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.   They all laugh as Cheryl walks away. GEORGE  What are you doing? What are you doing?  JERRY  What? GEORGE  This is not good. This is not good.  JERRY  What's the matter? GEORGE  I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.  JERRY  Why not? ELAINE  He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.  JERRY  Biff? GEORGE  What? JERRY  You're not worried about that? GEORGE  No, of course not. JERRY  I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?  ELAINE  He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk   out on his show, go see the other show. JERRY  Well, should we leave? GEORGE  Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny. ELAINE  This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?  JERRY  I don't have to be funny, I don't care.  GEORGE  You don't? JERRY  No way! It's completely under my control.  ELAINE  No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.  JERRY  Of course I can, am I being funny now?  ELAINE  A little. JERRY  Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?  ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  George, is this funny? GEORGE  It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either. ELAINE  What? What did I do?  Cheryl returns. GEORGE  Hi. JERRY  Hello. Welcome back. CHERYL  Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it. ELAINE  Well, nobody likes to get old, right?  JERRY  Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and   how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.  GEORGE  Funny guy, huh?  New scene.  Elaine is bringing Jerry's mail to his apartment. ELAINE  Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.  JERRY  Well thank you very much, it's about time.  ELAINE  Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me. JERRY  Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.  ELAINE  Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.  JERRY  Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.  They hear a noise from the hallway. JERRY  Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!  KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.  KRAMER  Well, the camp ended a few days early.  JERRY  Why? KRAMER  Uh, well there was an incident. JERRY  What happened? KRAMER  I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.  JERRY  What? KRAMER  Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week. ELAINE  You punched who in the mouth? KRAMER  Mickey Mantle. JERRY  What happened? KRAMER  Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate. JERRY  Wow! Joe Pepitone! KRAMER  Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him. JERRY  You plunked him. KRAMER  Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out. JERRY  Wow, this is incredible!  A voice is heard from the hallway. BABU  Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!  JERRY  What's going on out there? BABU  What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad. JERRY  Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.  ELAINE  Yeah, so? KRAMER  Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, \"Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!\" ELAINE  So what'd you do? KRAMER  Well, I got the hell out of there.  JERRY  They took Babu away! ELAINE  They took Babu away?! JERRY  Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame. BABU  Jerry! Jerry! Help me! JERRY  I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!  KRAMER  Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer. JERRY  Uh oh. ELAINE  What? JERRY  Well this is interesting. ELAINE  What is it? JERRY  It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.  KRAMER  Well, doesn't he need that?  New scene.  Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment. JERRY  If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing   never would have happened. ELAINE  Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.  JERRY  Yeah, so am I being funny now? ELAINE  No, actually, you're not being funny now.  JERRY  See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now. GEORGE  No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner. JERRY  Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired. GEORGE  What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.  JERRY  Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.  GEORGE  Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.  JERRY  Ah, will you stop it already? GEORGE  Jerry, please? JERRY  How long is this gonna go on? GEORGE  Till I'm comfortable. JERRY  Well, when is that gonna be? GEORGE  After consummation. JERRY  Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.   New scene.  Jerry and Cheryl are at the coffee shop. CHERYL  I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky. JERRY  That's wonderful news. Thank you. CHERYL  You're a very serious person, aren't you?  JERRY  Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful. CHERYL  I understand.  Jerry reaches for the milk for his coffee. CHERYL  I think it's curdled. JERRY  I don't care. CHERYL  Do you ever laugh? JERRY  Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.  CHERYL  That's so sad. What do you do? JERRY  I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful. ELAINE  Hey, we're gonna go see Babu  now, right? JERRY  Yeah, I'll just pay for this. ELAINE  Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi. CHERYL  Hi. ELAINE  Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop   the case. CHERYL  Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.  ELAINE  You're kidding. CHERYL  No, I'm not.  New scene.  Jerry and Elaine are at the Immigration office. JERRY  Babu! BABU  Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry! JERRY  You remember Elaine. BABU  Yes, yes of course! ELAINE  Nice to meet you. BABU  So nice of you both to come. JERRY  Oh, Babu. BABU  No no, you're both very kind, very kind.  JERRY AND ELAINE  Oh, well, you know. ELAINE  We try. JERRY  We do what we can. ELAINE  We do what we can. BABU  The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it. JERRY  Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows. BABU  Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.  JERRY  Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you   know that little box can get very full. BABU  Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine. JERRY  Oh, I don't want to bother you. BABU  No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man.  JERRY  So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.  BABU  Come again? JERRY  You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.  ELAINE  Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.  BABU  You had my Visa application?! JERRY  Well not technically. BABU  I kill you!! JERRY  Well what about her? BABU  I kill both of you!! JERRY  Babu?! BABU  No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man! JERRY  Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!  BABU  The wheels are in motion? JERRY  The wheels are in motion, things are happening!   New scene.  George and Cheryl are parked. GEORGE  Jerry? CHERYL  I'm very attracted to him. GEORGE  You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny. CHERYL  He never said anything funny. GEORGE  He can't not be funny. CHERYL  No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.  GEORGE  Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.  CHERYL  So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?  GEORGE  Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help. CHERYL  I gotta go. GEORGE  Well, should I call you later? CHERYL  Please don't. GEORGE  But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!  New scene.  Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?  JERRY  I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care of it, he should be back by now. (Answering the buzzer) Yeah?  GEORGE  It's George. JERRY  C'mon up.  They hear a voice in the hallway, Jerry opens the door. JERRY  Babu must be back. BABU'S BROTHER  Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?  JERRY  Where's Babu? BABU'S BROTHER  He is in Pakistan! JERRY  Who are you? BABU'S BROTHER  I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be fixed. JERRY  I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.  BABU'S BROTHER  Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!  ELAINE  Snapple? BABU'S BROTHER  No, too fruity.  Babu's Brother leaves, George enters. JERRY  Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.  GEORGE  She didn't help him? JERRY  No. GEORGE  Where is he? JERRY  He's in Pakistan. GEORGE  Oh boy. JERRY  What do you mean, oh boy? GEORGE  Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth. JERRY  Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.  GEORGE  What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.  JERRY  That's because she had my mail.  Kramer enters. ELAINE  Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp. KRAMER  Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.  JERRY  How could you go in there? KRAMER  Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside! JERRY  Well, what happened? KRAMER  I got down in my knees and went, \"Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!\" ELAINE  So, what did he do? KRAMER  Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me   outside, right into a horse.  There's a knock on Kramer's door. VOICE  Kramer? KRAMER  Yeah? It's my Chinese food.  Ping enters with a bag of food. ELAINE  Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me. PING  Not anymore. ELAINE  What? PING  Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on.  ELAINE  Why? PING  She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby.  Ping exits.  New scene.  Babu and a friend are sitting at a table in an outdoor cafe in Pakistan.  BABU  So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here. BABU'S FRIEND  This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?  BABU  I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.   (Comedy club)  I am for open immigration but that sign we have on the front of the Statue of Liberty, 'Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses...', can't we just say, 'Hey, the door's open, we'll take whoever you got.'? Do we have to specify the wretched refuse? I mean, why don't we just say, 'Give us the unhappy, the sad, the slow, the ugly, people that can't drive, that they have trouble merging, if they can't stay in their lane, if they don't signal, they can't parallel park, if they're sneezing, if they're stuffed up, if they're clogged, if they have bad penmanship, don't return calls, if they have dandruff, food between their teeth, if they have bad credit, if they have no credit, missed a spot shaving, in other words any dysfunctional defective slob that you can somehow cattle prod onto a wagon, send them over, we want 'em.'

GEORGE  Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, \"I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!\"  JERRY  That's funny, that's funny! \"I'm sick of cleaning.\" That's very funny.  GEORGE  I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!  JERRY  Yeah, it's funny! GEORGE  I mean, how funny is this? JERRY  It's funny. GEORGE  I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!  JERRY  It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.  GEORGE  Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.  JERRY  Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.  GEORGE  Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. We should try and get her into this scene.  JERRY  Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters. (Thinks) What does she say...?  GEORGE  I don't know, what do women say? JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.  JERRY  You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.  GEORGE  Alright, forget Elaine. JERRY  Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)  KRAMER  Hey. GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.  JERRY  Who? KRAMER  Your old flame. Gail Cunningham. JERRY  Did you talk to her? KRAMER  Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?  JERRY  So what happened? KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) \"Oh, hi! Kramer!\" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.  JERRY  Yeah, I know about the three dates.  KRAMER  You know what I did? I snubbed her.  JERRY  What do you mean, you snubbed her?  KRAMER  I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.  JERRY  Right by her? KRAMER  Right by her! JERRY  What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. Your loyalty is beyond question.  KRAMER  Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.   New scene - Jerry and Elaine at the coffee shop. Jerry is showing her the script.  ELAINE  I'm not even in here! JERRY  Yeah, I know. ELAINE  I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.  JERRY  Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...  ELAINE  You couldn't \"keep track\" of everybody?  JERRY  Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.  ELAINE  You have no idea? JERRY  Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)  GAIL  I thought I'd find you here. JERRY  Well, Gail Cunningham. ELAINE  Hi, Gail. GAIL  Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?  JERRY  Why? GAIL  He snubbed me. JERRY  Are you sure? GAIL  Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?  JERRY  Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)  ELAINE  I thought you were finished. JERRY  I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?  GAIL  So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?  JERRY  I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.  GAIL  Well, tell him that I am mad at him.  JERRY  Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?  GAIL  Pfeiffer's. JERRY  Ah, the power lunch crowd. GAIL  Nice shoes! ELAINE  Oh. Thank you. GAIL  Where'd you get 'em? ELAINE  They're um, Botticelli's. GAIL  Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.  ELAINE  Really. JERRY  Would you care to join us? GAIL  No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.)  JERRY  See ya. ELAINE  \"Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's.\"  JERRY  That bothered you? ELAINE  Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.  JERRY  It did? ELAINE  Yes! Couldn't you see that? JERRY  No. This is why you're not in the pilot.   New scene - George in a session with Dana, his therapist. DANA  Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.  GEORGE  Yeah, I feel like I've grown. DANA  Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.  GEORGE  Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?  DANA  Yes, yes I did. GEORGE  Well, what'd you think? DANA  Uh...it was...good. GEORGE  You didn't like it? DANA  Well, no, I - GEORGE  I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?  DANA  It wasn't funny. GEORGE  It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?  DANA  No, I didn't find it funny. GEORGE  You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?  DANA  Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.  GEORGE  Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.  DANA  George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.  GEORGE  How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of \"com-med-dee\"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.  DANA  I think you'd better go. GEORGE  Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!   New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. They're both standing by the door. Elaine enters.  GEORGE  So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?  ELAINE  I guess she didn't think it was funny.  GEORGE  Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan &amp; Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!  JERRY  I thought your mother's paying for it.  GEORGE  And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, \"Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.\"  JERRY  You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.  ELAINE  What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)  KRAMER  Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)  JERRY  Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.  ELAINE  Well, you know, I... KRAMER  I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)  JERRY  You what? KRAMER  Yeah, I kissed her. JERRY  You kissed her? KRAMER  Right on the mouth. JERRY  What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?  KRAMER  Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)  JERRY  And what did she do? KRAMER  She kissed me back. JERRY  I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?  KRAMER  Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!  GEORGE  No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)  KRAMER  Ooh, so...I understand you're buying new shoes now at Botticelli's.  ELAINE  What? Who told you that? KRAMER  Gail Cunningham. ELAINE  I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?  KRAMER  Well, you know, we were just talking, and she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.  ELAINE  \"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!\" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)  JERRY  So what? ELAINE  So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)   New scene - Gail cooking in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's Restaurant. Elaine marches in.  ELAINE  Hey! Gail! GAIL  Elaine...! ELAINE  Why are you talking about my shoes?  GAIL  What? ELAINE  My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.  GAIL  What are you talking about? ELAINE  Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)  WAITER  Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?  GAIL  Look Elaine, I am very busy here. ELAINE  Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!  GAIL  I am not discussing this. This is insane.  WAITER  You got that pasta primavera? Let's go! (Gail passes the plate to the waiter in front of Elaine. Elaine sneezes on it. The waiter brings the pasta to the dining room and serves it to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC.) Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.  RUSSELL  Thank you. WAITER  Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.   New scene - Jerry and George arrive at Dalrymple's apartment to discuss the script.  RUSSELL  Well, come in. (They shake hands.) Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.  JERRY  Are you alright? RUSSELL  Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.  JERRY  Where did you eat? RUSSELL  Pfeiffer's. JERRY  Ah. I know the chef there. RUSSELL  Yeah. The food's usually terrific.  GEORGE  My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)  RUSSELL  What are you saying? GEORGE  Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.  RUSSELL  Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.  JERRY  Oh, you have a daughter? RUSSELL  Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.  GEORGE  Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)  RUSSELL  Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)  JERRY  What? RUSSELL  Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)  GEORGE  Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)  JERRY  I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?  GEORGE  Pasta primavera. JERRY  Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'  GEORGE  No! JERRY  Yeah. RUSSELL  Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.  GEORGE  So, you were saying how, um...about the script...  RUSSELL  Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)  GEORGE  More jokes? JERRY  Another ending? GEORGE  A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)  JERRY  Maybe we should go. GEORGE  We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)  RUSSELL  Oh God. Oh my god. JERRY  I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)  MOLLY  Hello. JERRY  Hi. GEORGE  Hi. MOLLY  I'm Molly. JERRY  I'm Jerry. GEORGE  George. JERRY  We're here discussing our script with your father.  GEORGE  He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)  MOLLY  Daddy? Are you okay? RUSSELL  Yeah, sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)  GEORGE  So, you live with your mother, huh?  MOLLY  Uh, yeah. GEORGE  Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid. Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)  MOLLY  Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?  RUSSELL  It's just a stomach thing. MOLLY  Yuck. RUSSELL  We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)  GEORGE  You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)  RUSSELL  Get a good look, Costanza?  New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. JERRY  What were you doing? GEORGE  Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!  JERRY  You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.  GEORGE  It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.  JERRY  Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.  GEORGE  All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.  JERRY  That's why I poked. GEORGE  That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)  GAIL  Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?  JERRY  What? GAIL  She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.  KRAMER  Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.  GAIL  I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)  GEORGE  Pasta primavera? JERRY  Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)  KRAMER  She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.  JERRY  She is? KRAMER  She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)  JERRY  Hello? Oh, hi Stu. GEORGE  From NBC? JERRY  Yeah. What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)   Commercial break.  New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. JERRY  If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.  ELAINE  Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!  GEORGE  He poked me! JERRY  There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...  ELAINE  But she was fifteen. JERRY  You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.  GEORGE  Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...  JERRY  You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.  GEORGE  Hey, now you're onto something. JERRY  The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.  GEORGE  Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine, but...somebody like Gail, though.  ELAINE  What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)  KRAMER  Yah-hey. JERRY  Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.  KRAMER  Alright, I'll call her right now. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)  ELAINE  What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?  JERRY  Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)  KRAMER  She said she'll do it. JERRY  Beautiful. KRAMER  But she wants the shoes. ELAINE  What? KRAMER  She says she wants those shoes. ELAINE  She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!  JERRY  No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!  ELAINE  No, these were the last pair of these that they had!  JERRY  I'll get you another one just like it!  ELAINE  No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)  GEORGE  Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...  ELAINE  Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -  GEORGE  Never mind! ELAINE  Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?  KRAMER  Alright, what size are you? ELAINE  Seven-and-a-half. KRAMER  Eh! Bingo.  New scene - Gail in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's. She notices Dalrymple being shown to his table.  GAIL  Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)   Continuation of last scene - Russell eating at the restaurant. Jerry and George arrive. Jerry hands the shoes to Gail, and they walk over to Russell's table.  JERRY  Hey! Whattaya know! GEORGE  Look who's here! JERRY  Fancy meeting you here! RUSSELL  Oh. Hello. GEORGE  Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.  JERRY  You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.  GEORGE  Didn't hear anything... JERRY  Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.  RUSSELL  It just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?  GEORGE  Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?  JERRY  No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)  ELAINE  Excuse me, are you using that ketchup?  RUSSELL  Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)  GEORGE  Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)  RUSSELL  Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)  ELAINE  Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?  RUSSELL  No. ELAINE  Do you have a...ketchup secret? RUSSELL  No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)  ELAINE  Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)  RUSSELL  Field of vision, huh?  Commercial break.  New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine having dinner at Pfeiffer's. Gail comes over to the table.  GAIL  How's everything? ELAINE  Mmmm. JERRY  Really good. GEORGE  This pasta primavera is fabulous. JERRY  Very tasty. GAIL  How'd everything go with that NBC guy?  GEORGE  Great. JERRY  The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?  ELAINE  You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.  JERRY  Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.  ELAINE  Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.  GEORGE  Well, it's a funny idea. JERRY  It's funny! GEORGE  C'mon, funny is funny. JERRY  Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?  ELAINE  Well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.  JERRY  If you can. GEORGE  Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?  ELAINE  Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)  JERRY  I think what he's trying to say is, \"get the bouilla-base.\" (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)

That's all you've done, as far as I can tell. Now those astrology   things where they tell you all the people that have the same birthday as   you? It's always an odd group of people too, isn't it? It's like Ed   Asner, Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.  (George dropping off his date for the night) ALLISON  I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!  GEORGE  Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because   of me? I'm nothing! ALLISON  No... You're *something*. GEORGE  You can do better than me.

(Elaine and George exchange thoughts on what they got Jerry for his birthday)   GEORGE  I got two tickets to see \"Guys And Dolls\".  ELAINE  I got him a two-line phone.  (Jerry returns to the booth and explains the phone call.) JERRY  Unbelievable! She's not there. GEORGE  What paper does she write for? JERRY  The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in   journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has   no idea who I am. ELAINE  Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...  JERRY  Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...  ELAINE  (Proudly) Really? ELAINE  Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?  JERRY  Living or all time? ELAINE  All time. JERRY  Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends   with Brezhnev. ELAINE  I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?  GEORGE  Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.  ELAINE  I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.  ELAINE  Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you   should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.  GEORGE  So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.  JERRY  (indignantly) What's the matter with you?  GEORGE  (quietly) C'mon, go along... JERRY  I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose-  STEPPING PAST ME  \"C'mon Jerry, go along, go along...\"  JERRY  Y'know I hear that all the time. ELAINE  Hear what? JERRY  That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.  ELAINE  Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.  JERRY  Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.  ELAINE  And you get along well with women.  GEORGE  I guess that leaves me in the clear...    GEORGE  I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno   actor. JERRY  Oh yeah, what? \"Buck Naked\"? GEORGE  Yeah, how did you know that? JERRY  You told me that already like two months ago.  GEORGE  Allison bought it for me. JERRY  How you gonna get out of *that* one?  GEORGE  I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.  JERRY  He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?  SHARON  Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.  GEORGE  Jerry did you wash this pear? JERRY  Yeah, I washed it. GEORGE  It looks like it hasn't been washed.  JERRY  So *wash* *it*. GEORGE  You hear the way he talks to me? SHARON  You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me...  GEROGE  Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?  SHARON  It's nice. GEORGE  Jerry said he didn't like it. JERRY  I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...  GEORGE  No, you said you didn't like it...  JERRY  Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or   something? SHARON  So how did you two meet? JERRY  Actually, we met in the gym locker room.  GEORGE  Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes   and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and   then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever   since. SHARON  Do you guys live together? JERRY  (quizzically) Live together? GEORGE  No, I got my own place. SHARON  And do your parents know? JERRY  Know *what*? GEORGE  My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...    JERRY  Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on   us. I *knew* you looked familiar! JERRY  There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing   for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my   friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that   there's anything wrong with that... GEORGE  No, of course not... JERRY  I mean that's fine if that's who you are...  GEORGE  Absolutely... JERRY  I mean I have many gay friends... GEORGE  My *father* is gay... SHARON  Look, I know what I heard. JERRY  It was a *joke*... GEORGE  Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right   now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon! KRAMER  Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!  GEORGE  No! JERRY  No steam! KRAMER  Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!  KRAMER  Happy birthday paruba! JERRY  Today's not my birthday. KRAMER  Well, I beg to differ... JERRY  Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!  JERRY  Hey, where you going? ELAINE  I gotta go return something... SHARON  Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not   going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry. JERRY  Thank you very much, that's great- )click( Oh! Hold on a sec, I got   a call on the other line. )click click( Hello? GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on   the other line. GEORGE  So, what did she say? JERRY  She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She   thinks we're heterosexual. (sarcastically) I guess we *fooled* her.   I'll get rid of her, hold on... )click click( Sharon? Hello? Sharon,   are you there? )click click( I'm back... GEORGE  Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...  JERRY  What are you talkin' about? GEORGE  I heard what you said: \"Sharon, are you there?\".  JERRY  You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?  GEORGE  Yes, I heard you! JERRY  Well, maybe she was disconnected. GEORGE  Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!  JERRY  Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything,   hold on. )click click click(... KRAMER  Yello? JERRY  Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. )click click(  GEORGE  \"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on\"!  JERRY  Oh no! )click click( Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!  GEORGE  \"The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye\"!  JERRY  Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?  GEORGE  Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...  JERRY  No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are   nobody's business but their own! SHARON  Why don't you take a seat? ELAINE  Thank-you. SHARON  Why don't you take your coat off? ELAINE  So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she   forcibly tried to get me to remove it. JERRY  She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.  GEORGE  Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on   in somebody's house, the families go to war! JERRY  So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay.   Not that there's anything wrong with that... GEORGE  Not at all. GEORGE  Two tickets to \"Guys And Dolls\"! I'm gonna go with you!  JERRY  \"Guys And Dolls\"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?  GEORGE  It's \"Guys And *Dolls*\", not \"Guys And *Guys*\".  JERRY  \"The Collected Works Of Bette Midler\".  JERRY  What do you got there? MAN #1  _The New York Post_, they've got an article about you.  JERRY  \"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his   long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable...\" Oh no! The Associated   Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper!   I've been \"outed\"! I wasn't even \"in\"! GEORGE  Now everyone's going to think we're gay!  JERRY  Not that there's anything wrong with that...  GEORGE  No, not at all... 54) JERRY  \"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and   Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old   married couple--\" *I told you that pear was washed*! KRAMER  I thought we were friends... JERRY  Here we go... KRAMER  I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?  JERRY  It's not true! KRAMER  Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the   masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single... JERRY  So are you... KRAMER  Yeah-- GEORGE  Hello? MRS. S  George? GEORGE  Mrs. Seinfeld?!? MRS. S  Oh, my God... JERRY  Oh, my God! (takes the phone) Ma? MRS. S  Jerry? JERRY  Ma! GEORGE  Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!! MRS. S  Jerry? JERRY  Ma, it's not true! MR. S  It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!  MRS. S  They weren't culottes, they were shorts.  MR. S  They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.  MRS. S  By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!  MR. S  It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud!  JERRY  Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!  MRS. S  Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry.  MRS. C  I open up the paper, and *this* is what I have to read about? I fell   right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move...   The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked!  GEROGE  It's *not* *true*! MRS. C  Every *day* it's something else with you. I don't know anything about   you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who   knows *what* you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films.  GEORGE  Yeah. I'm Buck Naked. MRS. C  Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything   wrong with it. GEORGE  Of course not... NURSE  6:30, Scott. Time for your sponge bath.    GEORGE  Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner   first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre? SAILOR  Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to   know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that   you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a   discharge from the service. Thanks. JERRY  Y'know, I think I'll pass on the \"Guys And Dolls\"...  GEORGE  No. Just imagine her reaction. ELAINE  Yeah... GEORGE  Oh, my God... JERRY  What? GEORGE  She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think--   *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!! ALLISON  Yeah? So? GEORGE  Yeah so?? ALLISON  Well this is nice. They mention your name.  GEORGE  Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's   implying? ALLISON  No, what? GEORGE  I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.  ALLISON  You're *gay*? GEORGE  Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.  ALLISON  (matter-of-factly) I don't believe it.  GEORGE  You don't believe me? Ask Jerry. ALLISON  I will. GEORGE  What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very   private person. ALLISON  (Grabs George's lapels) I want to hear it from *Jerry*...  11) SHARON  Oh, can you ever forgive me? JERRY  I dunno... (they kiss again) *Alright*, I forgive you...  SHARON  Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.  JERRY  I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.  GEORGE  Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!  JERRY  What!? GEORGE  You're with a *woman*! JERRY  I know! What are you doin' here?!?  GEORGE  I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I   trusted you! JERRY  (forcibly removing G. from the apt) Would you get the Hell out of   here! SHARON  What's going on? ALLISON  Yeah, what's going on? GEORGE  Alright, tell her. Go ahead. JERRY  Tell her what? GEORGE  Y'know. About *us*.   GEORGE  Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked,   I'm a porno actor. ALLISON  *Really*? KRAMER  We'll see you later... KRAMER  He's the *phone* man! KRAMER  Not that there's anything wrong with that...   (Comedy club) JERRY  I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when   someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that   is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy   and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate   the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay   community. They're probably discriminated against because of that,   people say to them \"Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think   think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt   in and lost the wife\". But if people are even going to assume that   think Joe might be a little... (waves hand back and forth)\", they should  VACUUM  \"Y'know I think Joe might be )vroom( (makes vacuuming motion).   Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little )vrooom(...\"   THE END>",

Why can't I act with the ones I   like the same way I do with the ones I don't like? JERRY  Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll   *all* be over... GEORGE  Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.  JERRY  Yeah, how about a mute? GEORGE  A mute would be good. JERRY  Ah, where you gonna meet a mute? GEORGE  This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.  GEORGE  I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry,   there's a void... JERRY  A deep, yawning chasm... GEORGE  There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?  JERRY  Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on   top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure. ELAINE  Hey boys! JERRY  Hey! How you doin'? ELAINE  Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.  GEORGE  Start what? ELAINE  I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.  GEORGE  *Really*. ELAINE  Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so*   *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I   haven't even met the woman yet. GEORGE  Volunteer work, huh? JERRY  What're you gonna do down there? ELAINE  Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and,   I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and   it's supposed to make them feel good. JERRY  That's what I do with him (points at George)  GEORGE  When did you get this idea? ELAINE  Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on*   and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak   English. JERRY  What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?  GEORGE  And... and anybody can do this? ELAINE  Yup. GEORGE  Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense!   How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!  ELAINE  (To Jerry) What about you? JERRY  Nah, it's not for me. ELAINE  Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.  GEORGE  What *kind* of a person are you? JERRY  I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.  AGENCY REP  This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful   just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that  everyone who participates finds the experience extremely  rewarding. GEORGE  Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.  AGENCY REP  Good luck. JERRY  Thank you. GEORGE  Hey, what's your guy's name again?  JERRY  Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your   guy? GEORGE  Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?  JERRY  *We*? No. KRAMER  So what's up, Diggity Dog? JERRY  George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer   Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing. KRAMER  Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.  JERRY  What're you talkin' about? KRAMER  Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!  JERRY  What? KRAMER  It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money   laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of   their life savings, oh *yeah*. JERRY  Where do you *get* this? KRAMER  The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.  NEWMAN  Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?  KRAMER  I'm in here. C'mon... JERRY  Hello, *Newman*... NEWMAN  Jerry, George. (To Kramer) So, did you ask him about the records?  KRAMER  Well-- JERRY  What records? KRAMER  Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.  NEWMAN  You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used   records! KRAMER  Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-   fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around-- KRAMER  Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.  GEORGE  Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?  NEWMAN  I'm a United States postal worker.  GEORGE  Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a   gun and shoot everybody? NEWMAN  Sometimes... JERRY  Why *is* that? NEWMAN  Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and   coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it   piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the   more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar   code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!  RON  I'll give you five bucks. KRAMER  Five bucks??? NEWMAN  Well, you know how much those records are worth!?  RON  Yeah, I do... Fi' dollars. NEWMAN  Those records are worth more than five dollars!  KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) He's gyppin' us...  NEWMAN  You're gyppin' us! RON  Well, whattya got here, y'know, you got \"Don Ho: Live At Honolulu\",   you got \"Jerry Vale Sings Italian Love Songs\" you got Sergio Mendes,   now come on... KRAMER  Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.  NEWMAN  They follow him like a cult. KRAMER  He can't even walk down the street in South America...  RON  Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad.  KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) I don't like it...  NEWMAN  I don't like it. RON  Well, then get the Hell out of my store, alright? You bring me   something decent, I'll give you some money. KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) Alright, well be back, jack.  NEWMAN  Alright, well be back... *jack*! JERRY  Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.  HOUSEKEEPER  Agency? JERRY  Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?  HOUSEKEEPER  Sid Fields. SID  What the *Hell* is it? JERRY  Mr. Fields? SID  What!?! JERRY  Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.  SID  Agency? What agency? The *CIA*? JERRY  No, no, the-- SID  Who let you in here? JERRY  The woman, she-- SID  Oh *her*. She *steals* from me. Steals my money. She says she   doesn't speak English. My *ass* she doesn't speak English. Plays   that freakin' \"voo-doo\" music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks   she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well,   I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell   wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house... JERRY  Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.  SID  Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend.   Are you going to *kill* me? I'm an old man for crying out loud,   you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!? (Jerry gets out card)  JERRY  No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm-- SID  I can't read that you fool... JERRY  What's all this stuff? SID  Trash. Garbage. JERRY  You're throwin' this out?? SID  I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.  JERRY  You don't want any of this? SID  Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, *Ein-stein*.  JERRY  You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.  SID  Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family.  JERRY  Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...  SID  With you? I'd rather be dead. JERRY  Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an   appointment to get my, um, tonsils out. SID  Good. Thank God. Good riddance. (pause)   Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!!  BEN  No, I feel great for 85. GEORGE  Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72.   You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there. BEN  I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.  GEORGE  You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my   age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All   I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...  BEN  I'm grateful for every moment I have.  GEORGE  Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the   end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be   over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the   wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake... BEN  I guess I just don't care. GEORGE  What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in   the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any   *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile   that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?! GEORGE  Wait a second, where are you going?  BEN  Life's too short to waste on you. GEORGE  Wait a minute, please-- BEN  Get out of my way... GEORGE  But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...  ELAINE  Mrs. Oliver? MRS. O  Yes my dear. ELAINE  Ooh! MRS. O  What's the trouble? Are you alright?  ELAINE  Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. MRS. O  It's my goiter, isn't it? ELAINE  Did you say goiter? What goiter? MRS. O  This football-shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck.  ELAINE  Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...  MRS. O  Does it bother you? ELAINE  Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that   bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um,   in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you   want to know something? I, I wish I had one. (pause) Really.   (END Act I) JERRY  C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...  ELAINE  I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the   face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start   talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send  YOU OVER THERE  \"Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second   head\". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information. JERRY  They really should mention that in the breakdown: height, weight,   goiter. ELAINE  Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but   this is too much to ask. JERRY  Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice   disposition than the nut they sent me to. ELAINE  Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?  GEORGE  I don't think it's gonna work out...  JERRY  Whattya mean? GEORGE  He fired me. JERRY  He fired you?!? ELAINE  *How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?  GEORGE  I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!  JERRY  Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy.   He's a mean, mean guy. ELAINE  I wish I could quit... JERRY  So quit! GEORGE  Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well.   I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my   grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up. KRAMER  Well, here's your *albums* (Journey \"Escape\" is on top, BTW...)  JERRY  What happened? NEWMAN  Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.  KRAMER  Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me   at that store. NEWMAN  That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.  JERRY  Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...  KRAMER  Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in   South America! JERRY  Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was   Jolson, Benny Goodman... KRAMER  Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??  JERRY  Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he   said yeah.  Kramer Okay... NEWMAN  (In Kramer's ear) The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!  KRAMER  Yeah... JERRY  But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them   all. KRAMER  Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.  JERRY  Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house   keeper he's got. She's from Senegal (and, ala Carson) Wild, Wild,   Stuff... GEORGE  Senegal? GEORGE  So you don't speak *any* English at all?  HOUSEKEEPER  English? No. SID  Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?  JERRY  Well you said they could come and take the records.  SID  It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage.  GEORGE  You don't speak *any* English? HOUSEKEEPER  No English. GEORGE  I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over   your body.  (No reaction) You don't understand! It's a miracle! You  don't understand because you don't speak English! JERRY  So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--  SID  Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums   outta here. KRAMER  Now calm down, Mr. Fields... SID  Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you   little... KRAMER  Oooow! He's biting me! SID  My teeth! My teeth! JERRY  Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!  GEORGE  I thought I saw something fly over here...  JERRY  Well turn the light on... JERRY  That's the garbage disposal! SID  My teeth! You idiots!!! MRS. O  And we would take long automobile trips--  ELAINE  Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...  MRS. O  Staring out the window-- ELAINE  Uh huh... MRS. O  You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and--  ELAINE  Well, that'll get you goin' right there...  MRS. O  Big, roaming cows-- ELAINE  Cows, well that's fascinating... MRS. O  That's when I began my affair with Mohandas.  ELAINE  What? MRS. O  Mohandas. ELAINE  Ghandhi? MRS. O  Oh, the *passion*. The *forbidden pleasure*--  ELAINE  You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O  He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body.   Here, look... (shows Elaine a picture of the two together) ELAINE  Oh, my God... The Mohatma? RON  Twenty bucks. NEWMAN  Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?  RON  Well, take it or leave it. NEWMAN  Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!  RON  Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her   you sing \"Mammy\". Heh heh heh... KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...  NEWMAN  You are nothing but a piece of crap.  RON  Pardon me? KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) A piece of crap...  NEWMAN  A piece of crap. KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) I find you extremely ugly...  NEWMAN  I find you extremely ugly. RON  *Do* you? KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...  NEWMAN  You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.  RON  Oh, is that right? KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) I *loathe* you...  NEWMAN  I *loathe* you. RON  That's it. Get out of my store! KRAMER  (In Newman's ear) Make us. NEWMAN  Make us! RON  Oh, I'll make you! AGENCY REP  Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole   purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop   you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation. JERRY  Yes, but-- JERRY  (Into intercom) Yes? TIM  It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son. JERRY  Alright, c'mon up. JERRY  (To Rep) I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take   him to the dentist. AGENCY REP  Why were you taking him to the dentist?  JERRY  Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage   disposal-- AGENCY REP  What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal?  JERRY  Well, after he bit my friend-- AGENCY REP  Bit your friend?! TIM  What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human   being?! JERRY  I, I'm sorry. TIM  And who were these other people. What were they doing in the   apartment!? JERRY  Well, I brought them up there to take his records--  TIM  Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record   collection is? KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  There you are. Did you find him? KRAMER  No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he   tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight. NEWMAN  It was a real melee. KRAMER  Yeah, a real brouhaha...

        "text": "    THE IMPLANT Written by  Peter Mehlman   (Comedy club)  The cosmetic surgery procedures that are available to people today - liposuction, are you familiar with this? This is a fat-sucking machine. Now you know, somewhere, somebody is working on a way that this thing could go into a restaurant. And you could just order it off the menu. 'I tell you what, give me the cheesecake, crank me up to nine, and put a scoop of ice cream on the side.'   Opening scene - Sidra on a Stairmaster at the New York Health Club. Jerry enters after his workout w/gymbag in hand.  SIDRA  Oh, hi Jerry. JERRY  Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.  SIDRA  Really. JERRY  Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.  SIDRA  Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.  JERRY  Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?  SIDRA  Thursday night. JERRY  Alright.  Elaine walks over to Jerry. ELAINE  Good workout? JERRY  Tremendous workout. ELAINE  That's a pretty girl. JERRY  Tremendous girl. ELAINE  She's the one you went out with last night?  JERRY  Yeah. I really like her. ELAINE  You know, uh...they're fake. JERRY  What? Don't say that! ELAINE  Nah! They're fake! JERRY  How do you know? ELAINE  I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?  JERRY  I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)  ELAINE  Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?  JERRY  Yes, they do! ELAINE  I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.  JERRY  A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?  ELAINE  No. JERRY  Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.  ELAINE  I don't want to see her naked. JERRY  Well, I do. ELAINE  Well, that's your problem. JERRY  Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.  ELAINE  Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?  JERRY  Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!  ELAINE  But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!  JERRY  Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.  ELAINE  What's his problem? JERRY  Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.  ELAINE  Wrong side? JERRY  Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.  ELAINE  He can't go left. JERRY  No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?  ELAINE  Nah, we just play defense.  New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats him to it.  GEORGE  Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?  BETSY  Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people.  GEORGE  I'll shout. BETSY  Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.  GEORGE  C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?  BETSY  What? (The phone rings.) GEORGE  No, no, the machine'll get it... BETSY  No, no, it's not on... GEORGE  They'll call back. BETSY  But George, what if it's an emergency?  GEORGE  In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?  BETSY  George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god!  GEORGE  Alright, maybe four.  New scene - Elaine at the health club, in the sauna with Sidra and some other women. We hear her thoughts.  ELAINE'S BRAIN  Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.   Cut back to George and Betsy at her apartment. Betsy's still on the phone.  BETSY  So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.)   New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. JERRY  You're sure? ELAINE  Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.  JERRY  Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.  ELAINE  What? Just 'cause of that? JERRY  Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!  ELAINE  Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?  JERRY  You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.  ELAINE  You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?  JERRY  Well, I take it very seriously. ELAINE  You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.   (Kramer enters.) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.  KRAMER  Well, I know what they feel like. JERRY  You? How do you know? KRAMER  Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.  ELAINE  I thought you hated Los Angeles. KRAMER  I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.  JERRY  Real busy now down at the office? KRAMER  No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.  ELAINE  Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.   New scene - Jerry, George and Kramer in the sauna at the health club.  GEORGE  I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.  JERRY  You put her on a pedestal. KRAMER  I put them on a dental chair. JERRY  He puts 'em on a dental chair. GEORGE  I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.  KRAMER  Whoo. It's like a sauna in here. GEORGE  That's funny. You're a funny guy. JERRY  Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?  GEORGE  Why, you think I should? JERRY  What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!  GEORGE  I'm the consolation guy...? KRAMER  Consolation Guy is big. JERRY  Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.  KRAMER  It's like ten dates in one shot. JERRY  This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!  GEORGE  It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.  KRAMER  Why don't you get a \"death in the family\" fare?  GEORGE  What? GEORGE  Really? KRAMER  In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!   (George considers.)  New scene - Elaine in the sauna again. We hear her thoughts.  ELAINE'S BRAIN  Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.   (Sidra enters the sauna with a friend.) ELAINE'S BRAIN  Ah, look who's here. \"Silicon Valley.\"  SIDRA  So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.  ELAINE  Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.  SIDRA  Oh, that's o.k. ELAINE  Did he give you a reason? SIDRA  Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.  ELAINE  Really? SIDRA  He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.  ELAINE  Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?  SIDRA  Yes! How did you know? ELAINE  Oh, I know the type. SIDRA  So you can relate? ELAINE  Oh, yeah. SIDRA  You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.  ELAINE  Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls \"right into them.\")   Commercial break.  New scene - Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.  JERRY  You fell on her? ELAINE  I touched 'em. JERRY  You what? ELAINE  I...touched...'em. JERRY  You touched 'em?! ELAINE  I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!  JERRY  Wow. ELAINE  Anyway...they're real. JERRY  Excuse me?! ELAINE  I think they might be real. JERRY  Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.  ELAINE  I've touched mine! JERRY  So have I. ELAINE  Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles) JERRY  Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.  ELAINE  Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.  JERRY  Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)   New scene - George and Kramer at the airline ticket counter. Kramer is pretending to be grief-stricken.  GEORGE  You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.  CLERK  Oh, I'm very sorry. KRAMER  I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...  CLERK  You poor thing! KRAMER  I...I... GEORGE  You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.  CLERK  You're a good friend. CLERK  Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.  GEORGE  The death certificate? CLERK  Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.  GEORGE  What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?  CLERK  I know! But it happens. GEORGE  You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?  CLERK  That would be $387 round-trip. KRAMER  Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?  CLERK  Yes.  Cut back to Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. JERRY  I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!  ELAINE  Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.  JERRY  But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?  ELAINE  I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!  JERRY  Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.   (Kramer enters.) KRAMER  Hey! JERRY  Hey. George off to Detroit? KRAMER  Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.  ELAINE  Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.  KRAMER  Pffft - wrong.  New scene - Kramer and Jerry at the health club. They see \"Salman Rushdie\" talking to Sidra.  JERRY  There's Sidra. KRAMER  There's Salman. JERRY  Where? KRAMER  Talkin' to that woman. JERRY  Talkin' to Sidra? KRAMER  If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.  JERRY  I don't think that's Salman. KRAMER  Well, I don't think they're real. JERRY  If that's Rushdie, they're real. KRAMER  If they're real, that's Rushdie. JERRY  Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.  KRAMER  I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.   New scene - Kramer and \"Salman\" sitting in the sauna together.  KRAMER  It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.  \"SALMAN\"  You've lived in the desert? KRAMER  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?  \"SALMAN\"  Yes, I've been there. KRAMER  My name's Kramer. \"SALMAN\"  Sal Bass. Pleased to meet you, Kramer.  KRAMER  So, uh...what kind of work do you do?  \"SALMAN\"  I'm a writer.  New scene - George and Betsy at Aunt Clarice's wake in Detroit.  BETSY  Have you met my boyfriend George? AUNT MAY  No! (shakes George's hand.) BETSY  George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend, George.  AUNT MAY  Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way.  GEORGE  Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.  AUNT MAY  Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?  BETSY  I'm not very hungry. AUNT MAY  They have some very nice snacks. FATHER JESSUP  I'm about to get myself a snack.  (Betsy starts to go for a snack.) GEORGE  Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.   (George goes into the other room and meets Father Jessup.) FATHER JESSUP  This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.  GEORGE  Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)  FATHER JESSUP  You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative.  GEORGE  Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?   New scene - Jerry and Kramer entering Jerry's apartment after returning from the health club.  KRAMER  C'mon Jerry! JERRY  Oh, how can you be so sure? KRAMER  Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!  JERRY  Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!  KRAMER  Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!  JERRY  Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...  KRAMER  What, did you ask her? JERRY  I'm gonna find out tonight. KRAMER  Oh, yes indeed...  Cut back to George at the wake in Detroit. DR. ALLENWOOD  Why do you need a death certificate?  GEORGE  Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.  DR. ALLENWOOD  Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it.  GEORGE  Oh, that would be wonderful. DR. ALLENWOOD  It was very nice meeting you, George.  GEORGE  Likewise.  (George walks over to the snack table as Timmy watches him from across the room. He takes a chip from the bowl, dips it, takes a bite, and then dips again. Timmy hurriedly comes over.)  TIMMY  What are you doing? GEORGE  What? TIMMY  Did...did you just double-dip that chip?  GEORGE  Excuse me? TIMMY  You double-dipped the chip! GEORGE  \"Double-dipped\"? What are you talking about?  TIMMY  You dipped the chip. You took a bite. (points at the dip) And you dipped again.  GEORGE  So...? TIMMY  That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!  GEORGE  Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)  TIMMY  Oh, you don't, huh? GEORGE  No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)  TIMMY  Gimme the chip! (Grabs George and the chip goes flying.) Gimme the chip! (They struggle in front of the snack table.)   New scene - Night-time; Jerry and Sidra in Jerry's apartment.  SIDRA  I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)  JERRY  Hey, would you mind switching seats?  SIDRA  Why? JERRY  Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.  SIDRA  O.K....(they switch places.) JERRY  How ya doin'? SIDRA  Good. How you doin'? JERRY  Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.  SIDRA  I hear that's how she died. JERRY  Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.  SIDRA  Well, a lot of women are having them done.  JERRY  Really? SIDRA  Yeah. JERRY  How do you like that. SIDRA  A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.  JERRY  Aw, you know people. SIDRA  It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.  JERRY  Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.  SIDRA  What do you tell them? JERRY  Whatever you want me to tell them.  SIDRA  Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?  JERRY  No. SIDRA  What if it's an emergency? JERRY  Oh, there's no emergency... KRAMER  Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency! JERRY  Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!  KRAMER  Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.  JERRY  This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?  KRAMER  Well, I like yours. JERRY  I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.  KRAMER  C'mon, what's wrong with my boys? JERRY  Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.  KRAMER  Alright, c'mon! JERRY  Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)  ELAINE  Hi, Jer. JERRY  Oh, hi, Elaine. ELAINE  Oh...hi, Sidra - SIDRA  Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.)  JERRY  What are you doing here? ELAINE  I'm looking for Kramer. KRAMER  Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?  JERRY  Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?  SIDRA  I was just leaving. JERRY  Right, you were leaving. SIDRA  I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.  JERRY  That was an accident! SIDRA  I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)   Cut back to an exterior shot of the funeral home in Detroit. We hear the commotion of George and Timmy fighting.  BETSY  Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!  DR. ALLENWOOD  Go back to New York! Get out!  New scene of a disheveled George at the airport in Detroit, talking to Clerk no. 2.  CLERK 2  Alright sir, now all I need is a death certificate and you'll be on your way.  GEORGE  Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)  CLERK 2  What's this? GEORGE  That's a picture of me next to the coffin.   (We see a photo of George standing next to a coffin.) CLERK 2  Nice try. GEORGE  Not even close, huh? THE END>",

And you   can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment.   So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about   committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once   you commit, then you can commit the adultery and then you get caught,   get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know   some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating   with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning   to the robber next to you and goin' \"Alright, gimme everything you   have, too\".  GEORGE  You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?  JERRY  Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and   shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.  GEORGE  So when're you gonna see her? JERRY  Tonight. GEORGE  What's her name? JERRY  I... don't... know... GEORGE  How could you not know her name? JERRY  I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do   with a car, or a fish... JERRY  Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...  GEORGE  Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the   State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school   back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the   Lincoln Savings Bank. JERRY  Yeah, I did that too. GEORGE  You remember the, the little bank book, there?  JERRY  Sure. GEORGE  Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I   completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks   me down. The interest has accumulated to 1 900 dollars. 1 900   dollars! They're sending me a cheque! JERRY  Wow! GEORGE  Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without   doing anything... JERRY  Y'know I have friends who try to base their whole life on that   principle. GEORGE  Really? Who? JERRY  Nobody you know... GEORGE  Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...  JERRY  Why don't you put it in the *bank*?  GEORGE  The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna   make a big score! JERRY  *Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...  GEORGE  What's with the gloves? KRAMER  Well, I'm staining my floors and, y'know, I don't want to get my   hands dirty... GEORGE  What, the whole apartment? KRAMER  The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm   gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin.   'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry (Snaps fingers)... Wood.  JERRY  What, you rented \"Home Alone\"? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  I thought you saw that already... GEORGE  No, I saw \"Home Alone II\". JERRY  Oh, right... But you *hated* it! GEORGE  Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, do you   mind if I watch it here? JERRY  What for? JERRY  Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing   anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing   something. KRAMER  I can't work with these! JERRY  What's wrong? KRAMER  Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...  JERRY  You said \"gloves\"... KRAMER  No, no, these are too thick. KRAMER  Oooh, is that \"Home Alone\"? GEORGE  Yeah. The *original*. ELAINE  Hey Boys-O! ELAINE  Remember Roy, the artist? JERRY  Right, the \"triangle\" guy. ELAINE  Exactly, the \"triangle\" guy. JERRY  Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?  ELAINE  Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was just a little too...  JERRY  Artsy? ELAINE  Fat. JERRY  Oh. ELAINE  He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare. Anyway,   he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go   visit him. ELAINE  Listen, Jerry can you do me a favour? Could you go into the room   with me to visit him because I don't want him to think that I'm,   y'know... interested. JERRY  Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.  ELAINE  Well... JERRY  Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before   to some critical acclaim. ELAINE  What's with him? JERRY  Y'know a lot of people have asked that...  ELAINE  Roy! ROY  *Elaine*! What a *surprise*. ELAINE  Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognise you! You look so...  ROY  I've lost some weight... ELAINE  A *lot* of weight. ROY  I know. ELAINE  You look ter*rific*. ROY  Thank you. So do you. ELAINE  This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.  ROY  Thank you. JERRY  Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. WOMAN  Waaaaaaaaa! KRAMER  Ah, the mother lode! ELAINE  I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't   even get my arms around you... ROY  Yes, I remember. ELAINE  Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose   weight. ROY  Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.  ROY  After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for   weeks. ELAINE  *Get* *out*! ROY  Really, it's the truth. ELAINE  Jerry, did you hear that? He couldn't eat for weeks...  JERRY  That's terrible... ELAINE  I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.  ROY  You did. JERRY  You know I can't get this damn thing to sleep...  ELAINE  Now listen, tell me something. When are you gettin out of here?  ROY  Next Thursday. ELAINE  Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for   a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin... JERRY  Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?  ELAINE  No that's the week after. JERRY  No, I believe it's next week. ELAINE  You're wrong. JERRY  No I'm not... ELAINE  Shut up... KRAMER  Pay dirt! ELAINE  Uh Roy, this is Kramer-- he's one of our friends.  ROY  How do you do? KRAMER  I do great. DOCTOR  Hi Roy. ROY  Oh, hey Dr. Siegel. JERRY  Hey Doc, check this out. (does an around-the-world) I *just*   learned that. DOCTOR  I just wanted to stop by to see if you had any questions about   tomorrow's operation. KRAMER  Yeah, I have a question. What do you know about inter-abdominal   retractors? DOCTOR  Are you asking because you saw \"20/20\" last night?  KRAMER  I sure am. DOCTOR  Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor   and I can assure you we do not use that kind type of retractor in   your friend's procedure. KRAMER  But you *will* use... a retractor.  DOCTOR  We have to... KRAMER  Mmm-hmm... DOCTOR  Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's   welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's  operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it   with them? KRAMER  I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!  JERRY  I dunno... KRAMER  Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut   him open. His guts'll be all over the place... JERRY  Yeah, that's true... KRAMER  ...They'll saw through bone. (makes saw noises while gesturing over   Roy's chest) You'll see what's *inside* bone... JERRY  Hey. GEORGE  Hi... JERRY  What are doing, you crying?? GEORGE  No... JERRY  You crying from \"Home Alone\"?? GEORGE  The old man got to me. JERRY  Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends   with you anymore after this display GEORGE  Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway?  JERRY  Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves and wanted   to get home and start working on his floor. GEORGE  How's the guy? JERRY  Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting pretty chummy.   Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. GEORGE  That's nerve... JERRY  Yeah, so she and \"Triangle Boy\" can go out to fancy restaurants.  GEORGE  Y'know what it is? It's \"Clara Nightingale Syndrome\". He falls   ill; she falls in love. JERRY  You mean Florence Nightingale. GEORGE  What'd I say? Clara? JERRY  Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton.  GEORGE  Clara Barton? What did she do? JERRY  I'm not sure, but I think she was nice.  GEORGE  Susan B. Anthony I think I'd have a problem with.  JERRY  Yeah, I think you would. GEORGE  So, you gonna buy his art? JERRY  No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1 900 dollars.  GEORGE  Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here.   Have fun with what's-her-name. JERRY  I will. GEORGE  Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.  JERRY  No, it isn't. I can find out. GEORGE  Yeah? How? JERRY  There are ways. JERRY  Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun   of my name like you wouldn't believe-- \"Jerry Jerry Dingleberry\",   \"Seinsmelled\"... WOMAN  \"Seinsmelled\"? JERRY  Yeah. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?  WOMAN  Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your   name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy? Of course, not   everybody can be as sweet as you are. WOMAN  Oh, Jerry... JERRY  Oh... *you*... GEORGE  Now let's try \"breast\"... Celeste... Kest...  JERRY  No. GEORGE  Rest... Sest... Hest... JERRY  \"Hest\"? That's not a name. GEORGE  What, you should've just asked her.  JERRY  I know, I should've asked her. GEORGE  What're you gonna do now? JERRY  I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once   you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name. GEORGE  Aretha! JERRY  No... GEORGE  Bovary! JERRY  Alright, that's enough. GEORGE  Alright, well you know what you gotta do, you gotta go through her   purse. Y'know, the credit cards, driver's license... JERRY  How am I gonna do that? GEORGE  When she goes to the bathroom. KRAMER  Ah, there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys   go to the operation with me? JERRY  You asked a date to go to the operation?  KRAMER  Yeah... So c'mon, what d'you say? GEORGE  What kind of operation is it? KRAMER  Spleenectomy. GEORGE  Isn't that where they remove the--  KRAMER  Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet!  KRAMER  C'mon, what d'you say? GEORGE  Mulva! JERRY  Mulva? KRAMER  C'mon, do you wanna go? JERRY  Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll go   watch them slice this fat bastard up. DOCTOR  Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal   organs. Nurse-- retractor. JERRY  What are you eating? KRAMER  Junior Mints. Do you want one? JERRY  No... KRAMER  I can't see... Psst.... JERRY  Where'd you get those? KRAMER  The machine. You want one? Here, take one.  JERRY  I don't want any! KRAMER  No, they're good! JERRY  I don't want any! KRAMER  Just take one. JERRY  No! Kramer, stop it! 30) JERRY  ...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the   patient! GEORGE  What do you mean \"into the patient\"?  JERRY  Into the patient, *literally*! GEORGE  Into the hole? JERRY  Yes, the hole! GEORGE  Didn't they notice it? JERRY  No! GEORGE  How could they not notice it?!? JERRY  Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.  GEORGE  What did they do? JERRY  They sealed him up with the mint inside.  GEORGE  They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?  JERRY  Yes! GEORGE  I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.  JERRY  They *eat* them, they don't put them next to vital organs in their   abdominal cavity! KRAMER  Hey, this wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski   lodge! JERRY  Why did you force that mint on me? I didn't want the mint!  KRAMER  Well, I didn't believe you. JERRY  How could you not believe me?!? KRAMER  Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's   peppermint-- it's *delicious*! JERRY  That's true. KRAMER  It's very refreshing! JERRY  Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...  ELAINE  Prognosis... negative. JERRY  Prognosis *negative*!? ELAINE  He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're   baffled. J+K  Oh, my God... ELAINE  Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive.   Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really   lift his spirits. GEORGE  It's that bleak? ELAINE  Mmm... GEORGE  Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...  JERRY  We gotta confess. KRAMER  Really? JERRY  Yes! KRAMER  We could be tried for murder... JERRY  I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb!  KRAMER  You're not gonna say anything, you got that?  JERRY  I'm telling and you can't stop me!  KRAMER  You're *not*!!! GEORGE  Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1 900 dollars worth.  JERRY  Oh yeah, that's the spot... WOMAN  What're you so tense about? JERRY  Oh, nothing really... Just a homicide. (She finds the right spot   on his back) Oh that's terrific... Mulva. WOMAN  What? JERRY  Mulva? WOMAN  Mulva? JERRY  My Aunt's name is Mulva. She's a masseuse.  WOMAN  I'm going to the bathroom. Be right back.  JERRY  Oh, good idea... WOMAN  What are you doing? JERRY  Oh, I was just looking for some... gum or... mint.  WOMAN  Oh, I have Junior Mints. JERRY  No! (throws her purse back at her) No, I mean, no thank you...  KRAMER  Any news? JERRY  (whispering) No, you better get out of here. No, wait a second...   Wait a second... I don't know the name of this woman in the   bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then   she'll be forced to say her name. KRAMER  10-4. WOMAN  Oh, hello. KRAMER  Hello, I'm Kramer. WOMAN  Nice to meet you. KRAMER  See you later. (He leaves) WOMAN  Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play.   Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage   and meet Olympia Dukakis. JERRY  Hey, there's a name you don't forget.  WOMAN  Oh, hi. GEORGE  Hi, I'm George. WOMAN  Nice to meet you, George. GEORGE  I gave it a shot... So, any word on the \"artiste\"?  JERRY  No, I haven't heard anything. GEORGE  Well, I got my triangles. JERRY  Really... GEORGE  Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.  JERRY  Yeah, I'm sure... JERRY  Well, I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.  GEORGE  No, Jerry. I wouldn't do that. JERRY  Why? GEORGE  You could get in trouble. JERRY  Look, I gotta try and help the guy.  GEORGE  Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number   is up, who are you to interfere!? JERRY  Yes I'd like to speak to Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's   condition... GEORGE  What? What? JERRY  Oh, thats *fantastic*! GEORGE  He didn't get better, did he? JERRY  Thank you very much. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!  GEORGE  Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1 900 dollars down the drain.  ROY  You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me   to get better. I'll never forget what you did for me. GEORGE  Oh, that's great. That's great. KRAMER  Y'know, art is a great investment.  ELAINE  It's gonna look great in your apartment, George.  GEORGE  Yes I look forward to many years of looking at the triangles.   Well, I'll wait for you outside. ROY  Hey, George... (kiss) DOCTOR  Y'know I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in   your recovery, but I think there were other factors at play here.  JERRY  What do you mean? DOCTOR  I have no medical evidence to back me up, but something happened   during the operation that staved off that infection. Something   beyond science. Something perhaps from above... KRAMER  Mint? DOCTOR  Those can be very refreshing. ROY  So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday?  ELAINE  I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we're going to the Poconos on   Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerry (the boyfriend)) JERRY  I don't think so... ELAINE  We are... JERRY  I believe we're not... ELAINE  (Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Please can we go to   the Poconos? JERRY  Well, I'll think about it... WOMAN  Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.  JERRY  Really... WOMAN  And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my   playbill. JERRY  Oh, what're you saying, you got her autograph?  WOMAN  Yeah. JERRY  Do you have it with you? WOMAN  Yeah, it's in my purse. JERRY  Let me see. WOMAN  Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.  WOMAN  Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... (reads autograph)   ...Joseph Puglia... WOMAN  I had it autographed for my uncle.  JERRY  Yeah, I know... WOMAN  You don't know my name, do you? JERRY  Yes I do. WOMAN  What is it? JERRY  It, uh, rhymes with a female body part.  WOMAN  What is it? JERRY  Mulva... JERRY  Gipple? JERRY  Loleola? JERRY  Oh! Oh! *Delores*! 15) JERRY  Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else.   Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of   getting more candy. And you have your favourite candies that you   love. \"I love those... I hate those...\". \"I hate those... I   love those...\". And only a seven year old kid can taste the   difference between a red M&amp;M and a light brown M&amp;M. Two totally   different things when you're seven years old. \"Well, your red is   more of a main course M&amp;M, but the brown is more of a mellower   flavour; it's an after dinner M&amp;M, really\".

How about the   doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell  YOU SOMETHING  if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a   date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too.   You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either. JERRY  Is that bothering you? ELAINE  No, not at all... ELAINE  Oh, could you please hurry? JERRY  (mockingly) \"Please hurry\". Look at you. Look at what you've   become. ELAINE  What? What have I become? I haven't \"become\" anything...  JERRY  Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?  ELAINE  I don't want to keep him waiting...  JERRY  He'll like you more... ELAINE  That's impossible... WIFE  Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?  HUSBAND  Leave me alone. JERRY  Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...  JERRY  So, where am I dropping you? ELAINE  His place... JERRY  This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop   you off at his apartment... ELAINE  *And* he gets the rest of my chicken...  JERRY  So, is tonight \"the night\"? ELAINE  You never know... JERRY  Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*! JERRY  Boy, do you smell something? ELAINE  Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I   smell something. JERRY  What is it? ELAINE  I think it's B.O.! JERRY  What? ELAINE  It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.  JERRY  It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.  ELAINE  Jerry. It's *B*.*O*. JERRY  But the whole car smells. ELAINE  So? JERRY  So when somebody has B.O., the \"O\" usually stays with the \"B\".   Once the \"B\" leaves, the \"O\" goes with it.   ELAINE  I can't believe you ski! CARL  I'm a great skier. ELAINE  Yeah? What else? CARL  Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...  ELAINE  (delightedly) Oh! You \"pillage and plunder\"?  CARL  ...When I travel. ELAINE  See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and   plunders! I'm so lucky.   GEORGE  This'll only take a second. KRAMER  Yeah, I'm going to poke around... GEORGE  (to himself) Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian*   sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is   that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...  GEORGE  (to himself) Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?  SUSAN  George? GEORGE  (to himself) Argh! (to Susan) Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are   you doing here?! SUSAN  Renting a video! What do you got there?  GEORGE  Oh, ... some stupid movie... SUSAN  This is Mona. GEORGE  Oh, hi... MONA  Pleasure to meet you. GEORGE  Yes. Well... MONA  Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.  SUSAN  You okay? GEORGE  Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.  SUSAN  And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.  GEORGE  Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I   think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation!   I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?  SUSAN  I *know* who I'm talking to. GEORGE  Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh,   that, uh... SUSAN  I liked women? GEORGE  There you go. GEORGE  So, uh, how long has this been going on?  SUSAN  Since you and I broke up. GEORGE  Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?  SUSAN  Yeah. GEORGE  Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very   nice. SUSAN  So, what have you got there? GEORGE  Oh, I, uh-- SUSAN  Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle'' GEORGE  It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.  SUSAN  Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?  GEORGE  No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity.   It's... *sidal* nudity... CLERK  Next. GEORGE  Oh, that's me. SUSAN  Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.  GEORGE  Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the   whole thing, there. CLERK  Uh, what are you returning? GEORGE  (embarrassed pause) ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.  CLERK  Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... \"A young girl's strange, erotic   journey from Milan to Minsk\"... CLERK  Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49. GEORGE  $3.49? It says $1.49. CLERK  Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not   rewinding. GEORGE  What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!  KRAMER  George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to   keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't   give him the satisfaction. GEORGE  I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...  JERRY  So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I   figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve   hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the   *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained*   strength throughout the night... ELAINE  Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that   I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car. JERRY  What about skunk? ELAINE  I don't mind skunk. JERRY  Horse manure? ELAINE  I *loooove* horse manure. JERRY  Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I   went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get   the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my  responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now,   and *demand* they pay for it. ELAINE  Absolutely. ELAINE  Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he   tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean? JERRY  It means he's lying. ELAINE  Wow... JERRY  Why? Is that what he told you? ELAINE  Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some   time... JERRY  No. Never. ELAINE  Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.  JERRY  Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will   *always* trade sleep for sex. ELAINE  Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?  JERRY  Anything's *possible*... JERRY  What's the matter with you? KRAMER  Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...  JERRY  Oh yeah, Steinbrenner... KRAMER  I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll   just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with   Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff... JERRY  I know the list... KRAMER  What's that smell? JERRY  What smell? KRAMER  Ooooh... You stink. JERRY  Whatd'ya mean I stink? KRAMER  You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?  JERRY  I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in   the car! ELAINE  So? JERRY  Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me!   It's alive! ELAINE  If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl   said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I   have B.O.! Me! KRAMER  What happened? JERRY  What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's   destroying the lives of everyone in it's path. GEORGE  What is that? B.O.? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  This is *unbelievable* B.O. JERRY  I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me   in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like   it. GEORGE  So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?  JERRY  No, no. It's the valet guy. GEORGE  No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.  JERRY  Oh... No, that's ridiculous. GEORGE  What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?  JERRY  Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism. GEORGE  The woman she's \"lesbianing\" with? Susan told me she's *never*   been with a guy. GEORGE  Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!  JERRY  There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a \"Smell   Gestapo\". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a   big, soapy brush... GEORGE  Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing   now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I   never would've broken up with her. JERRY  Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...  JERRY  Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window)   No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!  RESTAURATEUR  What do you mean-- \"stunk up\"? JERRY  I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?  GEORGE  Stinks. JERRY  Stinks! RESTAURATEUR  Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour...  JERRY  Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!  RESTAURATEUR  Really? Well, I smell you now. JERRY  That's from the car! RESTAURATEUR  Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather   than the car stinking up you! GEORGE  Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...  JERRY  Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car;   see which smells worse. RESTAURATEUR  I don't have time to smell cars. GEORGE  Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the   source... JERRY  You've gotta smell the car RESTAURATEUR  I'm a busy man JERRY  C'mon! One whiff! RESTAURATEUR  Alright, one whiff... RESTAURATEUR  Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you   let me out! JERRY  Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?  RESTAURATEUR  Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!  RESTAURATEUR  I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven   dollars... (sarcastically) \"...erotic journey from Milan to   Minsk\"... CARL  The valet had such bad B.O.?  ELAINE: OH, MAN, JUST *RAMPANT*, MUTANT B.O. THE \"O\" WENT FROM THE   valet's \"B\", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry   thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...  CARL  That's a relief... ELAINE  What? CARL  It's still there... ELAINE  No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!  GEORGE  Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I   was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis. CLERK  That'll be $98.00. GEORGE  What $98.00? CLERK  That's what I said. $98.00. GEORGE  How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?  GEORGE  So, was it me? SUSAN  Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me   about? (Gives him the $35) Here. GEORGE  Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.  SUSAN  Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go. GEORGE  Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever   to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take   turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work? SUSAN  You're an idiot. GEORGE  Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.  SUSAN  I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.  GEORGE  It's not me! It's the car! MONA  I didn't think I'd come. KRAMER  I knew you would. MONA  Oh, Kramer! CAR WASHER  We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the   spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure   compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining   liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in   your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.  JERRY  Let's do it. HAIRDRESSER  The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the   five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine,   and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and  condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted   vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that  doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce. ELAINE  Tomato Sauce? JERRY  Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!  CARL  It still smells. JERRY  It still smells! GEORGE  How could it still smell after all that?  JERRY  I don't know! GEORGE  Well, what are you gonna do? JERRY  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!  GEORGE  You're *selling* the car!? JERRY  You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more   powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be   helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can   get for it. GEORGE  Maybe I'll buy it. JERRY  Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This   is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!  ELAINE  I still smell! JERRY  You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's   the beast! SUSAN  Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!  JERRY  Susan! SUSAN  Kramer! JERRY  What is going on? SUSAN  You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns   down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.  GEORGE  He stole your girlfriend? SUSAN  Yes. She's in *love* with him. GEORGE  Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.  JERRY  That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...  ELAINE  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second.   I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her   *entire* life-- KRAMER  I'm Kramer. GEORGE  I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?  SUSAN  I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.  GEORGE  Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other   girls... SUSAN  You think so? GEORGE  Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.  SUSAN  You're very sweet... GEORGE  Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I   gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that   woman, I can't get you out of my mind. SUSAN  Really? GEORGE  Yeah, you're just so... hip. GEORGE  Oh, my God... SUSAN  What? GEORGE  It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.  ALLISON  George? GEORGE  Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?  ALLISON  Good. You know, you owe me $50... GEORGE  Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan,   Allison. ALLISON  Nice to meet you... SUSAN  Nice to meet you... ALLISON  That's a beautiful vest... SUSAN  Thank you... KRAMER  I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment;   it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the   atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.  SALESMAN  What year did you say this was? JERRY  '90. KRAMER  Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she   tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early. JERRY  That's strange... SALESMAN  How many miles you got on this thing?  JERRY  23 000. KRAMER  And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm   wearing *your* jacket... JERRY  Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!  SALESMAN  I can't sell this car.  JERRY: THIS... THING... HAS GOT TO BE STOPPED! HAIRDRESSER  So, what do you want to do? ELAINE  Sauce me.   JERRY  Why do we need B.O.? What is the function of it? Everything in   nature has a reason, has a purpose, except B.O. Doesn't make any   sense-- do something good, hard work, exercise, smell very bad.   This is the way the human being is designed. You move, you stink.   Why can't our bodies help us? Why can't sweat smell good? It'd be   a different world, wouldn't it? Instead of putting your laundry in   the hamper, you'd put it in a vase. You'd go down to the drugstore   and pick up some odourant and perspirant. You'd probably have a   dirty sweat sock hanging from the rear-view mirror of your car.   And then on a really special night, maybe a little underwear comin'   out of your breast pocket. Just to let her know she's important.      THE END>",

        "text": "  THE HANDICAP SPOT Written by   Larry David   (At the comedy club) JERRY  I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful  ABOUT DIVORCE  you get impeached and you're not even the president!   (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else? ELAINE  We don't walk that fast... GEORGE  No seriously... ELAINE  Seriously, we don't. GEORGE  The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.  ELAINE  (Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews! JERRY  What's the big hurry? ELAINE  Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?  JERRY  Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.  GEORGE  I gotta buy a present now? ELAINE  Of course you do, it's an engagement party.  GEORGE  It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake. JERRY  You don't like the Drake? GEORGE  Hate the Drake. ELAINE  I *love* the Drake. JERRY  How could you not like the Drake? GEORGE  Who's the Drake? ELAINE  \"Who's the Drake\"? JERRY  The Drake is good! ELAINE  So listen, what are you gonna get him?  GEORGE  I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)  JERRY  Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!  ELAINE  So what? That's easy. JERRY  Easy?  (Kramer enters in his usual way) ELAINE  Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?  KRAMER  Uh, no, no, not yet. JERRY  Do you like the Drake? KRAMER  I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!  ELAINE  I'm lukewarm about the Drakette. KRAMER  (Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...  JERRY  It's Isosceles KRAMER  Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles.   Isosceles Kramer. ELAINE  Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.  JERRY  The chip-in! ELAINE  Hey, a pretty good idea, huh? JERRY  Yeah! KRAMER  Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely! JERRY  You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room. KRAMER  No, no! My car's not running.  (George enters the room from the washroom) JERRY  What about your father's car? GEORGE  No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.  JERRY  Are you serious? GEORGE  You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.  JERRY  How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car! GEORGE  Good thinking! JERRY  Good to meet you!  (George's car) ELAINE  So what are we gonna get him? JERRY  We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.  GEORGE  I like this area. I could live out here.  KRAMER  Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.  JERRY  Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now. GEORGE  Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?  MAN IN CAR  No! KRAMER  Why don't you take a handicap spot...  GEORGE  You think? ELAINE  No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.  GEORGE  I don't want to walk that far. ELAINE  What if a handicapped person needs it?  KRAMER  Oh, come on, they don't drive! JERRY  Yes, they do! KRAMER  Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?  JERRY  Well there's spaces there, they must drive!  KRAMER  Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.  ELAINE  So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?  GEORGE  Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the \"party\"!  KRAMER  I got news for you: handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.  GEORGE  He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?  ELAINE  What does that mean? GEORGE  Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in. KRAMER  Yeah, go ahead. ELAINE  George! GEORGE  Oh, come on, it's five minutes.  (pulls into handicap spot) KRAMER  Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.   (walking in the parking garage) JERRY  Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?  ELAINE  What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's... GEORGE  What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums... JERRY  No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!  ELAINE  Got to *love* the Drake!  (sound of police cars) JERRY  Hey, what's going on over here? ELAINE  Must have been an accident...  (they turn the corner so they can see their car, surrounded by a lot of people)  JERRY  (to a woman) Hey, what's going on?  WOMAN  Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's... JERRY  Is she OK? WOMAN  I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay! JERRY  Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.  (man hits George's car in rage) GEORGE  How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!  ELAINE  (to George) Are you happy now? KRAMER  Who would think these people we're gonna be here?  JERRY  I don't know... ELAINE  What about the party? What about the Drake?  GEORGE  Screw the Drake! JERRY  I love the Drake! KRAMER  Let's just take a bus back to the city.  GEORGE  Can't leave the car here! KRAMER  Why not? GEORGE  It's my father's car! EVERYBODY  Yeah! Yeah! JERRY  Let's get out of here.  (coffee shop) GEORGE  What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?  JERRY  The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us? ELAINE  Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?  JERRY  What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying... GEORGE  What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands! KRAMER  You'd think... GEORGE  I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?  KRAMER  Most of them don't even have batteries.  GEORGE  Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy. KRAMER  Yeah... GEORGE  Well, I'm sorry! ELAINE  Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...  GEORGE  How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!  JERRY  I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.  ELAINE  Me? JERRY  Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!  ELAINE  Oh, they won't? JERRY  Not if they don't know you... ELAINE  I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!  KRAMER  No chance in hell! JERRY  What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started  SCREAMING  \"There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!\" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car! GEORGE  That's good, we'll give it a try...  ELAINE  That's good... JERRY  That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!  KRAMER  Huh?  (parking garage)  (the four of them approach George's car, which is smashed to pieces)  JERRY  (as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...  (George's parents' house) FRANK  Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!   (Estelle is playing Mahjongh with the ladies) FRANK  A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!  GEORGE  Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed! ESTELLE  (to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!  FRANK  (to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!  MAHJONGH LADY  Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!  FRANK  No it isn't! MAHJONGH LADY  So what are you doing now, Georgie?  GEORGE  I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...  FRANK  Where the hell is my paper? MAHJONGH LADY  You're writing a pilot? ESTELLE  With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...  MAHJONGH LADY  So what's it about? GEORGE  Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be Jerry's butler. MAJONGH LADIES  This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler!   (giggling) ESTELLE  Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!  GEORGE  Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...  ESTELLE  He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...  (Estelle wins at Mahjongh)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry's on the phone with the Drake, Elaine is eating an Oreo cookie)  JERRY  (to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it! ELAINE  Oh, yeah... JERRY  (to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat? ELAINE  Sure! JERRY  (to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye... JERRY  The Drake is great! ELAINE  Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.  JERRY  Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.  (buzzer rings) JERRY  Yes? GEORGE  It's me. JERRY  Come on up.  (Door opens, Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.  JERRY  St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why? KRAMER  Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.  ELAINE  You went to see her? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  Wow, what happened? KRAMER  I'm in love. JERRY  What? KRAMER  Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking. JERRY  Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.   (George enters) KRAMER  Ah, I'm glad you're here. GEORGE  What? KRAMER  Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.  GEORGE  A wheelchair? What for? KRAMER  Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one! GEORGE  Doesn't she have collision? KRAMER  George, I'm in love with her! GEORGE  Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.  KRAMER  No! She needs it now! GEORGE  What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?  KRAMER  Well... ELAINE  Hey, we told you not to park there!  GEORGE  Can't we just fix the old one? KRAMER  Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?  GEORGE  Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!  (at Surgical Appliances) SALESMAN  This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped. KRAMER  So now, what's this got? SALESMAN  Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine. GEORGE  How much? SALESMAN  6200. GEORGE  Do you have something a little more... less expensive?   (At the Drake's)  (The Drake opens the door, the Drakette is sitting on the couch)  JERRY AND ELAINE  Hey Drake! Hi Drake! JERRY  Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!  ELAINE  My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?  THE DRAKE  Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic...   (Jerry sits down next to Alison) JERRY  I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....  ELAINE  Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?  JERRY  So where're we eatin'? THE DRAKE  Well, actually... Jerry... ELAINE  I'm *really* hungry! THE DRAKE  ... we just broke up... JERRY  When did this happen? THE DRAKE  About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... whew!  JERRY  Look at the picture on this thing...  ELAINE  Oh, cristal clear! JERRY  They know how to make 'em...  (The Drake starts sobbing) ELAINE  Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?  THE DRAKE  Gagliano's... that's pretty good...  JERRY  Well... we should... ELAINE  Get movin'... JERRY  Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.  ELAINE  Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!  (The Drake is sobbing again, Elaine takes the remote control out the door then returns)  ELAINE  Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...   (at Surgical Appliances) SALESMAN  Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat.  KRAMER  But this'll get you around? SALESMAN  Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.  GEORGE  Like what? SALESMAN  For example, your tremor-damping. KRAMER  Now what's that? SALESMAN  It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.  KRAMER  Well, is it alright if I try it? SALESMAN  Hop in!  (Kramer sits down, and likes it) KRAMER  Oh yeah!  (Salesman is laughing) SALESMAN  I tell ya...  (Kramer crashes into wheelchairs while trying to control his)  SALESMAN  When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place. GEORGE  How much?  (Kramer crashes into some more wheelchairs) SALESMAN  How about $240? GEORGE &amp; KRAMER  We'll take it!  (Jerry's appartment) ELAINE  Drake gave her the TV? JERRY  He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.  ELAINE  Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!  JERRY  I know it is! ELAINE  Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!  JERRY  I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again. ELAINE  They don't know anybody in Chicago.  JERRY  Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.   (George enters) GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.  GEORGE  The Drake broke up?! That's fantastic! Now we get the TV back! It'll help defray   some of the cost of the wheelchair. JERRY  I don't know about defraying. GEORGE  Why? JERRY  We're not gettin' that TV. GEORGE  What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.  ELAINE  The Drakette took it. GEORGE  She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours. ELAINE  Well, she has it! GEORGE  I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!  GEORGE  Maybe we should call her. ELAINE  Well, who's gonna call? JERRY  You are. ELAINE  What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?  JERRY  Because that's your thing! ELAINE  What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my \"thing\"? JERRY  Yeah, that's your thing. ELAINE  Alright, gimme the phone... it's my \"thing\"...   (Elaine starts dialling) JERRY  You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.  GEORGE  Really? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  I could see that... Hello? ELAINE  Alison! Hi, this is Elaine... I gave all the gifts to charity. ELAINE  Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...  I hate the Drake. ELAINE  Everybody does. Bye-bye....  (Elaine hangs up the phone) ELAINE  She gave it to charity. JERRY  Charity?!? That's apalling. GEORGE  How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah! GEORGE  You mean a blessing in disguise? KRAMER  Yeah....  (At George's parents' place) LADY  And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month!  (applause) LADY  Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. That's a lot of wheelchairs!   (applause, door bel rings) LADY  On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you!   (Estelle opens the front door, two men walk in) FRANK  Well... thank you very much! COP  Mr. Costanza? FRANK  Yes? COP  You're under arrest. FRANK  Under arrest? What for? COP  Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.  FRANK  What's that? COP  Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...  FRANK  George! George!  (Jerry's appartment) JERRY  Your father got arrested? For what?  GEORGE  Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat. JERRY  Ho-ly! GEORGE  Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back... JERRY  So what are you gonna do? GEORGE  I agreed to become his butler. JERRY  What?  (Kramer enters) JERRY  What's the matter? KRAMER  It's over! JERRY  What's over? KRAMER  Me and Lola.... GEORGE  The woman we bought the wheelchair for?  KRAMER  Yeah, she dumped me! JERRY  She dumped you? KRAMER  She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?  JERRY &amp; GEORGE  ... no... KRAMER  Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful? GEORGE  ...you're very attractive... KRAMER  yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!  JERRY  Drop dead? GEORGE  Boy, even I never heard that one...  JERRY  She's pretty rough! KRAMER  Yeesh-jip! GEORGE  Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.  JERRY  240 bucks? GEORGE  Well, it was slightly used... JERRY  Used?  (cut to Lola rolling down a hill trying to use her brakes that don't work, screaming)   (George's parents' place)  (George's vaccuuming) FRANK  I don't think you did such a good job on these...   (George turns off the vaccuum) GEORGE  What!? FRANK  You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?   (Phone rings) FRANK  Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!  (hangs up the phone) FRANK  George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes. GEORGE  Sons of bitches! FRANK  Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.  GEORGE  Big screen TV? FRANK  Do you think you can handle it?  (At the Drakette's)  (knock on door, the Drakette opens) ALISON  Yes? GEORGE  Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.  ALISON  Oh great, it's right over there. KRAMER  Ooh, it's a big one!  {All four inside a delivery van outside the mall) GEORGE  Who's got the receipt? ELAINE  I do. GEORGE  Will they give us cash? JERRY  That's their policy. GEORGE  I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...  KRAMER  Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?  GEORGE  What if there is a fire? KRAMER  What are the chances of that? THE END>",

Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go: \"Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch.\" According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.   (Jerry's)  (Jerry is entering his apartment, following by Kramer) KRAMER  Why can't I play Kramer? JERRY  Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!  KRAMER  Neither are you. JERRY  I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?  KRAMER  Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.  JERRY  My grandmother's in the hospital. KRAMER  Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!  JERRY  This is real believable. KRAMER  What you didn't think I was really laughing?  JERRY  It stinks. KRAMER  Let me see you do it. JERRY  Say something funny. KRAMER  Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.  JERRY  Ah.......... KRAMER  Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)   (George enters while they're both laughing) GEORGE  Why are two pretending to be laughing?  JERRY  We're acting. (they stop laughing)  GEORGE  Oh, real good. (George makes a face like: you stink) Any word from NBC?  JERRY  No. GEORGE  I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.  KRAMER  (to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.  JERRY  (to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.  KRAMER  (to George) Yeah! GEORGE  Out of the question. KRAMER  Oughh! GEORGE  (to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like: he doesn't know)   (scene ends)  (Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant)  (Elaine and Russell are sitting down at a table) RUSSELL  I really appreciate you coming. ELAINE  Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...  RUSSELL  All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once...  ELAINE  That was two months ago. RUSSELL  Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)  ELAINE  Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)  RUSSELL  But I want you. ELAINE  God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).  RUSSELL  Is it something I said... or did? ELAINE  Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.  RUSSELL  Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.  ELAINE  Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that \"Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?\" guy.  RUSSELL  Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.  ELAINE  Really? What is it about? RUSSELL  (a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.  ELAINE  (surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?  RUSSELL  (starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?  ELAINE  Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.  RUSSELL  There's a show. that's a show. ELAINE  Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...  RUSSELL  (stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.  ELAINE  I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).   (scene ends)  (Jerry's)  (back to when we left earlier with Jerry, Kramer and George. Jerry is answering the phone while Kramer is about to go back into his apartment)  JERRY  Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.  GEORGE  He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)   (Kramer sits down and starts to talk on the phone) JERRY  (to George) Again with the sweat pants?  GEORGE  What? I'm comfortable. JERRY  You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world: \"I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable.\" (George is baffled)  KRAMER  (to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)  JERRY  (to Kramer) Who is it? KRAMER  That's NBC. JERRY  NBC!?! Give me the phone! KRAMER  I'm in the middle of a conversation here.  JERRY  Get off the phone! KRAMER  (to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)  JERRY  You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?  KRAMER  Russell Dalrimple's secretary. JERRY  All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4:00. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)   (scene ends)  (Dana's office) GEORGE  What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?  DANA  That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.  GEORGE  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.  DANA  I thought you didn't believe in God?  GEORGE  I do for the bad things. DANA  Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?  GEORGE  What? DANA  It's like a discoloration. It's white.  GEORGE  (gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.  DANA  You'd better get that checked out.  GEORGE  Better get that checked out? DANA  I would. GEORGE  What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?  DANA  I'm trying to help you. GEORGE  What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)  DANA  I think you'd better go. GEORGE  Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)   (scene ends)  (Jerry and George in a cab at a light) JERRY  Where? GEORGE  Right here. (showing his lip) JERRY  Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')  GEORGE  (to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?  CABBIE  Yeah, it's like a discoloration. GEORGE  Oh, my God. CABBIE  Yeah, it's all white. GEORGE  (to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!  JERRY  Would you stop? CABBIE  I would get that checked out if I were you.  GEORGE  Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.  JERRY  If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.  GEORGE  Catch what in time? JERRY  Whatever it is. GEORGE  You think it's something? CABBIE  Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car (he starts his wipers)  JOE DEVOLA  (through the opened window's cab) Good luck on the pilot Jerry. (the cab pulls away)   (scene ends)  (NBC)  (Stu and Jay are sitting. George is standing in front of them, asking about his lip. The Casting Director, a woman, is sitting across from them on a couch. Jerry is in the back, standing and looking through the window. There's a box of raisins on the coffee table.)  STU  (to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.  GEORGE  (to Jay) What do you think it is? JAY  It's like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers)  CASTING DIRECTOR  O.K. guys, are we ready to start? JERRY  Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.   (George sits down next to Stu and Jay, and grabs a magazine and the box of raisins. Jerry walks over to Goerge and sits next to him.)  STU  Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.  JAY  He must be worried about the fall schedule.  STU  Ah, it's a real bear. GEORGE  Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?  STU  Yeah. Right.  (the casting director enters with an actor) CASTING DIRECTOR  This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. (the guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair)  MARK  Hey how you doing? JERRY  (thinking) They've gotta be kidding.  GEORGE  (thinking) This guy's perfect. CASTING DIRECTOR  O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.  MARK  Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny)  CASTING DIRECTOR  No. Why? MARK  Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say: \"Vandelay Industries\".  CASTING DIRECTOR  I'm Vandelay Industries? MARK  Right. CASTING DIRECTOR  What is that? MARK  You're in latex. CASTING DIRECTOR  What do I do with latex? MARK  I don't know, you manufacture it.  (scene cuts)  (the casting director enters with another actor) CASTING DIRECTOR  This is Michael Barth. Another George. (he's in sweat pants, bald, with glasses)  ALL  Hi Michael. How you doing? JERRY  Everything all right? MICHAEL  I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)  CASTING DIRECTOR  Any questions? MICHAEL  Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?  GEORGE  No, not a loser! CASTING DIRECTOR  Let's start with the second scene. You have it here?  MICHAEL  A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)  CASTING DIRECTOR  So? MICHAEL  Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...  CASTING DIRECTOR  He was what? MICHAEL  He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)  CASTING DIRECTOR  That's a massage. MICHAEL  I think it moved.  (scene cuts)  (the casting director enters with a beautiful actress) CASTING DIRECTOR  This is Melissa Shannon. MELISSA  Hi. ALL  Hi. How you doing. CASTING DIRECTOR  Melissa is reading for Elaine. MELISSA  It's like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas.  JERRY  No you didn't. He knows he's bald.  MELISSA  So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table)  CASTING DIRECTOR  O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down)  JERRY  (getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.  MELISSA  Oh, great.  (the casting director leaves the chair to Jerry. Jerry sits in front of Melissa and slides the chair very close to her)  JERRY  Alright, want to start? MELISSA  Yeah. JERRY  O.K. MELISSA  Ahem. What was that look? JERRY  What look? MELISSA  That look you just gave me? JERRY  I gave a look? MELISSA  Yes. GEORGE  Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)  CASTING DIRECTOR  Let's see some more Kramers.  (We see many short scenes with a wide variety of fat, tall, or small actors opening the door like Kramer does. Finally enters Tom Pepper, the guy that will get the role of Kramer)  ALL  Hi. How you doing? TOM  (to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing?  JERRY  (smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.   (scene cuts)  (Tom and the casting director are into a scene) CASTING DIRECTOR  What is this about? TOM  (standing) Levels. CASTING DIRECTOR  Levels? TOM  Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt.  CASTING DIRECTOR  I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?  TOM  Oh! I'll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table)  GEORGE  Very nice JERRY  Very good GEORGE  Very nice Tom, that was terrific. TOM  May I? (pointing the box of raisins)  GEORGE  Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)  JERRY  (to George) It was a wonderful reading.  GEORGE  Yeah. Really. TOM  Well, bye. GEORGE  Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)  STU  Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.  JERRY  Yeah, I liked him. GEORGE  What happened to the raisins? JAY  Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!  GEORGE  Did he just steal the raisins? STU  You think he stole them? CASTING DIRECTOR  (enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand.  JERRY  (to Kramer) What are you doing here?  CASTING DIRECTOR  You two know each other? STU  Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.  KRAMER  That's true.  (Jerry and George look at each other. They're gonna let Kramer have a shot at it. Kramer unfold the script and smile at Jerry and George, very confident.)  KRAMER  (acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?  STU  I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.  KRAMER  Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)  \"Sorry buddy, full house.\" We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant: \"Sorry, customers only\" ...running into a movie theater: \"Hey you need a ticket!\" ...running through the park...)   (scene ends)  (Monk's)  (Jerry and Elaine at a booth) ELAINE  So who's playing Elaine? JERRY  Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.  ELAINE  Really? JERRY  Yes. ELAINE  Who is it? JERRY  She's an eskimo, actually. ELAINE  Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)  JERRY  She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.  ELAINE  Listen, was Russell at the casting?  JERRY  No, he didn't show up. ELAINE  You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?  JERRY  No. No you're not. ELAINE  Why do I keep setting you up? JERRY  I don't know. ELAINE  (to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.  JERRY  Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?  ELAINE  Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.  JERRY  Beside that. Look at the waitresses.  ELAINE  Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)  JERRY  What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?  ELAINE  Ah... JERRY  I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?  ELAINE  Yes, I would say. JERRY  What's going on here. How is that possible?  ELAINE  Do you think it's a coincidence? JERRY  No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.   (the waitress finally came with the coffee) ELAINE  (to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?  WAITRESS  He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)  ELAINE  You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?  JERRY  Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.   (scene ends)  (doctor's clinic) GEORGE  You see, It's right here. It's all white...  DOCTOR  Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.  GEORGE  You've never seen this before? DOCTOR  I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)  GEORGE  (dramatically) A what? DOCTOR  A biopsy. GEORGE  A biopsy? DOCTOR  Yeah. GEORGE  Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?  DOCTOR  Well I don't know what it is.  (scene ends)  (Jerry's) GEORGE  A biopsy! JERRY  What did he say? GEORGE  He said he didn't know what it was.  JERRY  Alright. So? GEORGE  When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a \"get outta here\". That's what I wanted to hear: \"Cancer? Get outta here?\"  JERRY  Well, maybe he doesn't have a \"get outta here\" kind of personality.  GEORGE  How could you be a doctor and not say \"get outta here\"? It should be part of the training at medical school: \"Cancer? Get outta here!\" \"Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?\" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)  JERRY  Can't you at least die with a little dignity?  GEORGE  No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?   (Kramer enters) JERRY  Hey. What happened to you yesterday?  KRAMER  I got mugged. GEORGE  You got mugged? JERRY  Mugged? KRAMER  Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.  JERRY  Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?  KRAMER  It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...   (door buzzer) JERRY  Yeah? ELAINE  It's me. JERRY  Come on up. KRAMER  But now I have a big problem, buddy.  JERRY  What is it? KRAMER  Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.  JERRY  You didn't go? KRAMER  No. And now I can't get it back.  (George gives back the sandwich to Jerry and goes to the bathroom)  KRAMER  How could you not think about it?  (Elaine enters) ELAINE  Hey. KRAMER  (mumbles and leaves) ELAINE  What's the matter with him? JERRY  He's a little backed up. ELAINE  Oh...  (George gets back from the bathroom and takes back the sandwich from Jerry's hand and sit on the couch.)  GEORGE  Elaine. ELAINE  So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.  JERRY  Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)   (Elaine goes into Jerry' bedroom) GEORGE  (to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.  ELAINE  So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.  GEORGE  Apply for a job? What for? ELAINE  Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirt, untucked)  GEORGE  It's a coincidence. JERRY  This is what you gonna wear? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  You're not gonna get the job. ELAINE  Exactly.  (phone rings, Jerry gets up and answers, Elaine sits on the couch's arm next to George and takes a bite of his sandwich)  JERRY  (to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)  ELAINE  Who was it? JERRY  TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.  ELAINE  What about the dogs? JERRY  They're having sex in the hotel room.   (scene ends)  (Peter McManus cafe, same table as earlier) Sandi Robbins) SANDI  So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.  JERRY  Yes. SANDI  And she's really your ex-girlfriend?  JERRY  Uh, Huh, yeah. SANDI  I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.  JERRY  Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.  SANDI  How would she eat a hamburger? JERRY  With her hands. SANDI  What about pasta? JERRY  Also with her hands. SANDI  Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced.  JERRY  Everything? SANDI  Everything. JERRY  All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.  SANDI  That's good. What's her favorite movie?  JERRY  Shaft. SANDI  You got to get me a picture. What about sex?  JERRY  She likes talking during sex. SANDI  Oh... dirty talking? JERRY  No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)  SANDI  Elaine. JERRY  What? SANDI  Call me Elaine. JERRY  All right. Elaine. SANDI  How does Elaine kiss? JERRY  Well-- SANDI  Does she kiss... like this? (she kisses Jerry)  JERRY  Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--  SANDI  Like this? (kisses again but with the spiral)  JERRY  I think you got it.  (scene ends)  (Monk's)  (Kramer and Tom at a the booth behind the cashier) TOM  I'll have a hamburger. That's it. KRAMER  Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.  TOM  This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.  KRAMER  You gotta play him like me. I'm Karmer.  TOM  I'm Kramer. KRAMER  Whoa, I'm Kramer.  (scene cuts to Elaine who enters and walks to the manager) MR. VISAKI  (foreign accent) What can I do for you? Would you like a table.  ELAINE  No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.  MR. VISAKI  (looks Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before.  ELAINE  Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.  MR. VISAKI  I don't think I need anyone else right now.  ELAINE  You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)  MR. VISAKI  What? What did I do?  (scene ends)  (The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Office) ELAINE  Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.  FRED  Who's Russ Meyer? ELAINE  Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.  FRED  Anyway, go on. ELAINE  Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.  FRED  (to a guy in the hall at the water cooler machine) Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.  PAUL  (to Elaine) Hi. ELAINE  Hi. FRED  Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.  PAUL  (to Elaine) Really?  THE END>",

Rita, Jay, Stu and Russell are sitting in the crowd's bleachers)  TOM  What do you mean made up? JERRY  It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.  TOM  You're crazy. JERRY  No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?  MICHAEL  What do you mean Danish? GEORGE  (to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)  JERRY  Danish. Is it from Denmark? MICHAEL  No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.  TOM  I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry.  RITA  (to Jay) Boy, talk about a show about nothing. (Jay, the integral producer, smiles stupidly)  GEORGE  Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling: \"take #!\") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going: \"They fooled *me* Jerry!\" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more: \"They *fooled* me Jerry!\". You see the difference?  TOM  I'm not gonna say it like that. GEORGE  Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)  YELLING GUY  (with the same bothered face and while he's looking at George) All right everybody, take a five.  GEORGE  (very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!  JERRY  George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.  GEORGE  Why is that? JERRY  I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?  GEORGE  Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?  JERRY  Why would he steal a box of raisins?  GEORGE  Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)   (scene cuts to the bleachers with the producers) RITA  (to Jay about Russell) What's with him? (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell?  RUSSELL  What? RITA  You O.K.? RUSSELL  Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves)   (scene cuts to Jerry sitting next to Sandi. They're both going through their copy of the script)  SANDI  What's the matter? JERRY  Nothing. SANDI  You're acting weird. Is anything wrong?  JERRY  No. SANDI  Are you breaking up with me? JERRY  Are we going out? SANDI  You're breaking up with me, aren't you? (almost crying)  JERRY  Do you want me to break up with you?  SANDI  If that's what you want. JERRY  I don't even know what you're talking about.  SANDI  Fine. Break up with me. JERRY  All right. We're broken up. SANDI  (little pause) Can we still be friends? (Jerry raises his head, staring ahead and wondering what's going on)   (scene cuts to George and Tom standing, backstage) GEORGE  Remember when you came to audition for us?  TOM  Yeah. GEORGE  There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?  TOM  What are you talking about? GEORGE  Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.  TOM  Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?  GEORGE  Oh, no, no-- TOM  (angry) Why would I steal a box of raisins!?  GEORGE  No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)  TOM  Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?  GEORGE  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.   (scene cuts to Russell, still on the set, but on the phone with Elaine)  RUSSELL  (nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him)  DAVID  Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.  RUSSELL  All right. All right. What's your name?  DAVID  David Richardson. RUSSELL  Get out! You're fired! DAVID  But Mr. Dalrimple-- RUSSELL  Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves)   (scene ends)  (Jerry's) GEORGE  The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.  JERRY  Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.  GEORGE  What do you mean? JERRY  Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!  GEORGE  Come on you're... uh... you're fine.  JERRY  This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.  GEORGE  What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.  JERRY  This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.  GEORGE  The guy playing Kramer threatened me.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  'cause I asked him about the raisins.  JERRY  You mentioned the raisins. GEORGE  Oh yeah. JERRY  Did he take 'em? GEORGE  I don't know. JERRY  Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?  GEORGE  That's what I'm trying to find out.   (Kramer enters slowly and carefully) JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Any luck? KRAMER  No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.  JERRY  What about bran? JERRY  Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.  KRAMER  Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.  JERRY  Oh, it's not that bad! GEORGE  Yes it is.  (Elaine enters) ELAINE  Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.  JERRY  (to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?  ELAINE  No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.  JERRY  Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.  ELAINE  Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.  JERRY  We need you there! ELAINE  (to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go? KRAMER  No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)   (scene ends)  (NBC, pilot's set, the taping)  The taping is about to begin.  People are walking into the studio.  Jerry is getting a makeup.  Michael walks around backstage, he seems nervous and agitated.   Rita, Stu and Jay are sitting in the crowd. Russell is missing.   George looks at his lip in a mirror.  Tom is sitting in his dressing room, eating the raisins.  Elaine walks into the studio, wearing and adjusting a blonde short-haired wig, and also wearing bold glsasses.   Scene cuts to the drugstore where Kramer is buying the dreaded apparatus.   Sandi, sitting next to Jerry who's still getting a makeup, is having her hair done.  SANDI  (to her hairdresser) No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!  ASSISTANT DRESSER  Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?  JERRY  Try Elaine. ASSISTANT DRESSER  Elaine? SANDI  Yes?  (scene cuts to the crowd. Elaine is sitting in the front with her disguise, and a guy behind her taps on her shoulder)  WILTON  Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?  ELAINE  Oh, right. WILTON  Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.   (scene cuts to Michael, backstage, still walking around nervously. He sees Jerry and runs to him)  MICHAEL  I can't remember my lines!!! JERRY  Just relax, you'll be fine. MICHAEL  I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!  JERRY  You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!  MICHAEL  Help me Jerry! Help me!  (scene cuts to the producers in the crowd) RITA  (to Stu) Where is Russell? STU  You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.  JAY  He hasn't been well. STU  (to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.  RITA  How pathetic.  (scene cuts to George on the same phone as Russell earlier)  GEORGE  This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)   (scene cuts to the crowd and we see Joe Devola is there)  (scene cuts to Kramer entering his apartment with the dreaded apparatus)   (scene cuts to George, happy, eating and double-dipping chips. Tom is staring at him, George notices him, and aborts a double-dip)  GEORGE  (he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.  TOM  How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?   (scene cuts to the presentor, Pat Hazell, talking to the crowd)  PAT HAZELL  Are you ready to meet our cast? (crowd applause) All right.   (scene cuts to Kramer holding and staring at the dreaded apparatus, then closing his bathroom's door.)   (scene cuts to Jerry, holding a microphone and talking to the crowd)  JERRY  Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--  JOE DEVOLA  (getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling)   (scene ends)  (Jerry's) GEORGE  Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?  JERRY  Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.  GEORGE  Really? What does it mean? JERRY  It means: \"Death to tyrants\". GEORGE  I can see that.  (Elaine enters) ELAINE  See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?  JERRY  No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?  ELAINE  Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.  GEORGE  Yeah, me too. JERRY  Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?  ELAINE  No. JERRY  Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...   (Kramer enters, singing and dancing) KRAMER  Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!  JERRY  Well, well, well. ELAINE  Congratulations. KRAMER  Well, thank you. GEORGE  You went for the big \"E\". KRAMER  Wet and wild. JERRY  All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.  KRAMER  Oh, yes.  (Elaine finds something under the couch cushions) ELAINE  Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet. JERRY  A wallet? Let me see that. ELAINE  Here. JERRY  Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.  GEORGE  Shh! This is it! JERRY  How do you like that? (Jerry's) Jerry's apartment with Elaine, George and Kramer watching the pilot.   (TV) The pilot  (Viewers) Characters from the season 4, watching TV in their home and commenting on the pilot.)   ===(TV)=== \"I get into a car accident. The guy that hit me doesn't have any insurance. So the judge sentences him to be my butler. Sounds like a sitcom, doesn't it?\"   ===(Jerry's)===  (they all applause as the intro ends) ELAINE  Bravo!  (Kramer taps George on the shoulder) GEORGE  You hurt me.  ===(TV)===  (Jerry's apartment, Michael knocks and enters) MICHAEL  Hey. JERRY  Hey George. MICHAEL  New sneakers? JERRY  Yeah. MICHAEL  What do you need new sneakers for?  JERRY  I like sneakers. MICHAEL  How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day.  JERRY  Nah, you're crazy anyway.  ===(Viewers)====  *  (Susan and Allison from 'The Smelly Car'. They're eating popcorn, sitting on a couch)  SUSAN AND ALLSION  (to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!   *  (Sid and the housekeeper from 'The Old Man') SID  What kind of stupid show is this? Hey! It's that idiot that took all my records! (the houskeeper starts laughing)   *  (John-John and Marla the virgin from 'The Contest'. Marla is under the bed sheets while John-John is sitting at the end of the bed, with the TV remote in his hands)  MARLA  John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.  JOHN  (with a Boston accent) This show looks interesting. Isn't he that Seinfeld fellow you went out with?  MARLA  Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible! JOHN  Nevertheless...  *  (The Drake, who went back with the Drakette, Allison, from 'The Handicap Spot'.

JERRY  Yeah.  ===(TV)===  (doorbell, Jerry opens the door, it's the butler, Charles) JERRY  Hello, Charles. CHARLES  Hello. So, where do you want me to start today?  JERRY  Why don't you start in the bedroom?  CHARLES  (to himself, upset) Start in the bedroom...   (Tom enters) TOM  Hey. JERRY  Hey. The butler's here. TOM  He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house.  JERRY  I'm not sending him to your house.  TOM  Why not? JERRY  Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.  TOM  Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do.  JERRY  But I don't want to. KRAMER  Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.   (buzzer, Jerry presses the button) JERRY  Yeah? SANDI  (from the buzzer's speaker) It's Elaine.  JERRY  Come on up.

CHARLES  Well, it goes fast.  (Sandi enters) SANDI  (to Charles, very friendly) Hello.  CHARLES  Hello. (he goes back in the bedroom)  JERRY  What's all this about? SANDI  We had a date. JERRY  You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?  SANDI  Why do I need your permission?

(quick shot at (Jerry's) they all watch) JERRY  You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) \"Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you\".   (end of the pilot and of the three different settings)  (back to Jerry's) ALL  (applauding and shaking hands) Wooh! Yeah!  ELAINE  Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.  JERRY  Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)  ELAINE  That was so good. JERRY  Come on let's eat something.

JERRY  (to the phone) Hello? RITA  Hi Jerry, this is Rita Kierson. JERRY  Oh, hi Rita. RITA  I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network.  JERRY  Oh, my God. Did he get fired? RITA  To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.  JERRY  Russell's disappeared? RITA  In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show.  JERRY  You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!  RITA  Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry.  JERRY  Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)  (Jerry and George stare at Elaine) ELAINE  What-- What are you looking at me for?  GEORGE  It was you! ELAINE  What did I do? JERRY  Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?  ELAINE  I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.  GEORGE  Yes it is! You're very charming! ELAINE  I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?  JERRY  No one knows.  (scnen ends)  (Greenpeace raft on the ocean, following a whaler)  (Russell with two other guys in the Greenpeace boat) RUSSELL  She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me.  MAN ON RAFT  You'd better get down. They might start firing soon. (harpoon fires)   (scene ends)  (Monk's)  (The restaurant is full of men, some of them standing and waiting for a table. Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer enters)  JERRY  Hey look at this. What is going on here?  GEORGE  Well, well, well. ELAINE  Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?  FRED  Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out.  PAUL  Yeah, we're checking it out. ELAINE  (to Paul) You're checking it out?  (a man is leaving the restaurant and walks by Fred and Paul's table)  MAN  (to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys.  MR. VISAKI  Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner? Boy, you guys ought to move in. How about a piece of pie on me? Sophia! Take care of these fellows.  ELAINE  (to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!  MR. VISAKI  Get away with what? ELAINE  Ah, \"with what?\" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.  MR. VISAKI  Of course they're alike. They're my daughters.   (they all show smiles of surprise) ELAINE  (embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters.  GEORGE  You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.  MR.

A very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find you way back after you left.   (Monk's) JERRY  So, what's her name? GEORGE  Karin. JERRY  Is she nice? GEORGE  Great. JERRY  So you like her? GEORGE  I think so. JERRY  You don't know? GEORGE  I can't tell anymore. JERRY  Well do you feel anything? GEORGE  Feel? What's that? JERRY  All right, let me ask you this: when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?  GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?  GEORGE  Cleaning JERRY  You do the tub? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  On your knees, Ajax, scrubbing, the whole deal?  GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Okay, I think you're in love! GEORGE  Tub is love? JERRY  Tub is love. So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.  GEORGE  Yep. There's one little problem. JERRY  Sexual? GEORGE  Yeeeaaah. Well..... I've never really feld confident in..... one particular aspect.  JERRY  Below the equator? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.  GEORGE  I don't know. Last time I got the tap.  JERRY  You got the tap? GEORGE  You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.  JERRY  The tap is tough. GEORGE  It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.  JERRY  Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.  GEORGE  No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.  JERRY  It's a very complicated area. GEORGE  You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.  JERRY  It's a haaazy mystery. GEORGE  Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.   (Elaine joins them) ELAINE  Who's faking? GEORGE  Nothing. ELAINE  Faking what? GEORGE  Nobody's faking. ELAINE  Ah! Orgasm? GEORGE  She's not faking! ELAINE  How do you know? GEORGE  I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?  ELAINE  Of course. JERRY  Really? GEORGE  You faked? ELAINE  On occasion. JERRY  And the guy never knows? ELAINE  No. JERRY  How can he not know that? ELAINE  Because I was gooood. JERRY  I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.   (Jerry and George laugh) ELAINE  You didn't know. JERRY  What? ELAINE  You didn't know. JERRY  Are you saying...  (George calls a waitress) GEORGE  I think I'll have a piece of cake.  JERRY  With me? ELAINE  Well... JERRY  You faked with me? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  You faked with me? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  No. ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  You faked it? ELAINE  I faked it. JERRY  That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?  ELAINE  Not bad huh? JERRY  What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?  ELAINE  Fake, fake, fake, fake. JERRY  I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?  ELAINE  Uuuhm, all the time. JERRY  All the time?! GEORGE  We got a chocolate malt in here! JERRY  But I'm so good. GEORGE  I'm sure you are. ELAINE  Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.  JERRY  She faked.  (George smiles sarcastically) JERRY  Maybe they've all been faking. ELAINE  I'm sure they're not. GEORGE  Maybe Karin is faking.  (Jerry's apartment)  (Kramer is lighting his cigar on the stove) KRAMER  She was probably joking. JERRY  No no, it was no joke. KRAMER  She didn't have any? JERRY  No. None. KRAMER  She faked 'em all. JERRY  Faked 'em all. KRAMER  Well so she faked 'em, so what? JERRY  The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.  KRAMER  You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.  JERRY  How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.  KRAMER  Yeah I could have helped you out. JERRY  What could you have done? KRAMER  I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons body.  JERRY  I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.  KRAMER  Aaaaah. JERRY  Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.   (The phone rings) KRAMER  Giddy-up.  (Jerry picks it up) JERRY  Hello... Oh hello Elaine. ELAINE  So we're having dinner tonight? JERRY  I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.  ELAINE  Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?  JERRY  What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.  ELAINE  Nooo, the other thing. JERRY  Oooh that. Well... ELAINE  Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.  JERRY  Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?  ELAINE  Okay. JERRY  All right. ELAINE  All right, see you later. JERRY  Bye. ELAINE  Bye.  (Elaine's office)  (Rene walks passed the office) ELAINE  Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something: have you ever... you know... faked it?  RENE  Yeah, sometimes. ELAINE  Really, like when? RENE  Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats.  ELAINE  Yeah, well... RENE  Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep.   (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  I really don't feel like seeing her.  KRAMER  You know, I faked it. JERRY  What?! KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  You faked it? Why would you do that?  KRAMER  Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.  JERRY  Yeah, but why would you...  (Kramer spits out his peach) JERRY  Bad peach? KRAMER  It's terrible! JERRY  Did you get that at Joe's? KRAMER  Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.  JERRY  That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.  KRAMER  You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return this.  JERRY  You're returning used fruit? KRAMER  Jerry this peach is sub par.  (Joe's) JOE  So what do you want me to do? KRAMER  I want restitution. JOE  Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?  KRAMER  Because it's no good. JOE  When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.  KRAMER  It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.  JOE  I stand behind my fruit. KRAMER  So... JOE  Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.  KRAMER  You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.  JOE  Well let me put a solution for you: do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.  KRAMER  Oh now you don't want my business.  JOE  No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!  KRAMER  But what am I gonna do for fruit?  (restaurant)  (Karin starts moaning and lights a cigarette after finishing dinner)  GEORGE  You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?  KARIN  I'm very satisfied. GEORGE  I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?  KARIN  I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.  GEORGE  Hey listen... instead of the movie... maybe we'll go back and... you know...  KARIN  Maybe. GEORGE  So... you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... generally okay with everything in there?  KARIN  Generally. GEORGE  Do you feel the way you feel after the Risotto?  KARIN  No, I feel full after the Risotto.  GEORGE  Yeah... full.  ((another) restaurant)  (Elaine starts moaning after finishing dinner) JERRY  Satisfied? ELAINE  Hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?  JERRY  Meryl Streep? ELAINE  You don't like her? JERRY  Ah, she's okay. ELAINE  I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.  JERRY  Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?  ELAINE  I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.  JERRY  Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?  ELAINE  What's the matter? JERRY  Nothing. ELAINE  You're not still thinking about that are you?  JERRY  Nooo. ELAINE  Oh good. JERRY  Give me another shot! ELAINE  What? JERRY  Another shot, I want another shot.  ELAINE  You mean...? JERRY  Yes! ELAINE  Oooh no, I don't think so. JERRY  Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!  ELAINE  Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.  JERRY  Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .  ELAINE  Jerry no, that's important to me. JERRY  We won't ruin the friendship. ELAINE  Yes we will! JERRY  Elaine... ELAINE  No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.  JERRY  A half hour, give me a half our. ELAINE  No! JERRY  Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!  ELAINE  No! JERRY  You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?  ELAINE  What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.  JERRY  That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.  ELAINE  That is so ridiculous. JERRY  Come on, Elaine! ELAINE  No. JERRY  Elaine?! ELAINE  No!  (Karin's bedroom)  (George indicates that the sex went wrong) GEORGE  It's Jerry's fault. KARIN  Jerry? GEORGE  Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.  KARIN  Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.  GEORGE  So you feel okay? KARIN  Well, it's not like after the Risotto.   (Jerry's car) JERRY  Well good night. ELAINE  I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.  JERRY  Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.  ELAINE  Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).  JERRY  Oh what, you're upset? ELAINE  Yes I'm upset, can't you tell? JERRY  No I can't, maybe you're faking. ELAINE  I'm really, really sorry I told you that.  JERRY  I'm sorry too. ELAINE  Well stop being such a baby. JERRY  You're a baby! ELAINE  You're a baby!  (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'  JERRY  They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?  GEORGE  I hate 'em! JERRY  You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.  GEORGE  It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.   (Kramer enters the apartment) KRAMER  Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?  JERRY  Why can't you get it? KRAMER  Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.  JERRY  What happened? KRAMER  Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and... well Joe doesn't want my business.  GEORGE  Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?  JERRY  No. (And to Kramer:) I told you not to say anything.  KRAMER  Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?  JERRY  Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.  KRAMER  The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!  JERRY  Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?  GEORGE  Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?   (George leaves the apartment)  (The phone rings, Jerry picks it up) JERRY  Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I just wanted to ask you a question: when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Okay, bye.   (Jerry hangs up the phone) JERRY  Patty Lawrence had 'em! KRAMER  Okay, I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?  JERRY  Yeah.  (Jerry makes another call) JERRY  Hello Elaine? Patty Lorens had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?   (outside Joe's) JERRY  Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?  KRAMER  All right now here's the list. JERRY  All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?  KRAMER  I like mangos. JERRY  Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.  KRAMER  Well they gotta be soft. JERRY  How soft? KRAMER  Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.  JERRY  I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?  KRAMER  Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.  JERRY  Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?  KRAMER  Oh! And get some plantains. JERRY  Plantains? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  What the hell is a plantain. KRAMER  It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.  JERRY  You're not getting any plantains.  (Jerry enters Joe's) JERRY  Hey Joe. JOE  How is it going? JERRY  Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. I don't know let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... ooo, just right... and three plantains ought to do it.  JOE  All right, all right, just hold it right there.  JERRY  What? JOE  This fruit isn't for you. JERRY  What, what are you talking about? JOE  You think I don't know? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!  JERRY  I can't buy mangos and plantains? JOE  All right, get out! JERRY  You're making a big mistake, Joe! JOE  I'll tell you something else: I don't what your business anymore either.  JERRY  You're saying you're banning me from the store?  JOE  That's exactly what I'm saying. JERRY  I'm banned?! JOE  You're banned.  (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  All right, where do you want it? JERRY  Put it over there. KRAMER  Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, you did good George.   (Kramer leaves the apartment) GEORGE  All right I gotta get going. JERRY  What are you doing? GEORGE  I got a date with Karin. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.  JERRY  You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.  GEORGE  I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.   (Kramer enters the apartment) KRAMER  This mango is delicious! GEORGE  That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.  JERRY  Sorry, I don't have any cash. KRAMER  I only got hundreds. GEORGE  All right I knew it. KRAMER  Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.  GEORGE  I don't want any mango. KRAMER  Come on, take some. It's good.  (George tries a piece) GEORGE  Very good. Juicy. Ripe. This Joe's got some terrific fruit.   (George looks a little weird) JERRY  What? GEORGE  I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!  KRAMER  I told you.  (George stands still) JERRY  What is it? GEORGE  I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.   (Elaine enters the apartment) ELAINE  Hi George. GEORGE  I'm back, baby, I'm back!  (George leaves the apartment) KRAMER  Want some mango? ELAINE  No, thanks.  (Kramer leaves the apartment) JERRY  Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. What brings you here?  ELAINE  Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.  JERRY  Oh and I've got some things of yours here.  ELAINE  I know. JERRY  Well I'll get them. ELAINE  I'm waiting. JERRY  All right. You got my fins? ELAINE  Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?  JERRY  I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?  ELAINE  They're next to the fins. You got my cards?  JERRY  They're next to the poker chips.  (They switch bags) ELAINE  All right and that just about... does it.  JERRY  I guess. ELAINE  Okay, well... see you around. JERRY  Yeah, see you.  (Elaine opens the door and then closes it again) ELAINE  All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.  JERRY  What? ELAINE  Come on! JERRY  Are you serious? ELAINE  Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.  JERRY  Sex... to save the friendship. Well, if we have to...   (Karin's bedroom) KARIN  Oh George, oooh. GEORGE  Please, it's not necessary. KARIN  What do you mean it's not necessary?  GEORGE  The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?  KARIN  What are you talking about? GEORGE  What am I talking about? Come on. You don't think I bought all that?  KARIN  What, what? GEORGE  You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. You really had me going there for a minute.  KARIN  You think I was faking? GEORGE  Come on: 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.  KARIN  I'd like you to leave. GEORGE  What? KARIN  I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.  GEORGE  But why? KARIN  Because I said so. GEORGE  I can't find my glasses. KARIN  Well hurry up. GEORGE  I need to look for my glasses. KARIN  Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!  (Jerry's bedroom)  (Elaine is reading a magazine and Jerry is making desperate noises)  JERRY  It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. He got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!  ELAINE  You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?   (Jerry looks like he's got an idea)   THE END>",

JERRY  Oh, it won't be for that long. GEORGE  How can I do this?! How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me! They're insane! You know that.  JERRY  Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.  GEORGE  How can you compare you parents to my parents?!  JERRY  My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!  GEORGE  My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!  JERRY  My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.  GEORGE  (Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'  JERRY  A smirk? GEORGE  Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!  JERRY  I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.  GEORGE  No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.   (Kramer stumbles in) KRAMER  Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?  GEORGE  I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.  KRAMER  Well, move in here. JERRY  (Stopping the notion) What's that?  KRAMER  Why doesn't he just move in here? GEORGE  (Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!  KRAMER  You can move in with me, if you want.  GEORGE  (Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.   (Scene ends)  (The Costanza's house)  (Jerry, George, and Kramer enter carrying George's luggage. Kramer clumsily bangs the wall with one of the suitcases)  ESTELLE  Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!  KRAMER  Hello, Mrs. Costanza. ESTELLE  Hello, Kramer. Close the door.  (They set down George's luggage) KRAMER  Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)  ESTELLE  More stuff?! KRAMER  Yeah. (Exits) ESTELLE  (To George) How much is there?! GEORGE  (Annoyed) There's more. ESTELLE  So, how are ya, Jerry? JERRY  Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..  ESTELLE  (Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.  JERRY  No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-  ESTELLE  (Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna   sandwiches. GEORGE  Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!  ESTELLE  What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.  JERRY  No thanks.  (Kramer enters with some more suitcases) ESTELLE  Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?  KRAMER  Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)  ESTELLE  I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.  JERRY  I really don't eat it. ESTELLE  What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?  JERRY  I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..  KRAMER  (Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?  GEORGE  (Muttering) No, that's it.  (A horn honks from outside the house) KRAMER  Oh, I gotta go move the car. (Leaves)  JERRY  Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)  GEORGE  (Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Wha - what are you doing later? JERRY  Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.  GEORGE  Really? JERRY  Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was   that?' GEORGE  Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya? ESTELLE  No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.  GEORGE  (Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.  JERRY  Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)  (George watches his mother sitting contentedly on the couch. She's staring off into space)  GEORGE  Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)   (Scene ends)  (A Restaurant)  (Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and Leslie are all laughing) ELAINE  Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)  JERRY  Right. ELIANE  You remember that? KRAMER  Yeah, well, that was a good one. JERRY  Well..  (Kramer's girlfriend starts to mumble out some words, but Kramer's the only one who seems to hear her. Jerry and Elaine both bend forward, trying to hear what   she's saying) ELAINE  What's that? JERRY  Excuse me?  (She 'talks' some more. Jerry and Elaine still can't hear her. They give up - leaning back in their seats)  JERRY  Yeah.. yeah. ELAINE  Yep. Yeah.. KRAMER  You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.  ELAINE  (Interested) Oh? KRAMER  In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah,   it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear. ELAINE  Oh, a puffy shirt. JERRY  Puffy. KRAMER  Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..   (Leslie starts 'talking', Kramer laughs. Jerry and Elaine have no clue what she's saying. They lean closer)  KRAMER  (Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)  ELAINE  Uh, oh! (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the \"Today\" show on Friday.  JERRY  Yeah, that's right! ELAINE  Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless..  JERRY  (Points at Elaine) And the indigent.  ELAINE  And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.   (Leslie starts talking. Of course, Jerry and Elaine can't hear her voice)  JERRY  Sure. ELAINE  Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.  (Leslie talks some more) JERRY  Uh-huh. ELAINE  Yep. JERRY  Yep.. ELAINE  Mmm  (Scene ends)  (A Restaurant) ESTELLE  Maybe you should take a civil service test.  GEORGE  (Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.  FRANK  Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?  GEORGE  Yes, I've seen a silver dollar. ELAINE  Why don't you want to take a civil service test?  GEORGE  To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?  FRANK  Would you believe when I was 18, I had a silver dollar collection?  ESTELLE  I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..  GEORGE  I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?  FRANK  (Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.  ESTELLE  So what are you gonna do?! GEORGE  I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!  FRANK  I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.  GEORGE  (Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..  FRANK  I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.  GEORGE  (Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..  ESTELLE  George, where are you going?! GEORGE  (Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.   (Scene cuts to the front of the restaurant. George accidentally runs into a woman - causing her to drop her purse. Items spill out onto the floor)  GEORGE  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)  WOMAN  Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!  GEORGE  (Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..  WOMAN  No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)  GEORGE  It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..   (George hands the last of the items to her, she takes them from him, then starts to admire his hand)  WOMAN  Hmm.. GEORGE  What? WOMAN  (Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.  GEORGE  What about them? WOMAN  They're quite exquisite! GEORGE  They are? WOMAN  (Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?  GEORGE  Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')  WOMAN  (Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)   (Scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (George is holding up his hands for Jerry to see) JERRY  (Shrugs) I - I don't get it. GEORGE  Me neither! JERRY  What is it? GEORGE  I don't know. JERRY  They're hands! GEORGE  This woman just set me up for a job!  JERRY  (Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.  GEORGE  What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off   comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)  JERRY  Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.  GEORGE  This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a   noise) I bop into this woman..  (Enter Kramer) KRAMER  Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)  JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)  GEORGE  What are you, crazy?! What are you, crazy?!  KRAMER  What?! GEORGE  You coulda damaged my hand! KRAMER  (Laughing) But, it's only a toy! JERRY  (Explaining) George has become a hand model.  KRAMER  A hand model? JERRY  Yes. KRAMER  (To George) Really? Let me look at them..  GEORGE  (Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out. Kramer studies them)  KRAMER  Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.  GEORGE  (Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.  JERRY  Oven mitts? GEORGE  (Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?  KRAMER  Yeah.. JERRY  Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)  GEORGE  Thank you very much. (Walks out)  (Jerry shuts the door, then starts going through his mail) KRAMER  You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting   all these orders from boutiques and department stores.. JERRY  Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?  KRAMER  Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)  JERRY  What are you talking about? KRAMER  When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)  JERRY  (Goes up to it) This? KRAMER  Yes! JERRY  I agreed to wear this?! KRAMER  Yeah, yeah. JERRY  But, when did I do that? KRAMER  When we went to dinner the other night.  JERRY  What are you, crazy?! KRAMER  What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?  JERRY  I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!  KRAMER  There you go. JERRY  Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!  KRAMER  Yes, yes! You said it! JERRY  But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!  KRAMER  (Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.  JERRY  I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!  KRAMER  Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New   Jersey is already makin' them! JERRY  They're making these?! KRAMER  Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, - this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!  JERRY  (Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!   (Scene ends)  (The Costanza house)  (George is giving himself a manicure over a tray. He's carefully primping his fingernails)  ESTELLE  I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?  FRANK  (Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?  ESTELLE  (Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!  FRANK  You never mentioned them to me! GEORGE  (Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.   (Estelle hands an Emory board to George. He takes it, then goes back to his manicure)  ESTELLE  I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..  FRANK  No! You never said milky white! ESTELLE  (Getting angry) I said milky white!   (A moment passes as George fights to keep his temper down around his parents)  GEORGE  (To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!   (Estelle, visibly nervous, reacts, flipping the scissors around)  ESTELLE  I'm sorry. GEORGE  You're sorry?! ESTELLE  (Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.  GEORGE  (Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)   (Another moment passes as George primps his hands) ESTELLE  Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work) Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?  FRANK  (To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!  ESTELLE  (Yelling) George likes the bananas!  FRANK  (Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!   (George stands up with the manicure tray. He's obviously had enough)  GEORGE  Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the   morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.  ESTELLE  (Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?  GEORGE  (Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)   (Scene ends)  (A Today Show dressing room)  (Jerry's in a back room, getting dressed while Kramer's thumbing through a magazine. There's a knock at the door)  KRAMER  Yeah, come in.  (A Today Show stagehand enters) STAGEHAND  I just wanted to let you know he's got about five minutes.  KRAMER  Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes!   (Jerry walks out from the back room wearing the 'puffy' shirt. He has the expression of extreme resentment)  KRAMER  Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Ayye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around   Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic! JERRY  (Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I can't wear this!  KRAMER  (Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate   look. Aye!  (A knock at the door, Kramer answers it - it's Elaine) KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!  KRAMER  Great.  (Elaine stops in her tracks when she sees Jerry in the shirt. Then, bursts out laughing hysterically)  ELAINE  (Between laughs) What is that?! KRAMER  It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?  ELAINE  (To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?  JERRY  (Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?'? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why!   And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!  ELAINE  When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?  JERRY  When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.  ELAINE  I didn't hear anything. JERRY  (Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!  ELAINE  (Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.  KRAMER  (To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?  ELAINE  (Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out   dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!  JERRY  (Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!  ELAINE  (Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a   chandelier!  (A knock at the door, Jerry answers) STAGEHAND  (Looking down at a clipboard, enters) Okay, let's go. (Looks up, points at Jerry's puffy shirt) Is that what you're wearing?   (Scene ends)  (A photographer's studio)  (George is holding out his hands while a man and woman marvel at them. A photographer is fooling around with a camera towards the right wall)  MAN  I've never seen hands like these before..  WOMAN  They're so soft and milky white. PHOTOGRAPHER  You know who's hands they remind me of? (Pauses for effect) Ray McKigney.   (The woman nods as the man looks off into space) MAN  Ugh.. Ray. PHOTOGRAPHER  He was it. GEORGE  Who was he? PHOTOGRAPHER  The most exquisite hands you've ever seen.. Oh, he had it all.  GEORGE  (Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?   (Obviously a touchy subject, the woman coyly walks over to the photographer, and they both occupy themselves. The man is left to tell George the answer to his   question) MAN  (Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his   one true love..  (Long pause) GEORGE  You mean, uh..? MAN  Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.  GEORGE  (Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?  MAN  (Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing   but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the   end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't   seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's.. until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I.. only hope you have a little more   self-control. GEORGE  (Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.   (The man nods, unsure of what to say or do) PHOTOGRAPHER  Ok, let's get to work.  (Scene ends)  (The Today Show)  (Jerry's in the guest chair, and Bryant Gumbel's in the interviewer's spot. Jerry, visibly, does not want to be there)  BRYANT  (Talking directly to the camera) Back now, 7:46. On Tuesday the 19th here in New York there will be a benefit for the Goodwill Industries - a used   clothing organization that provides service to the needy. One of the performers will be comedian Jerry Seinfeld. (Turns to face Jerry) Jerry, good morning.  JERRY  (Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant. BRYANT  (Pointing out) And speaking of clothing , that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.  JERRY  (Looking down at the shirt) Oh, thank you.   (Backstage, Kramer's standing with his girlfriend. She's brimming with pride)  BRYANT  You're all kinda, (Waves his hands around) all kinda \"puffed up\". (Chuckles)  JERRY  Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.   THE END>",

Night Guy wants to stay up late. 'What about getting up after five hours sleep?', oh that's Morning Guy's problem. That's not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay up as late as I want. So you get up in the morning, you're ..... (?), you're exhausted, groggy, oooh I hate that Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning Guy can do. The only Morning Guy can do is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy looses his job and Night Guy has no money to go out anymore.   (Jerry's apartment)  (Elaine and Jerry hang out the window) ELAINE  Do you ever spit on anybody from here?  JERRY  No. You? ELAINE  No. Do you ever think about it? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Me too.  (Kramer enters the apartment) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Well I got it! JERRY  You got me the air conditioner? KRAMER  What do you think? JERRY  Beautiful! ELAINE  What air conditioner? KRAMER  My buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.  JERRY  Is it a good one? KRAMER  Good one? It's the Commando 8. JERRY  Commando 8? KRAMER  12.000 BTU's. ELAINE  I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.  KRAMER  Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.  ELAINE  Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice:) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.  JERRY  All right. KRAMER  Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?  JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Yeah.  (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) KRAMER  Yeah, rock on!  (Kramer leaves the apartment) GEORGE  I gotta get out of this city. JERRY  So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth?  GEORGE  I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?  ELAINE  You don't have an old pair? GEORGE  I broke 'em playing basketball. JERRY  He was running from a bee. GEORGE  Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.  ELAINE  George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?  JERRY  There's a lot of change down there.  GEORGE  When I find that guy, this much I vow: those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.  JERRY  We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!   (Kramer enters the apartment) GEORGE  What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?  ELAINE  Yeah, especially those frames. KRAMER  You know you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J &amp; T Optical and Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.  GEORGE  Yeah, come on. JERRY  Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.  GEORGE  Really? KRAMER  Retail is for suckers. GEORGE  Wow. What do I have to do? KRAMER  You just gotta mention my name. GEORGE  That's it? KRAMER  That's it.  (J &amp; T Optical)  (George tries on a pair of glasses) GEORGE  What about these? ELAINE  They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.  GEORGE  It's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.  JERRY  Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it!  ELAINE  Now those look good, they're very bold.  GEORGE  Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?  JERRY  (While looking at posters of women wearing glasses:) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.   (A man with a dog enters the store) ELAINE  Hi there, little doggy. (And to the owner:) Do you mind if I pet your dog?  DOG OWNER  It's okay with me. ELAINE  Hey little doggy.  (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) ELAINE  Aaah! DWAYNE  Hey, you can't have that dog in here.   (The man leaves the store taking his dog with him) JERRY  Are you okay? Did he bite you? GEORGE  Can you believe that guy? ELAINE  I'm okay, it's just a nick. GEORGE  He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time!   (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) GEORGE  You! Dog man!  (George, without his glasses, squints and it looks like he sees something interesting. He enters the store again)  ELAINE  My leg looks pretty bad. JERRY  Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.  ELAINE  Okay. JERRY  (To George:) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?  GEORGE  Uuh, no. JERRY  All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.  GEORGE  (In a really strange way:) Good, good, do that.  JERRY  What's the matter? GEORGE  Oh, no, nothing. JERRY  What is it? GEORGE  I can't tell you. ELAINE  Jerry, can we go? JERRY  Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George:) What do you mean you can't tell me?  GEORGE  I can't tell you, don't ask. JERRY  I'm asking! ELAINE  Jerry, my leg. JERRY  Yeah, yeah, take care.  (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) JERRY  Come on, George, what is it? GEORGE  I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.  JERRY  What? GEORGE  They were right outside! JERRY  Amy and Jeffrey? GEORGE  Yes! JERRY  Are you sure? GEORGE  Yes, positive. JERRY  But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.  GEORGE  I know! I was squinting. ELAINE  Listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.  JERRY  We're gonna have to talk about this later.   (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry) JERRY  Thank you. Taxi!  (Jerry and Elaine leave the store)  (George tries on another pair of glasses) GEORGE  (To the store owner:) Excuse me, what do you think of these?  DWAYNE  Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame.  GEORGE  Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.  DWAYNE  All right, you have a prescription?  GEORGE  Yeah.  (George hands over the prescription) GEORGE  Kramer... DWAYNE  What? GEORGE  Kramer... DWAYNE  What about him? GEORGE  You do know Kramer? DWAYNE  Yes... GEORGE  Well, I'm mentioning his name. DWAYNE  Why? GEORGE  Because... you know... DWAYNE  No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.   (hospital) ELAINE  Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!  JERRY  Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.  ELAINE  Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!  JERRY  But he was squinting. ELAINE  So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.  JERRY  Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!  DOCTER  Okay. ELAINE  Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?  DOCTER  Not shot, dog bite. ELAINE  No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?  DOCTER  Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang.   (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and Amy watch television) JERRY  Now, look at this. Cable's out. AMY  Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv.  JERRY  No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing.   (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) JERRY  I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?  AMY  Yesterday? JERRY  Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.  AMY  I didn't do anything. JERRY  Oh you must have done something. AMY  No, nothing really. JERRY  Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?  AMY  Well, I did go out for a little while.  JERRY  Well, your day's getting more interesting already.   (Jerry shows the phone) JERRY  Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.  AMY  You can't thrust anyone. JERRY  No you can't. Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?  AMY  What are you talking about? JERRY  Look, my friend saw you. AMY  Saw me? With who? JERRY  You tell me. AMY  There's nothing to tell. JERRY  There isn't? AMY  No. JERRY  Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?   (Amy stands up and walks away) AMY  I had a feeling this was to good to be true.  JERRY  Why? AMY  I knew there had to be another side to you.  JERRY  No, no, there's no side! AMY  There is a side, an ugly side. JERRY  No, no, no ugly side. AMY  Look, I think I'm gonna go. JERRY  Why? AMY  It's really hot in here. JERRY  Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?  AMY  Yeah. When are you getting an air conditioner?  JERRY  It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.   (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  I was an idiot for listening to you!  GEORGE  Hey, I saw what I saw. JERRY  Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.  GEORGE  What side? JERRY  A bad side, an ugly side. GEORGE  Ooh, so what? JERRY  So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.  GEORGE  Why don't you just ask Jeffrey? JERRY  Ah, he'd just deny it. GEORGE  There must be some way to find out.  JERRY  Amy said nothing happened. GEORGE  What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!  JERRY  Yeah, but you're blind as a bat! GEORGE  I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting those raccoons.  JERRY  They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.  GEORGE  Hey look, a dime.  (George walks over to the other end of the room and picks up a dime)  GEORGE  Mercury head. You mind? JERRY  (Stunned:) No, keep it.  (Elaine enters the apartment) JERRY  Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.  ELAINE  There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.  JERRY  A little white dog? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?  ELAINE  I'm afraid of dogs now. JERRY  He's like a squirrel. ELAINE  Well he frightened me. GEORGE  Did you get the shot? ELAINE  No. He said I didn't need a shot. GEORGE  You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?  ELAINE  What, you think I should have?  (George indicates 'yes') JERRY  You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.  ELAINE  All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.   (Kramer enters the apartment) KRAMER  The AC is on his way. GEORGE  Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.  KRAMER  What? GEORGE  That's right, no discount! KRAMER  Well did you mention my name? GEORGE  Yes, I mentioned your name. KRAMER  And? GEORGE  Bubkis! KRAMER  Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.  GEORGE  All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.  JERRY  Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!  KRAMER  Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!   (George takes a bite out of an union) ELAINE  You know, George, that's an union.  GEORGE  Yes it is.  (And he takes another bite) ELAINE  He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?  GEORGE  I saw them making out, you can believe it.  JERRY  I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.  KRAMER  Look, all you gotta to is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.  JERRY  Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.  KRAMER  Right this way, mister Doody! GEORGE  You'll see I'm right.  (J &amp; T Optical) KRAMER  Hey, Dwayny. DWAYNE  Oh hello Kramer. KRAMER  What is going on here? DWAYNE  What are you talking about? KRAMER  I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.  ELAINE  Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...  GEORGE  Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.  DWAYNE  Who said anything about a discount.  KRAMER  Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.  DWAYNE  For what?  (Kramer pulls out a candy bar) KRAMER  Remember this? DWAYNE  What are you doing? KRAMER  Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?  DWAYNE  Put that away! KRAMER  Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all hopped up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuff a cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!  DWAYNE  All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us.  ELAINE  Can I just have the name... DWAYNE  Out! KRAMER  We'll see you Dwayne.  (Jerry's apartment)  (George shows Jerry his glasses) JERRY  I don't know what to tell you, Elton.  ELAINE  (While reading a book:) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies: anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!  JERRY  (To George:) Who picked these out?  GEORGE  I did! JERRY  They're ladies' glasses! All you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.  GEORGE  Well Elaine was supposed to help me.   (Elaine runs over to George and starts screaming) ELAINE  Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!  JERRY  Hey, hey. ELAINE  I'm sorry... sorry.  (Kramer enters the apartment with the air conditioner in his arms)  KRAMER  Commando 8 has arrived! JERRY  Take it to the window. KRAMER  12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power.   (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) KRAMER  Installed! GEORGE  That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?  KRAMER  No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry:) I'll seal that up later, right?  JERRY  Just in time for Amy. GEORGE  Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plead?  ELAINE  I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!  KRAMER  Of what? JERRY  Rabies. KRAMER  Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!   (Elaine runs over to Kramer and starts screaming again) ELAINE  I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!  JERRY  Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?  ELAINE  I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry. KRAMER  No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once.   (George's eating chips) KRAMER  May I have one of those, madam? GEORGE  Madame? What are you calling me madam for?  KRAMER  They're ladies' glasses.  (Kramer takes George's glasses and shows him the inside) KRAMER  Now look here, see it's right here: Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.  GEORGE  He sold me ladies' glasses! ELAINE  I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.  KRAMER  She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious.   (Elaine drinks some water and drools) KRAMER  She's foaming at the mouth!  (hospital) ELAINE  Is this gonna hurt? DOCTER  Yes, very much.  (Elaine gets the shot)  (Jerry's apartment) ELAINE  What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?  JERRY  Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.  ELAINE  Let me tell you this: there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!  JERRY  He does look like a horse. ELAINE  Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window:) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams:) Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!  DOG OWNER  Who are you calling stupid? JERRY  Hey, shall we spit on him? ELAINE  No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.   (Kramer enters the apartment) KRAMER  (Singing:) Oh myyyy papayaaaa.  (The air conditioner wobbles) KRAMER  The air conditioner!  (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps)  KRAMER  I think it got the dog!  (New York Health Club's locker room) GEORGE  Oh boy. BLIND MAN  Excuse me, I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker?  GEORGE  Oh uuh, sure, hang on. Hey, that's the guy.  BLIND MAN  What guy? GEORGE  The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em!   (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him)  GEORGE  Would you pick it up a little? BLIND MAN  Where the hell are we going? GEORGE  He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man:) Those are nice glasses.  BLIND MAN  I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose.  GEORGE  Is that really?  (J &amp; T Optical)  (George has taken the blind man with him) GEORGE  Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?  DWAYNE  (While eating a candy bar:) Yeah, we can do that.  GEORGE  And I'd like a discount. DWAYNE  Why should I give you a discount. GEORGE  Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a refund. You gave me ladies' frames!  BLIND MAN  What's that about ladies' frames?  (The man with the dog enters and the dog wears a collar) DOG OWNER  I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, the one that was messing with my dog.  GEORGE  Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.  DOG OWNER  Well I would love to talk with her. She lives on 81st Street, right?  GEORGE  No, that's Jerry. DOG OWNER  Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would you?  GEORGE  Yeah, 5A! DOG OWNER  Thanks a lot!  (in front of Jeffrey's apartment) AMY  So what are we doing here? JERRY  Oh, you'll find out. AMY  I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously.  JERRY  Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.   (Jerry knocks on the door) JERRY  A lot of women find that attractive.  AMY  I find it annoying. JERRY  Really?  (Uncle Leo opens the door) UNCLE LEO  Helloooo! JERRY  Uncle Leo! UNCLE LEO  Come on in. JERRY  This is Amy. UNCLE LEO  Hello Amy.

UNCLE LEO  He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets.  JERRY  Thank you. UNCLE LEO  Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that he's very sorry and he hopes you'll forgive 'em.  JERRY  (To Amy:) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!  AMY  What are you talking about, I don't know Jeffrey. Oh so this is why you brought me up here?  JERRY  Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.  UNCLE LEO  What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.  JERRY  Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?  (in front of J &amp; T Optical)  (George is walking with the blind man) GEORGE  Wait, these really do pinch the nose.   (George takes of his glasses) BLIND MAN  Tough luck! Deal's a deal. GEORGE  Oh my got it is them.  (George puts on his glasses again and sees it's a woman kissing a horse)   (New York Health Club locker room) JERRY  I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I've got to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.  GEORGE  Yeah. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...   (The camera shows George's glasses on top of his locker)   THE END>",

ELAINE  I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.  JERRY  Then, what was all that sniffing? ELAINE  Maybe it's the cold weather. JERRY  Today is not cold. GEORGE  All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting me.  ELAINE  Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.   Costanza's. George, Estelle and Frank are eating dinner. George is pounding a ketchup bottle.  FRANK  Why do you need all that ketchup for?  GEORGE  This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.  FRANK  So, I talked to Phil Casacof today.  ESTELLE  Phil Casacof? FRANK  Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.  GEORGE  Next Friday, what time? FRANK  2 o'clock. GEORGE  That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.  FRANK  You can look for sneakers the next day!  ESTELLE  He doesn't know anything about bras.  GEORGE  I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?  FRANK  Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.  ESTELLE  I am not giving him a bra. FRANK  Why not? ESTELLE  Because I don't need him looking at my bra.  FRANK  Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!  GEORGE  Do we have to...? FRANK  You don't even know what they're made from.  GEORGE  They are made from lycra-spandex. FRANK  Get out of here! Lycra-spandex? ESTELLE  I think they are made from lycra-spandex.  FRANK  Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?  ESTELLE  I'm not betting! FRANK  Take a look. ESTELLE  All right, I'll get a bra. FRANK  I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!  GEORGE  She doesn't want to get a bra. FRANK  I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.  GEORGE  All right, it wouldn't kill me. FRANK  How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the cup sizes and all? They have different cups.  GEORGE  I-I know about the cups. FRANK  You got the A, B, C the D. That's the biggest.  GEORGE  I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.  ESTELLE  Here, here's the bra. FRANK  Let me see it. FRANK  Let me see it. ESTELLE  I told you. Here, think you know everything?  FRANK  Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.  GEORGE  I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back.  ESTELLE  You got ketchup on it!  George takes his plate and the ketchup and leaves.  -  5A. Jerry and Kramer. KRAMER  Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?  JERRY  Sniffing, with his nose. KRAMER  Jerry, he probably had a cold. JERRY  No, I asked him. KRAMER  So, what are you saying? JERRY  I don't know, you know, what if...?  KRAMER  Drugs? You think he's on drugs? JERRY  I don't know. All I know he was sniffing.  KRAMER  Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together.  JERRY  I know. KRAMER  And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this guy. We trusted you.  JERRY  Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.  KRAMER  Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?  JERRY  No, he didn't use 'man'. KRAMER  I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ?  JERRY  No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.  KRAMER  Whoh! JERRY  Do you think that's a bad sign? KRAMER  Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?  JERRY  I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it?  KRAMER  Yeah.  Elaine's apartment. Jake is there and Elaine comes in. ELAINE  Hello.... hello, oh... JAKE  Well, you notice anything? ELAINE  You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man.   Jake feels Elaine's coat material. JAKE  Ooh... ELAINE  Did anyone call? JAKE  I got a few messages, I wrote them down.  ELAINE  Where are they? JAKE  Lets see, they are...here they are.  ELAINE  Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?  JAKE  She did. ELAINE  She did? Oh, that's so great! JAKE  Where do you keep the corkscrew? ELAINE  In the drawer on the right. Hmm...  JAKE  What? ELAINE  Oh it's nothing. JAKE  What is it? ELAINE  It's nothing. JAKE  Tell me. ELAINE  Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?  JAKE  What are you talking about? ELAINE  See, right here you wrote \"Myra had the baby\", but you didn't use an exclamation point.  JAKE  So? ELAINE  So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.  JAKE  What's so curious about it? ELAINE  Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.  JAKE  Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.  ELAINE  You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.  JAKE  Hey, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.  ELAINE  I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.  JAKE  Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.  ELAINE  Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!  JAKE  Well, you can put one on this one: I'm leaving!   5A. Jerry and Elaine JERRY  You're out of your mind you know that.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.  ELAINE  Well, I felt a call for one. JERRY  A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.  ELAINE  I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.  JERRY  George was right. Didn't take you long.   Kramer enters KRAMER  Anything new on that guy on drugs?  ELAINE  He's not on drugs. KRAMER  Then why the sniffing? Who walks around sniff, sniff sniffing?  ELAINE  All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.  JERRY  Good idea. VOICE ON THE PHONE  Prophet and Goldstein. JERRY  Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.  VOICE  I'm sorry he's out of town. JERRY  Out of town? VOICE  Yes, he went to South America. JERRY  South America? KRAMER  South America? JERRY  I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America!  KRAMER  Yyyeeaaah!! ELAINE  So what? JERRY  Who goes to South America? ELAINE  People go to South America. JERRY  Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.  ELAINE  So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?  JERRY  Yes, I'm impugning a continent. KRAMER  Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!   Newman enters NEWMAN  Hey, hey... JERRY  Hello Newman. NEWMAN  Hello Jerry. So, any news? KRAMER  Yeah, he skipped out and ptruut went to South America!  NEWMAN  South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us mixed up with?  ELAINE  Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.  KRAMER  Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.  ELAINE  What are you gonna do?

NEWMAN  If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.   -  Jerry, Kramer and Newman in the Saab KRAMER  What's today? NEWMAN  It's Thursday. KRAMER  Really? Feels like Tuesday. NEWMAN  Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....  KRAMER  I feel Tuesday and Wednesday... JERRY  All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.  NEWMAN  Hey, you know this is kind of fun.  KRAMER  Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...  JERRY  Yeah maybe you should. KRAMER  Maybe I will. NEWMAN  Yeah, me too. JERRY  All right, what are you gonna say to him?  KRAMER  Just gonna find out if he's interested.  NEWMAN  Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?

KRAMER  Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?  BARRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things.   Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head KRAMER  Cigarette? BARRY  No, I never touch them. KRAMER  I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time.   Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time   Barry sniffs KRAMER  Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh?  BARRY  I don't think so. KRAMER  Me neither.  Kramer puts the cigarette wrong way to his mouth  Back in the car with Jerry and Newman. JERRY  You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.  NEWMAN  I use dental tape. JERRY  You should try this. NEWMAN  I don't wanna. JERRY  Not even once? NEWMAN  No. JERRY  You're an idiot. NEWMAN  Why, because I use dental tape? JERRY  Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.   Back in the bar. KRAMER  South America? BARRY  Yeah, yeah. KRAMER  That's importuning(?) continent. BARRY  They are expanding their economic base.  KRAMER  Tell me about it. BARRY  Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.  KRAMER  I'm hip. BARRY  Hip to the what? KRAMER  To the whole scene. sniff BARRY  What scene? KRAMER  The bathroom scene. sniff, sniff BARRY  Listen, don't take this personally, but when I'm coming back I'm sitting over there.   Back in the car. Newman takes a dental floss out of his mouth.  NEWMAN  No, no I don't like it. JERRY  What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?  NEWMAN  I like the thick tape.  Newman puts dental floss on the dashboard. Jerry looks disgusted.   The bar. Kramer enters the bathroom, kicks the door open and takes a photograph.  BARRY  Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you?   George's job interview. FARKUS  So, basically the job here is quite simple. Selling bras.  GEORGE  Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.  FARKUS  Have you ever sold a woman's line before?  GEORGE  No, but I have very good repute with women, very good, top form. And the first time I laid my I on brassieres I was enthralled.  FARKUS  Hum. tell me about it. GEORGE  Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod. I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres.  FARKUS  That's incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres.  GEORGE  They are more than an underwear to me Mr.Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?  FARKUS  Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you'll have a very bright future here at ED Granmont.  GEORGE  Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed.  FARKUS  See you monday 9 o'clock. GEORGE  If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.  FARKUS  Excellent. GEORGE  So long, Mr. Farkus.  George leaves the office and goes to the elevator.

LIPPMAN  I was just going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely.  ELAINE  Yes, krhm, yes I did. LIPPMAN  And, anyway I was just reading your final edit, um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.  ELAINE  Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.  LIPPMAN  Oh, \"It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!\"  ELAINE  Right, well... LIPPMAN  You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?  ELAINE  That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...  LIPPMAN  I see, \"I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!\" Exclamation point?  ELAINE  Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then prrt nothing comes out...  LIPPMAN  Get rid of the exclamation points...  ELAINE  Ok, ok ok ... LIPPMAN  I hate exclamation points... ELAINE  ...ok I'll just....  --  5A. Jerry, Kramer, Newman writing a letter. Elaine reads on the couch.  JERRY  'Dear Barry.

KRAMER  I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.  JERRY  Mohair, I think. RALPH  Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair.  JERRY  You mean you just started sniffing?  RALPH  Yeah, mohair does it to me every time.   Ralph leaves JERRY  I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.  KRAMER  Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.  ELAINE  The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! I told you he wasn't a drug addict.  JERRY  Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!

Newman rushes away dropping the letter on the ground.  Costanza's FRANK  What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?  GEORGE  So what, what is so bad about that?  ESTELLE  Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained feeling a person's material? It's insanity!  FRANK  What ever happened to \"Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?\"!!   At the cafe. Kramer and Elaine. ELAINE  You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.  JERRY  Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.  ELAINE  What is this? JERRY  It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.  ELAINE  He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?  JERRY  Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!  ELAINE  What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.  KRAMER  All right, What about the money? JERRY  What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I   would've done, if for certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!   Newman enters and goes to the counter. NEWMAN  Pair of bear claws, please.  Jerry approaches Newman, but some women comes between and feels Jerry's shirt.  WOMAN  Nice. JERRY  Think so? WOMAN  Yeah, what is it? JERRY  Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?

(LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES,          MUTTERING) How do you find a     mohel? Motels, models..   JERRY     Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece          of cake. Any idiot can find a     Mohel. I have the tough job. I          have to hold the baby while they     do it. How would you like that          job?   ELAINE     Have you ever seen one?   JERRY     You mean that wasn't -   ELAINE     Yeah.   JERRY     No.. you?   ELAINE     Ya.   JERRY     What'd you think?   ELAINE     (SHAKES HER HEAD) No...   JERRY     Not good?   ELAINE     No, had no face, no personality,          very dull. It was like a     martian. But hey, that's me.   JERRY     Hey.   GEORGE ENTERS WITH ESTIMATE.   GEORGE     Well I just got the estimate. It's          going to cost more to fix that     roof than the car's worth, So I'm          gonna go see the hospital     administrator today. Someone's          paying for that damage and it's     not gonna be me.   JERRY     Ah, you're screwed.   GEORGE     I know, swan dives from twenty          floors, lands right on to it. What     do I have a bulls eye on there?          He couldn't move over two feet?     Land on the sidewalk. That's city          property.     What are the chances, what are          the odds? He couldn't do it again     if his life depended on it...   ELAINE     Well I have to interview a Mohel.   JERRY     Oh, poor ELAINE. Look at her. Attended          the finest finishing     schools on the Eastern seaboard.          Equestrian competitions.     Debutante balls. Well, look at          you now. Interviewing Mohels.   SUDDENLY, KRAMER ENTERS, HOLDING          THE PAPER, EXPLODES WITH A SPASM   OF REVELATION.   JERRY     What's the matter?   ELAINE     Are you alright?   KRAMER     Don't even question my instincts,          because my instincts are honed.     (RE:PAPER) Look at that.   JERRY     What now?   HE SHOWS JERRY THE PAPER   JERRY (CONT'D)     \"Hospital receives grant to conduct          DNA research\"..\" Government     funds genetic research at area          hospital\" ... Yeah, so?   KRAMER     Pigman, baby. Pigman.   ELAINE     Oh, if I hear about this pigman          one more time...   KRAMER     I'm tellin ya the pigman is alive.          The governments been     experimenting with pigmen since          the fifties.   JERRY     Will you stop it. Just because          a hospital gets a grant to study     DNA doesn't mean they are creating          a race of mutant pigmen.   KRAMER     Oh. JERRY wake up to reality. It's          military thing. They're     probably creating a whole army          of pig warriors.   GEORGE     I wish there were pigmen. You get          a few of these pigmen walking     around I'm looking a whole lot          better. Then if somebody wants          to     fix me up at least they could say,          \"Hey he's no pig-man!\"   JERRY     Believe me, there'd be plenty of          women going for the pig-men. No     matter what the deformity you'll          find some group of perverts     attracted to it. \"Oo that little          tail turns me on.\"   ELAINE GROANS AND HEADS FOR THE          DOOR.   ELAINE     (MUMBLES) Alright, that's about          enough   JERRY     Oh, what's the matter you're not          interested in this?   ELAINE     No, it's fascinating, could you          do me a favor, could you tape the     rest of the pigmen and the women          who love them discussion and     I'll listen to it next time I'm          here. I've got to find a Mohel.   KRAMER     You should call this off, ELAINE.          It's a barbaric ritual.   ELAINE     Perhaps one day when the pigmen          roam free it will be stopped.     Until then, off with their heads.   ELAINE LEAVES.   GEORGE     But KRAMER, isn't it a question          of hygiene?   KRAMER     Oh, that's a myth. Besides, you          know, it makes sex more     pleasurable.   GEORGE     Yeah. So how does that help me?   JERRY     (TO GEORGE) Hey GEORGE, have you          ever seen one?   GEORGE     Yeah, my roommate in college.   JERRY     So what'd you think?   GEORGE     I got used to it.   DISSOLVE TO:      ACT ONE   SCENE G   (JERRY, GEORGE, KRAMER)   INT.

KRAMER     Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show          him to you, and you'll never be     the same.   JERRY     Maybe he's just a guy with a nose          like this. You know a lot of     people have a nose like this, they're          not necessarily pig-men.   KRAMER     Believe me, JERRY, somewhere in          this hospital the anguished oink     of pigman cries for help.   JERRY     If I hear an anguished oink, I'm          outta here.   KRAMER     I can't let this go on.   JERRY     Let me understand this. So if you          find the pigman, your intention     is to ...emancipate him?   KRAMER     That's right. (CALLING OUT)     Sue-wee!   JERRY     KRAMER! well I don't see any pig-men.          Look (HE POINTS AT     PASSERBY) Human, human, human...   HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.

I'll meet you guys     by the car.   KRAMER     You got room for the pig-man?   GEORGE     The pig-man can take the bus.   KRAMER     You know, if pig-man had a car,          he'd give you a ride.   GEORGE     How do you know? What if Pigman          had a two-seater?   KRAMER     Come on GEORGE, be realistic.   GEORGE     All right, if pig-man comes along,          we'll squeeze him in.

SWEEDLER,          USHERS GEORGE IN. THEY SIT ON   EITHER SIDE OF HER DESK.   MRS. SWEEDLER     Mr. Costanza, come in, come in.          It's been a very trying couple          of     days around the hospital. Patients,          doctors, everyone, just grief     stricken over this unfortunate          occurrence.   GEORGE     Well, I join them in their grief.     Mrs. Sweedler     Horrible, just a horrible thing.          Flew right past the children's     wing. All the sick children, in          the playroom, looking out the     window, just traumatize by the          incident. Apparently, they all     thought he was flying. You know          how children are, \"Oh look. A man     is flying. A man is flying\" And          then, splat...   GEORGE     Yes, splat. Exactly. Splat. That's          where I come in. On splat. You     see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital          administrator Sweedler?     Mrs. Sweedler     Mrs. Sweedler's fine.   GEORGE     You see, that trudge affected me          in a very, very personal way.     Mrs. SWEEDLER     How is that?   GEORGE     Yes, you see, the deceased landed          on my car. The splat, as it     were, actually took place on the          roof of my car. I can't help but     think that had it been a convertible          this whole tragedy may have     been averted but I've never been          the type to buy a convertible,     what with the baldness and all.     Mrs. SWEEDLER     Well I've known bald men who owned          convertibles. They wore a hat.   GEORGE     Well then it's all pulled down.          Anyway. The damage,     unfortunately, has marred an otherwise          fine automobile, rendering     it virtually undriveable.     Mrs. SWEEDLER     (STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is          a shame.   GEORGE     Yes, a shame. That's just how I          would describe it. Now, with all     due sensitivity and discretion,          bearing in mind the scope of the     situation, I can't help but think          the hospital bears some     responsibility to compensate the          other, still living \"victim\", of     this horrendous, horrendous tragedy.   SHE GLARES     Mrs.Sweedler     Mr.Constanza.   GEORGE     Yes.     Mrs. SWEEDLER     A man plummeted tragically to his          ultimate demise -   GEORGE     Yes.     Mrs. SWEEDLER     ... and you greedily, callously          try to profit from it.   GEORGE   (PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS          POCKET)     Well, profit. I think you'll see          from the estimates that I'm not     really profiting that much. They          might be a little high, but..     Mrs. SWEEDLER     (WITH ANGER) How dare you.   GEORGE     What?     Mrs. SWEEDLER     Have you no decency? Have you no          shame?   GEORGE     Yes.. you know, depending.     Mrs. SWEEDLER     Get out! Get out, now! get out          of my office.   GEORGE PUTS HIS ESTIMATES ON THE          DESK AND BEGINS TO EXIT.   GEORGE     Should I leave these with you?     Mrs. SWEEDLER     Get out!

You'll just need          a few stitches.   JERRY     Stitches? I've never had stitched.          I'll be deformed. I can't live     with that. It goes against my whole          personality. It's not me!   GEORGE     Hey look a this - boy are you lucky          - another spot - right in     front of the hospital. In an emergency          yet! How lucky is that? Is     that unbelievable?

        "text": "   THE LIP READER Written by   Carol Leifer   (Comedy club) JERRY  Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. \"That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh.\"   (Commercial)  In the bleachers at the tennis court. Two players are hitting the ball back and forth.  JERRY  Are these seats unbelievable or what?  GEORGE  Where's the sunblock? JERRY  Here. GEORGE  25? You don't have anything higher?  JERRY  What, are you on Mercury? GEORGE  I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.  JERRY  You got a problem with paba? GEORGE  Yes, I have a problem with paba. JERRY  You don't even know what paba is. GEORGE  I know enough to stay away from it.  GEORGE  So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?  JERRY  I'll go if someone else drives. You going?  GEORGE  Gwen really wants to go. JERRY  You're bringing a date to a party?  GEORGE  No good? JERRY  A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.  GEORGE  Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?  JERRY  Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.  GEORGE  Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.  JERRY  That woman is absolutely stunning.  GEORGE  The Croat? (the tennis player) JERRY  Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.  GEORGE  Yeah, she's a B.L. JERRY  B.L.? GEORGE  Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?   At Elaine's office. COWORKER  You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out.  ELAINE  You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?  COWORKER  Take a car service. We have an account.  ELAINE  Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.  COWORKER  Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down.  ELAINE  I guess that could work.  At the tennis court concession stand. George is eating a sundae.   At Jerry's apartment. Kramer is watching TV. ANNOUNCER  And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Comming up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop.  KRAMER  Hey, hey, it's George.  George is on TV eating a sundae. His face is covered in ice cream and fudge. He is taking a bite of ice cream and dripping it around his mouth.  ANNOUNCER  Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can cover a lot of court. Hey buddy, they got a new invention. It's called a napkin. We'll take a station break and continue with more...   Elaine in the car service car. DRIVER  Dag Gavershole Plaza (sp?) huh? (Elaine ignores him) Pendant Publishing, that's books right? (Elaine is annoyed and still ignoring him) Miss?  ELAINE  Pardon me? DRIVER  Books, that's what you do? ELAINE  Yeah. DRIVER  Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, but not me. You know what I do?  ELAINE  You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...  DRIVER  (Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey do you make a book of Jumbles?  ELAINE  I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.  DRIVER  Going deaf? ELAINE  What? DRIVER  Oh I'm sorry. ELAINE  It can be very frustrating. DRIVER  Hey what about a hearing aid? ELAINE  An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.  DRIVER  No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. (Elaine looks pleased)   At the tennis court. JERRY  I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman is absolutely mesmerizing.  GEORGE  Boy you are really smitten. JERRY  I gotta talk to her. What do you think?  GEORGE  Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.  JERRY  I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.  GEORGE  They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.  JERRY  I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.  GEORGE  Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.  JERRY  I can't. GEORGE  What are you going to say? JERRY  I don't know, \"Hi\". GEORGE  You think you're going to the other side with \"Hi\"? You're not going to make it.   Elaine in the car service car. RADIO  Base to 92 come in DRIVER  Yes this is 92 RADIO  After this go back to city for a 6:00 pickup  DRIVER  Righteo RADIO  794 Bleeker the party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.  ELAINE  Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.  DRIVER  So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?  ELAINE  Yeah. Yes it does... DRIVER  Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.  ELAINE  No no, no no. DRIVER  Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior.   At the tennis court. Jerry is standing behind the lineswoman.  JERRY  Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?  LAURA  Bingo.  At Jerry's apartment. KRAMER  And you're saying she's deaf. JERRY  I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.  KRAMER  Can't hear a thing. JERRY  Can't hear a thing. KRAMER  And you're going to go out with her.  JERRY  Yeah, isn't that something?  Elaine enters. ELAINE  Hey. JERRY AND KRAMER  Hey. KRAMER  Hey I know how to sign. JERRY  Really? KRAMER  Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.  ELAINE  What is this about? JERRY  I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.  ELAINE  You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.  JERRY  Wow good plan. ELAINE  Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.  JERRY AND KRAMER  No. ELAINE  No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say \"get out of here\". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.  JERRY  That's nice. ELAINE  Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.  JERRY  That's nice for the freaks. ELAINE  Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?  JERRY  Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket area.  KRAMER  Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.  ELAINE  Oh, thanks Kramer. KRAMER  You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.  JERRY  Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.  ELAINE  Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.  KRAMER  Well there ought to be ball men. JERRY  All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier.  ELAINE  Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.  KRAMER  Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream.)   At Monk's. GWEN  I'm sorry George. GEORGE  I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.  GWEN  It's not you, it's me. GEORGE  You're giving me the \"it's not you, it's me\" routine? I invented \"it's not you, it's me\". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.  GWEN  All right, George, it's you. GEORGE  You're *damn* right it's me. GWEN  I was just trying to... GEORGE  I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.  GWEN  I'm sure you do it very well. GEORGE  Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.   George then looks confused like what he said just didn't sound right.   At Jerry's apartment. JERRY  But I thought things were going great.  GEORGE  Yeah so did I. JERRY  Did she say why? GEORGE  No. She tried to give me the \"it's not you, it's me\" routine.  JERRY  But that's your routine. GEORGE  Yeah. Well aparently word's out.  Kramer enters. KRAMER  Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday.  GEORGE  Really? At the tennis match? KRAMER  Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.  GEORGE  Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.  KRAMER  Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.  GEORGE  Cracks? What were they saying? KRAMER  That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.  GEORGE  Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.  KRAMER  Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.  GEORGE  She must have seen me eating it on TV.  JERRY  So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?  GEORGE  Why not. I would be.  The phone rings. JERRY  Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.  GEORGE  You're parents saw me on TV? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?  KRAMER  It felt like 8 seconds. GEORGE  One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.   Elaine enters. ELAINE  I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?  GEORGE  Can we move on? JERRY  He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.  ELAINE  Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.  GEORGE  Yes I do. ELAINE  So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.  GEORGE  Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.  KRAMER  Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.  JERRY  Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite?  KRAMER  Excellent question. JERRY  I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.  ELAINE  I beg to differ. JERRY  Really. ELAINE  He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.  JERRY  Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.  ELAINE  Well we can take the car service from my office.  JERRY  Really? ELAINE  Yeah, they don't know. KRAMER  All right, I'll see you later. JERRY  Okay. GEORGE  \"To the victor goes the spoils.\" What are you going to do tonight?  JERRY  Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.  GEORGE  Oh. (he stands there) JERRY  Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?  GEORGE  Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want to tag along with you or anything.  JERRY  Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?  GEORGE  Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?   At a Chinese restaurant. GEORGE  So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.  LAURA  They never have napkins there. JERRY  Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.  LAURA  Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up.  GEORGE  They're breaking up? How do you know?  JERRY  She reads lips. GEORGE  What are they saying now? LAURA  \"It's not you, it's me.\" GEORGE  (Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.  JERRY  (Puts his hand over his mouth) What?  GEORGE  (Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.  JERRY  (Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.  GEORGE  (Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.  JERRY  (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.  GEORGE  (Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.  JERRY  (Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.  JERRY  Uh Laura, George was wondering if...  LAURA  Sure. I'll do it.  After the restaurant. Jerry at Laura's place. JERRY  So I really had a good time. LAURA  Yeah, me too. JERRY  So you want to go to the party on Friday night?  LAURA  Yeah. JERRY  All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?   (Commercial)  At the tennis court. MAN  Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.  BOY  Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?  KRAMER  I may be old, but I'm spry. BOY  The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it?  KRAMER  Oh I'll be up for it punk.  Kramer fetches some balls, and he is doing some pretty fancy footwork.   At Jerry's apartment. JERRY  See I was saying \"six\" but she thought I was saying \"sex\". We straightened the whole thing out though.  GEORGE  She confused \"six\" with \"sex\"? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Well if she can't tell \"six\" from \"sex\" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?  JERRY  Well \"six\" and \"sex\" are close. GEORGE  It's two completely different sounds. \"ih\" and \"eh\".  JERRY  Eh. GEORGE  It seems like a problem. JERRY  Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.   Kramer enters. KRAMER  Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.  JERRY  You're kidding. KRAMER  Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.  GEORGE  When is that car service comming? JERRY  In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.  GEORGE  If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.  JERRY  I know. It's like X-ray vision. GEORGE  If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.   Newman enters. NEWMAN  I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.  JERRY  Can't do it Newman. NEWMAN  But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.  JERRY  Not going to happen. NEWMAN  (Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.   In the car service car. JERRY  Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.  DRIVER  Pardon me sir? JERRY  I said pull over by the stop sign.  DRIVER  I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something.  KRAMER  -ca. DRIVER  Huh? GEORGE  What? JERRY  ca. GEORGE  ah. DRIVER  My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.   Elaine gets in. The driver looks up and notices her. He gets angry.   A moment later, the group gets out of the car. DRIVER  Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.   Kramer shuts the door and the car takes off, squeeling the tires.   At the party. JERRY  You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.   Laura sees the group and gets up. She points to her watch. JERRY  I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.   Kramer and Laura start signing to each other. We see confusion from them as they are signing. George puts his forhead on his hand.  KRAMER  She doesn't know what she's talking about.  TODD  Guys you made it. GEORGE  Hey hey. TODD  Sorry to hear about Gwen. GEORGE  Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?  TODD  Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her. Look George, I'm friends with both of you. I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything.  GEORGE  I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.  TODD  You are so centered. GEORGE  (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?   Gwen and Todd talk. Laura makes hand signs and Kramer translates.  KRAMER  \"Hi Gwen, hi tide.\" JERRY  Hi tide? KRAMER  Hi Todd. KRAMER  \"You've got something between your teeth\"  GEORGE  What? KRAMER  No that's what he said. \"That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup.\" So do I.  ELAINE  She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?  JERRY  No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.  GWEN  I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.  TODD  Maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together.  KRAMER  \"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together.\"  GEORGE  What? KRAMER  \"You want me to sleep with you?\" TODD  I don't want to sweep alone. KRAMER  He says \"I don't want to sleep alone.\" She says, oh boy, \"love to.\"   George walks across the room over to them. GEORGE  So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?  GWEN  What? You're crazy. KRAMER  \"What? You're crazy.\" GEORGE  I heard your whole conversation. GWEN  How? KRAMER  \"How?\" GEORGE  (looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.  GWEN  No I didn't. I said \"sweep\". Let's sweep together, you know with a broom. Cleaning up.  KRAMER  \"... with a broom, cleaning up.\" GEORGE  Sweep? GWEN  Yes sweep. KRAMER  \"Yes sweep.\" GEORGE  Cut it. KRAMER  George says \"Cut it.\" GEORGE  Cut it. KRAMER  George is saying \"Cut it.\" GEORGE  Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing? She said \"sweep together\" you idiots, not \"sleep together.\"   Laura's mouth is wide open. She looks at Kramer and points to George. She is mad at Kramer. Aparently she did say sweep and Kramer mis-translated. She signs to Kramer.  KRAMER  I know how to sign.  Kramer and Laura are arguing back and forth with sign language. They are gesturing signs fiercely. One of Laura's signs causes her hand to swing backwards and hit George in the face.  GEORGE  Ow. My eye, my eye.  (At the tennis court) ELAINE  It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in the finals.  JERRY  I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.   Kramer is sitting poised on the sideline. He waves back to the group. George and Elaine gives him a thumbs up. The two players hit the ball back and forth. The ball lands in the net. Kramer springs into action running toward the ball and runs into Monica Sellas. Monica falls to the ground in pain.  JERRY  Thus ends the great ball man experiment.   Laura gets into the car service car. DRIVER  You with the tennis center? LAURA  Yep. DRIVER  Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Sellas. Wasn't that something.   Laura. I'm deaf. DRIVER  Oh. (Very suspicious look on his face.)  THE END>",

Unless the waiter's not too sharp, then you got to total   it up. Sometimes they have to come over, \"Do you want the  check?\" \"No, I want to be pen pals. Can't you see what I'm  doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.\" ELAINE  Hmm! GEORGE  Fantastic! JERRY  I told you. How good is this? GEORGE  Good. JERRY  How good? GEORGE  Very good. ELAINE  They got blue berries. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get? JERRY  Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and they put it in. ELAINE  Let me test-taste that. JERRY  Huh? Huh? ELAINE  Hmm! Rico! JERRY  Suave! And it's non-fat! GEORGE  See, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.  ELAINE  You want to taste mine? GEORGE  Oh, you want to taste mine. ELAINE  No, I don't. GEORGE  Okay, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours. ELAINE  All right, let's just forget it. JERRY  You know, Kramer's going to clean up on this place.  GEORGE  What do you mean? JERRY  He invested in it. GEORGE  No kidding? JERRY  Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so *beep*ing good. LADY  Jerry! JERRY  Oh, I'm sorry. ELAINE  All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay? GEORGE  Oh, god. Look who's here. JERRY  Who is it? GEORGE  This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd: Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool. JERRY  Oh, really? LLOYD  Hey, George! GEORGE  Hey! Lloyd! My friend Jerry. LLOYD  So, I hear you're living back home now?  GEORGE  Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.  LLOYD  Fire! Whoa! There's a lot of major chicks in this place, huh? Something wrong with your arm? GEORGE  Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I bumped my elbow on a desk and injured something. And now it sort of moves  involuntarily. LLOYD  Wow, that's a bitch, huh? LLOYD  So, how are your parents doing? GEORGE  Oh, pretty good. LLOYD  This place does some business, huh?  GEORGE  Yeah, this is my first time here. LLOYD  Hey, she's a doll. ELAINE  Hi! GEORGE  Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd. ELAINE  Hi! LLOYD  Oh, hi! Very nice to meet you. ELAINE  Nice to meet you, too! LLOYD  Well, I'm really sorry I got to run now. Well, take it easy, huh, George? GEORGE  Yeah! Yeah. ELAINE  Boy, he is really cute! GEORGE  He's a jerk. JERRY  He's gone, George. GEORGE  All right. All right. KRAMER  So, there were a lot of people there, huh?  JERRY  Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.  KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  They're doing an incredible business.  KRAMER  Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.  JERRY  How did you know? KRAMER  Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat. JERRY  Yeah? ELAINE  Buzz me. JERRY  Oh. Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes. KRAMER  Yeah, but did you tape it? JERRY  Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your  feet up? KRAMER  Yes! JERRY  I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.  ELAINE  Hey! KRAMER  Hey! JERRY  What's the matter? ELAINE  Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.  JERRY  Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that. KRAMER  Yow! ELAINE  What? KRAMER  Well, you're getting heavy. Yeah, you look like you put on five, ten pounds. JERRY  Kramer! KRAMER  I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy. JERRY  Me? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  No. ELAINE  Where's your bathroom scale? Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds. JERRY  I've gained eight. KRAMER  I told you. ELAINE  Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds? JERRY  How did I gain eight? ELAINE  I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different. JERRY  Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt. KRAMER  No, no, no. That's hundred percent yogurt.  JERRY  Well, how else could this have happened?  KRAMER  Well, maybe it's the Oreos. ELAINE  I don't eat Oreos. KRAMER  You don't eat Oreos? The way you break them open? You're ~ practically having sex with them. JERRY  What about me? KRAMER  You? You're getting old. JERRY  Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.  KRAMER  Oh, guess again, Tubby! ELAINE  Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.  JERRY  There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing. ELAINE  Gasp! I've got it. KRAMER  What? ELAINE  I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.  KRAMER  Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubby, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week. JERRY  Well, let's start the insanity. KRAMER  Giddy-up!  Dad Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. You ever see Tommy  Tune dancing? GEORGE  No. MOM  I like tap dancing.  Dad Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.  MOM  Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.  GEORGE  What's for supper? MOM  Somebody's at the door.  Dad Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.  MOM  Lloyd? LLOYD  Hello, Mrs. Costanza. MOM  Georgie, Lloyd: Braun is here.  Dad Hey! Lloyd! MOM  What are you doing here? LLOYD  Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother, and so I thought I'd drop by and say, \"Hello\". MOM  Georgie. Come here and say hello.  Dad How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for   Dinkins now. LLOYD  That's right. Hey, George. GEORGE  Hey, Lloyd. How's it going? LLOYD  I ran into George: yesterday in the city.  MOM  Ow! What's the matter with you? LLOYD  So, uh, how's the arm, huh? GEORGE  Oh, it's good. It's good. MOM  What's the matter with your arm? GEORGE  Nothing. LLOYD  Oh, his arm moves like this.  Dad Your arm moves like this? GEORGE  Yeah.  Dad I never seen your arm move like this. MOM  Me, either. GEORGE  Well, it comes and goes.  Dad It's like some kind of a spasm. LLOYD  Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. So, I made an appointment for  you. Dr. Dekter. MOM  Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?   Dad You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You DISCUSSED GEORGE  with the mayor of New York? MOM  Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.  GEORGE  You know, Lloyd, I've been to the doctor - there's really nothing they can do.  Dad Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what  kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him? GEORGE  All right. All right. I'll go. LLOYD  Well, that's great. And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis. ELAINE  Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have   to drive there. JERRY  And they said they can do it? ELAINE  Yeah, it's forty-five bucks. JERRY  All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen. ELAINE  Hm-hmm.  Lady Well, I hope you're satisfied. JERRY  What?  Lady Every word out of my son's mouth now is *beep*, *beep*,   *beep*. You know what he said to me five minutes ago?  Where's my *beep*ing cupcake? JERRY  Gee, I'm really sorry.  Lady He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe   you could talk to him? JERRY  I'd be happy to.  Lady Thank you. JERRY  Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?  Lady No *beep*ing way! LLOYD  Well, it was very nice seeing you again.  MOM  Oh, it was good seeing you. LLOYD  Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day? GEORGE  Oh, uh, just a friend of mine. MOM  You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?  LLOYD  She is. She is. How about giving me her number?  GEORGE  Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.  MOM  She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine: Benice.  LLOYD  Oh, great. Thanks a lot! GEORGE  Yeah! LLOYD  So long. MOM  Bye! Oh, that Lloyd: Braun. He is something, isn't he?   Newman Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, \"Nice try, granny!\" And I sent her to the back of the line! JERRY  Hello, Newman.  Newman Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my  whole life! And it's finally here!  Owner Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities   around my son, huh? JERRY  It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.  ELAINE  I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?  Owner That's right. ELAINE  'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.  Owner Yeah, well, there is no fat.  Newman Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.  ELAINE  Hurry, Jerry! Hurry! JERRY  How's it doing? ELAINE  Not too good. KRAMER  Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.  JERRY  So what. KRAMER  It changes the molecules. JERRY  Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.  KRAMER  Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.  JERRY  You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back. ELAINE  Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.   Labbie Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please? ELAINE  Yeah. Oh, does it matter if it's melted?   Labbie No! You know, this is going to take a couple of days.  ELAINE  That's okay. KRAMER  Hello, there. LABBETTE  Hello! KRAMER  Ooh! Test tubes. Cool! JERRY  What do you got there?  Labbie Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a   cholesterol work up on it. JERRY  Oh. ELAINE  Okay, I'm done. LABBETTE  It was really nice meeting you. KRAMER  Well, the pleasure's all mine. JERRY  You can't take that chemist out. KRAMER  Why not? JERRY  Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.  KRAMER  I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.  JERRY  Well, I think the whole thing stinks.  ELAINE  It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.  JERRY  That's enough. ELAINE  What? JERRY  Well, with the smells. GEORGE  So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me. JERRY  Uh-huh. GEORGE  And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.  JERRY  Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? He's going to think you're a mental patient. GEORGE  I don't care. Look, Lloyd: doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. My whole life is a lie. ELAINE  Hey!  G&amp;J Hey. ELAINE  So, guess who called me. GEORGE  Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd? ELAINE  We're going out tomorrow night. GEORGE  Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving  involuntarily ever since. ELAINE  I can't say that. GEORGE  Why not? ELAINE  What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?  GEORGE  So, you're taking his side? ELAINE  No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us. GEORGE  Already you're marrying this guy? ELAINE  You never know. GEORGE  All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.  ELAINE  All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around  going like this? Even you can't keep that up. JERRY  No, I believe he can.  Lady Hi! JERRY  Hi!  Lady You know Jerry.  Son Of course, he's the funny *beep*er.  Lady See! JERRY  Listen, Matthew, I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.  Son You did it. JERRY  That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue  cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you  grow up. Excuse me one second. ELAINE  You know, Lloyd: advises Dinkins on everything he does.  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. Big advisor. ELAINE  He tells him which soap to use. JERRY  What the *beep* are you doing? You little piece of *beep*.  LABBETTE  Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.  KRAMER  Where's the lights. Whoa! LABBETTE  How about this? KRAMER  Yeah! Bunsen burner. You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.  LABBETTE  It's delicious. KRAMER  I hear you. LABBETTE  Non-fat? KRAMER  Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?  LABBETTE  No. KRAMER  Well, this is in case there's a tie!  ELAINE  Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this involuntarily movement. Some sort of a   spasm. So, anyway, you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh? LLOYD  Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.  ELAINE  Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody  should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.  LLOYD  Name tags, hmm? ELAINE  Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town. LLOYD  Maybe I'll mention that to him. ELAINE  Really? Wow! LLOYD  You sure you don't want any yogurt?  ELAINE  No, I'm watching my weight. LLOYD  Well, it's nonfat. ELAINE  Yeah, so they say. LLOYD  Well, should we go? ELAINE  Yeah. Okay. ELAINE  Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat. JERRY  He said that? ELAINE  No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on  one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, \"Boy, you're a   lot of woman!\" KRAMER  Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?  JERRY  No, but I expect to hear anytime. KRAMER  Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.  JERRY  Why do you say that? KRAMER  No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?  ELAINE  No. What about him? KRAMER  You didn't hear? ELAINE  Un-huh. KRAMER  He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags. JERRY  Name tags? KRAMER  Yeah! So people can go around saying \"hello\" to one another.  JERRY  Oh, I see. So you can go, \"Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!\" KRAMER  He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. Name tags! JERRY  Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. Well, the yogurt verdict is in. Fat! KRAMER  Yeow! GEORGE  The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, oh! DOCTOR  Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.  GEORGE  Please, doctor. DOCTOR  I've examined you. GEORGE  Yes. DOCTOR  I've looked at your X-rays. GEORGE  Uh-huh. DOCTOR  And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.  GEORGE  Hmm. Really? Nothing? DOCTOR  Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms.  GEORGE  Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?  DOCTOR  No, not really. GEORGE  How so? DOCTOR  May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?  GEORGE  Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's  absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person  would do a thing like that? DOCTOR  I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person.   A person who has no regard for wasting other people's  valuable time. Good-bye. GEORGE  Now, see here, doctor. DOCTOR  I said, good-bye. GEORGE  Fine. Ow! ELAINE  Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.  JERRY  Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey,  look, wait a second, Kramer, turn that up. KRAMER  Okay. NEWS  Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today when his cholesterol count turned   out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the   minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another  development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd   Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag  fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy   Giuliani is about to make a statement. GIULIANI  It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I  exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that   I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat. JERRY  Yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it. ELAINE  Now look what you've done. JERRY  Well, we've got to do something. I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters. GEORGE  Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.  Dad I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags.   Everyone would be a lot friendlier. \"Hello, Sam.\" \"How are  you doing, Joe?\" Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought  you said it went away. GEORGE  I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. And . . .  MOM  Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.   Giuliani My campaign staff has received some very disturbing   information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being   sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm  elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a   special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you,   my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do  everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat   yogurt. JERRY  The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.  GEORGE  Phew! ELAINE  Oh, it stinks. KRAMER  Mine, too. I got one more day. JERRY  I can't eat this.  Newman Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy. JERRY  It had fat in it, it's not good for you.   Newman I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to   interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get   even with you for this. You can count on it. ELAINE  Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his   cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially   reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt   scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the   election for the Republican. It was the one issue which  seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.  JERRY  So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.  ELAINE  I wonder what actually happened in that lab.  KRAMER  Yeah, me, too.  Newman I can't eat this. BOY  Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*!   THE END>",

We   have a small but prestigious group of clients. GEORGE  Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.  MR. TUTTLE  That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little   thing to you. You understand everything immediately. GEORGE  I enjoy understanding. MR. TUTTLE  I want you to have this job. Of course...  SECRETARY  Mr. Zimmer is on line 2. MR. TUTTLE  Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in.   (commercial)  At Monk's GEORGE  I want you to have this job. Of course...  JERRY  Yeah? GEORGE  That's it. JERRY  What do you mean that's it? GEORGE  He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.  JERRY  \"Of course\" was the last thing he said?  GEORGE  Maybe he was going to say \"Of course I have to check with my associates.\"  ELAINE  \"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be   serving time.\" JERRY  \"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.\"  GEORGE  All right. ELAINE  Why don't you go ahead and call him?  GEORGE  Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what   impressed him. JERRY  So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.  GEORGE  And if I don't call... JERRY  You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?  GEORGE  Rest stop supply.  Kramer comes in and sits down. KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey. JERRY  Shower? KRAMER  Haircut. JERRY  Who'd you use? Gino? KRAMER  Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.  ELAINE  What butcher? KRAMER  The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.  JERRY  Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.  ELAINE  You never get good haircuts. KRAMER  You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.  JERRY  Really? ELAINE  Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor   auction. KRAMER  What bachelor auction? ELAINE  Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.  KRAMER  And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.  JERRY  I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.  KRAMER  Polio? ELAINE  Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.  JERRY  Okay. KRAMER  What are you all dressed up for? GEORGE  I had a job interview. KRAMER  Yeah. How'd it go? GEORGE  Good. Of course...  At the barber shop ENZO  Oh Jerry. JERRY  Oh hi Enzo. ENZO  Oh, you've come for the haircut. JERRY  No, actually I was just... ENZO  It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been   with me for so long. You're so loyal. JERRY  Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)  ENZO  (He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to get away but can't.) Eh, what's the difference.   It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you.  JERRY  Well I don't want to take too much off.  ENZO  Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair.  MAN  Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.   At Jerry's apartment.  Jerry is sitting down on the couch with a really bad haircut. He is holding a mirror. Jerry and George are   looking in disbelief at the haircut. GEORGE  He massacred you. You look like you're five years old.  JERRY  What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.  GEORGE  You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.  JERRY  I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd   have to pass him every day when I go by. GEORGE  You gotta do it. JERRY  I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.   Kramer enters. He flinches when he sees the haircut. KRAMER  No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.  JERRY  He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there.  KRAMER  So what? JERRY  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.  KRAMER  His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself. I'm not going to let   you. If you don't call him I will. JERRY  No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.  KRAMER  I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.  JERRY  I don't want you to call him. KRAMER  All right, geez. You're crazy.  Kramer leaves. GEORGE  So I still haven't heard about that job.  JERRY  Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?  GEORGE  I have an idea. JERRY  Yeah? GEORGE  I show up. JERRY  What do you mean you show up? GEORGE  I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't   have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced. JERRY  Hmm. Not bad. GEORGE  What's the worst thing that could happen?  JERRY  Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out   in shame with your tail between your legs. GEORGE  Yeah, so?  At the office. GEORGE  (to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see   you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.  SECRETARY  How can I help you? GEORGE  The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell   me where my office is. SECRETARY  I wasn't aware that, uh, Mike, this is George Constanza. He's starting here today.  MIKE  Welcome aboard. GEORGE  Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard. MIKE  I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.

There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here.   You know I should ask Jack. GEORGE  Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.  MIKE  Really? GEORGE  Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love   to be nestled. MIKE  All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.  GEORGE  Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that   Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.  George walks into his office. He sets down his briefcase and coat and sits down. He quickly flips through   the folder, then drops the folder on his desk with a big thud.   George puts the folder in his briefcase. He picks up the briefcase and his coat and he walks out.   At Monk's. Jerry is wearing a baseball cap. JERRY  So what did you do there all day? GEORGE  They gave me the Pensky file. JERRY  So it's a nice place to work? GEORGE  You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.   *flashback* (a white fuzzy border is around the TV screen) GEORGE  (continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet   woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.   *end flashback* JERRY  What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?  GEORGE  He'll be back on Monday.  Elaine enters and sits down. JERRY  Hi. ELAINE  Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?  JERRY  I got a haircut. ELAINE  Oh yeah? Can I see it? JERRY  Oh there's nothing to see. ELAINE  Come on. Let me see it. JERRY  Forget it. ELAINE  Come on. JERRY  All right.  Jerry takes off his baseball cap. Elaine bursts out laughing. George starts laughing. Jerry rolls his eyes in   the air. Elaine and George are still laughing. George pounds his fist on the table.  ELAINE  (still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  JERRY  Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.  ELAINE  What? No Jerry, you have to go. GEORGE  You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.  ELAINE  (dryly) Yeah, too bad.  At the barber shop. Gino is giving Kramer a shave. KRAMER  It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.  GINO  Sure, I fix it. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. He's a little crazy. I don't know what   he'd do if he found out I touch Jerry's hair. (Enzo enters) So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the   best movie I've ever seen. ENZO  Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhands. How can you have hand like scissors, huh? Show me   one person who's got hand like scissors. GINO  Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.  ENZO  Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? (yelling) What are you going to do   on the toilet? KRAMER  I'd like to have shoehorn hands.  At Monk's. KRAMER  Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.  ELAINE  Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.  JERRY  Yeah, but how am I... KRAMER  No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.  ELAINE  Can he fix it? KRAMER  I don't know.  At Gino's apartment. GINO  Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair.  JERRY  Thank you. GINO  I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time.  JERRY  Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.  GINO  I don't think uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.  JERRY  That's nice of you to say.  The buzzer buzzes. GINO  Just a second. Yes. ENZO  (over the speaker) It's your uncle Enzo.  GINO  It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.   \"The Barber of Seville\" music is playing.  Gino picks up the chair and puts it into the closet. He picks up a broom and sweeps some hair into the next   room.  *knock, knock, knock*  Gino opens the door. GINO  Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?  ENZO  I've come to apologize. GINO  Apologize? ENZO  Yes. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.  GINO  He make me cry too. You want something to drink?  ENZO  Hey, what's all of this? GINO  Nothing. It's just hair. ENZO  You do haircut in the apartment? GINO  No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.  ENZO  It looks very familiar.  (commercial)  At Jerry's apartment. JERRY  In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.  KRAMER  Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it.  JERRY  Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.  KRAMER  Yeah, so? JERRY  I think he knew. KRAMER  No. He doesn't know. JERRY  Who do you know? He knows my hair.  KRAMER  Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself   together. JERRY  Okay, okay.  Elaine enters. ELAINE  What happened? It looks the same. JERRY  He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.  ELAINE  Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.  JERRY  Take the K-man. ELAINE  You can still go. KRAMER  What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.  ELAINE  You think? KRAMER  Do I think? He's repugnant.  Elaine fiddles with the hair, trying to make it not look so bad. It doesn't work.  ELAINE  What would you wear? KRAMER  Whatever it takes.  At the barber shop. ENZO  See, now Newman is a good customer.  NEWMAN  Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent   for it. ENZO  Oh, not everyone like Newman, so loyal.  NEWMAN  Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.  ENZO  You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like the funny business.  GINO  I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.  ENZO  Take your time. (Gino leaves) You happy with the haircut?  NEWMAN  It's okay. A little crooked. ENZO  How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.  NEWMAN  What's the catch? ENZO  You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.  NEWMAN  Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a *year's* free haircuts. And a comb.   At George's office.  George is \"playing the drums\" on his desk. He is tapping his desk with pencils.   *buzz* SECRETARY  (over the speaker) Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you.  GEORGE  Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?  Pensky enters. PENSKY  Costanza? Arthur Pensky. GEORGE  Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this   flexible accordion-style folder. PENSKY  Where's Tuttle? GEORGE  He's on vacation. PENSKY  He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me my file. (looks through the file) Looks   like you put a lot of work into this. GEORGE  Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.  PENSKY  Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming to work directly for me?  GEORGE  Really? PENSKY  You are aware...  *buzz* SECRETARY  (over the speaker) Mr. Castanza? GEORGE  Not now Florice. SECRETARY  (speaker) I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing his car.  PENSKY  Damn this city.  Pensky leaves. GEORGE  I am aware. I am aware.  At Jerry's apartment. GINO  He knows. He knows about us. JERRY  How do you know? GINO  Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the hair. He *staring* at the hair.   *knock knock knock* JERRY  Who is it? NEWMAN  It's Newman. GINO  He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.  JERRY  All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.   Jerry opens the door. JERRY  What do you want? NEWMAN  Can I use your bathroom? JERRY  What's wrong with yours? NEWMAN  My toilet's clogged. JERRY  You can't unclog it? NEWMAN  No. JERRY  Did you ask Kramer? NEWMAN  He's out. JERRY  Number one? NEWMAN  Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.  JERRY  All right. Flush twice.  He goes in the bathroom. NEWMAN  (thinking to himself) (checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) Jackpot. I don't believe this.   There's no hair in this thing. I've never seen a person that didn't have at least *one* hair in a brush.   (searches the bathtub drain) Unbelievable, nothing. (sees some scissors) Ahh.  JERRY  You all right? NEWMAN  Yeah, yeah. JERRY  All right, I'll see you later. NEWMAN  What are you doing? JERRY  I'm watching Edward Scissorhands. NEWMAN  Oh, can I watch a little? It's my favorite movie.  JERRY  Yeah all right.  Newman follows behind Jerry closely as Jerry goes to the kitchen. Newman puts the scissors close up to   Jerry's hair. Jerry turns around. Newman hides the scissors.  JERRY  You want something to drink? NEWMAN  No.  Newman tries again as Jerry goes to his couch. Newman follows behind Jerry closely. Newman puts the   scissors close up to Jerry's hair. Jerry turns around. Newman hides the scissors. Jerry looks at Newman   confused. JERRY  If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of   a barber.  Newman reaches behind Jerry and get a snip of hair. NEWMAN  Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and picks up the hair.)   Newman leaves laughing. Jerry looks confused.  At the barber shop. ENZO  Did you get it? Oh you done good Newman.  NEWMAN  It was a cinch. Where are you going?  ENZO  Io volgio vandetta.  At the auction house. ELAINE  Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.  WOMAN  A thousand. ELAINE  A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky   lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.  Kramer peeks out the curtain and comes out and walks around on stage.  ELAINE  Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.  KRAMER  Equivalent. ELAINE  Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. He's uh, self-employed. He's...   I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.   Kramer steps from the stage onto a table. The table tips over and Kramer falls off.  ELAINE  Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, uh, five bucks?   At Jerry's apartment. JERRY  I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or   somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.   *knock, knock, knock* JERRY  Who is it? ENZO  (yelling) Enzo Manginero.  \"Barber of Seville\" music playing. JERRY  Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.  ENZO  It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.  JERRY  No I wasn't there. ENZO  Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. I match them up.  JERRY  Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.  GINO  Don't Jerry. ENZO  So, it's true. GINO  Yes it's true. ENZO  I'm going to kill the both of you.   Enzo notices \"Edward Scissorhands\" playing on the TV and becomes calm.   At the office.  George is at his desk sleeping with a newspaper draped over him. Tuttle walks in. He bangs on the door.   George wakes up. GEORGE  Mr. Tuttle, you're back. TUTTLE  George, I'm surprised to see you here.  GEORGE  You are? TUTTLE  I though you would have taken the large office.  GEORGE  Oh. Really. TUTTLE  I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what   you've been up to all week. (pages through the file) What have you been doing all week?  GEORGE  Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.  TUTTLE  You haven't done anything with this.  GEORGE  Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.  TUTTLE  I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.  GEORGE  You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.  TUTTLE  (scoffs) You're not Pensky material.  GEORGE  Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.   At Jerry's apartment.  Gino and Enzo are watching \"Edward Scissorhands\" on TV. They are both sobbing.   At the barber shop.  \"Barber of Seville\" music is playing.  Jerry looks in the barber shop window and sees Newman giving a guy a haircut. He enters. Newman looks   at him scared. Jerry picks up an electric razor and walks toward Newman. Newman is very frightened.   (commercial) PENSKY  Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you   are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing   business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you.  GEORGE  Obviously.  *buzz* PENSKY  Yes. SECRETARY  (over the speaker) Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car is being towed.   George waves his hand and the final note of \"Barber of Seville\" plays.  THE END>",

ELAINE  It isn't? JERRY  No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.  ELAINE  Get out! JERRY  Not since June 29, 1980. ELAINE  You remember the date? JERRY  Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George: \"Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again.\"  ELAINE  Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.  JERRY  Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.  ELAINE  Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)  JOANNE  Hi, we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop.  ELAINE  Oh, yeah? JOANNE  Yeah. What's his name? ELAINE  Joel... JOANNE  Joel what? ELAINE  Uh... Rifkin. MICHAEL  Rifkin? Joel Rifkin? ELAINE  Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.  MICHAEL  Guess you better keep on his good side.  ELAINE  Very funny. That's very funny. JOANNE  I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.  ELAINE  All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.  MICHAEL  Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...  ELAINE  (she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!   (scene ends)  (Jerry's) ELAINE  The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.  JERRY  But you like your Joel Rifkin. ELAINE  Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.  JERRY  Ask him to change it. ELAINE  You can't ask a person to change their name.  JERRY  Why not? ELAINE  Would you change yours? JERRY  If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.   (Kramer enters) ELAINE  Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?  JERRY  Yeah. Eighteen strangles. KRAMER  You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)  ELAINE  You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.   (Jerry doesn't have the time to open his mouth before Kramer pops in again)  KRAMER  I'll go. ELAINE  O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.  KRAMER  Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again) ELAINE  You think I should have asked George?  JERRY  Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?  ELAINE  Karen? JERRY  Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)  ELAINE  Oh! The Risotto broad. JERRY  Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.  ELAINE  I tought you didn't like double dates.  JERRY  George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.  ELAINE  I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.  JERRY  He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.  ELAINE  And you're taking... JERRY  Jody the masseuse. ELAINE  Hey, did you get a massage yet? JERRY  No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?  ELAINE  Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.  JERRY  Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.  ELAINE  So what? JERRY  Well it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.   (scene ends)  (The Chinese restaurant (the same as in 'The Chinese Restaurant'))   (Jerry, Jody, Karen and George sitting at a table. Yes! They got a table!)  GEORGE  (George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her: \"Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?\"  KAREN  That is so funny. GEORGE  (to Jody) You're listening to this?  JODI  Yeah. I heard you. JERRY  (to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.  JODI  (to George) So what did she say? GEORGE  Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)  JODI  You just said that you said it. GEORGE  Sweetheart, I was exaggerating. KAREN  I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.  JERRY  (touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.  GEORGE  You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.  JODI  How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?  GEORGE  Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.  JODI  (to Jerry) Can we go? JERRY  Yeah. Let's go. KAREN  So soon? (they get up) JERRY  Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.  KAREN  Yeah. JODI  Nice meeting you Karen. KAREN  Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.  JODI  Oh yeah. GEORGE  Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)  JODI  Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away)  (scene ends)  (Jerry's place later that night)  (Jerry and Jody are sitting next to each other on the couch, watching TV)  JERRY  I strained my neck last night. JODI  Really, how? JERRY  I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.  JODI  So what's the deal with your friend George?  JERRY  No deal. Why? JODI  What was all that \"attractive women not getting tickets\" nonsense?  JERRY  He was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.  JODI  I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.  JERRY  Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)  JODI  Did you see the way that he was eating?  JERRY  Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)  JODI  I have to tell you, I really don't like him.  JERRY  Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)  JODI  It's just I hate that type. JERRY  Yeah, he's a bad seed. JODI  Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)  JERRY  What are you doing? JODI  What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...)   (scene ends)  (The Chinese restaurant)  (George and Karen are still at the table, they're about to leave)  GEORGE  So, what do you think? KAREN  Really enjoyed it. GEORGE  Jody's nice. KAREN  She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.  GEORGE  You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.  KAREN  Yeah GEORGE  I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?  KAREN  You were *extremely* personable. GEORGE  I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?  KAREN  I didn't pick up anything. GEORGE  The second time I sent the noodle back, I tought she made a face...  KAREN  I didn't see a face. GEORGE  I tought I saw a face. KAREN  Anyhow, what is the difference? GEORGE  No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.  KAREN  George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying: \"instead of the movie...\")  GEORGE  He he he he KAREN  Ah ah ah ah GEORGE  So you think she likes me?  (Karen gives up and slams her forehead down on the table)  (scene ends)  (Elaine's place)  (She's sitting on the couch, reading, and Joel is coming quietly behind her to massage her neck.)  ELAINE  (as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?  JOEL  Massaging your neck. ELAINE  Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging. JOEL  Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)  ELAINE  Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Dion these days. What a cool name, Dion. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Dion.  JOEL  Dion Benes? ELAINE  Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Dion Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.  JOEL  D-Dion Rifkin? ELAINE  Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!  JOEL  Elaine! What is going on?  (scene ends)  (Monk's)  (Jerry and George at a booth) GEORGE  She stayed over? JERRY  Yeah. (disappointed) GEORGE  The sex wasn't so good? JERRY  No. The sex was fabulous. GEORGE  So? JERRY  I want the massage! GEORGE  Did you ask her? JERRY  I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.  GEORGE  Why not? JERRY  I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.  GEORGE  So we had a good time... the four of us.  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  What did Jodi say? JERRY  She had a good time. GEORGE  Is that it? JERRY  Pretty much. GEORGE  Did she say anything about, uh... JERRY  What? GEORGE  Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.  JERRY  Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)  GEORGE  You just hesitated. JERRY  I was blowing on the coffee. GEORGE  She didn't like me? JERRY  Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.  GEORGE  So she doesn't like me? JERRY  No. GEORGE  She said that? JERRY  Yes. GEORGE  She told you she doesn't like me! JERRY  Yes. GEORGE  What were her exact-- JERRY  \"I don't like him.\" GEORGE  Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?  JERRY  Not everybody likes everybody! GEORGE  I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?  JERRY  You were very nice! GEORGE  I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?  JERRY  It has nothing to do with her sister.  GEORGE  I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking!   (scene ends)  (hall in Jerry's building)  (George and Jerry are coming back from Monk's) GEORGE  You vomited in 1987. JERRY  Oh no. That was the dry heaves.  (Jodi is in front of Jerry's door) JERRY  Jodi. JODI  Hey, Jerry. GEORGE  Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like: it's so great to be all here)  JERRY  What are you doing here? JODI  I was giving Kramer a massage. JERRY  Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)  JODI  I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.  GEORGE  Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.  JODI  No that's O.K. GEORGE  Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)  JERRY  I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)  KRAMER  Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!  JERRY  Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!  KRAMER  You don't know what you're missing buddy.   (they enter Jerry's apartment)  (scene ends)  (street in front of Jerry's building)  (George and Jodi) GEORGE  No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.  JODI  You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi)  GEORGE  Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)   (scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Kramer is lying on the couch as Jerry is cutting a block of cheese on the kitchen counter)  KRAMER  (Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)  JERRY  So you had a good time. KRAMER  Oh... yeah... JERRY  Enjoyed yourself. KRAMER  Very... much... JERRY  All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)  KRAMER  What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)  JERRY  The massages are out! KRAMER  Wha-- JERRY  Ahh!!! They're out! KRAMER  Why?! JERRY  Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.  KRAMER  Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!  JERRY  I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)  KRAMER  Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)  JERRY  Don't you ever talk about her like that!  KRAMER  But why? JERRY  That's final!!! KRAMER  Ah!!! Yahh!!!  (scene ends)  (Giants Stadium)  (Elaine and Joel) ELAINE  Oh, you have photos in your wallet?  JOEL  Yeah. Why? Is that weird? ELAINE  No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?  JOEL  That's my mother. ELAINE  Oh yeah. I see the resemblance. JOEL  No, there's no resemblance. ELAINE  Yeah, there is, right here you see--  JOEL  Elaine, I was adopted. ELAINE  (pause) Oh. That's nice. JOEL  The game's about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is.   (scene ends)  (ticket counter) KRAMER  (to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.  TICKET MAN  Here it is. I need some I.D. KRAMER  Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.  TICKET MAN  Well, I can't give it to you then.  KRAMER  Are you kidding me? TICKET MAN  I'm afraid not. KRAMER  Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.  TICKET MAN  I'm sorry. I need proof. KRAMER  Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.  TICKET MAN  Neither do I. But without I.D., I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket.  KRAMER  Where is a phone?  (scene ends)  (back to Elaine and Joel watching the game) ANNOUNCER  Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Would Joel Rifkin report to the stadium office. Joel Rifkin...telephone. (the crowd stops cheering and we see a football player distracted from the game while hearing the announcer saying Joel Rifkin)  JOEL  Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around)  ELAINE  (to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.   (scene ends)  (Jerry's apartment)  (Kramer enters, moaning) KRAMER  Oh, God. JERRY  What's the matter with you? KRAMER  Jerry, I need another massage! JERRY  You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?  KRAMER  Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.  JERRY  Oh please. KRAMER  And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! It's killing me Jerry!  JERRY  Well, did you get the ball? KRAMER  Oh I got the ball. JERRY  Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.  KRAMER  Well, It's quite a thrill. JERRY  Why don't you get somebody else? KRAMER  Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.  JERRY  Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No \"if and's or but's\".  KRAMER  What about my massage? JERRY  Ask Newman.  (scene ends)  (Monk's)  (George and Karen at a booth) GEORGE  So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?  KAREN  Of course. GEORGE  No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.  KAREN  What, do you think I've never had a massage before?  GEORGE  Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!  KAREN  George, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about her.  GEORGE  I wanna know what I did to this woman.  KAREN  What, you got a little thing for her?  GEORGE  No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.  KAREN  What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesn't like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you?  GEORGE  Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!   (scene ends)  (Elaine's apartment)  (Elaine and Joel sitting on the couch) ELAINE  Of course I support your decision to change your name.  JOEL  After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isn't going away.  ELAINE  Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.  JOEL  Sure? ELAINE  (she fakes a strangling) RRR... JOEL  O.K. you got your list? ELAINE  Yeah. Yeah. 10 names. JOEL  Right. ELAINE  O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.  JOEL  O.K. ELAINE  O.K. You start. What's your first choice?  JOEL  Stuart. ELAINE  (right away) No. Second choice. JOEL  Stu--Stuart's no good? ELAINE  I've never met a normal guy named Stuart.  JOEL  O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd.  ELAINE  (repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.  JOEL  All right. Oh, Hey, I think you're gonna like my first my third choice.  ELAINE  Great... JOEL  Alex. ELAINE  I gotta tell you, I have a bad association with the name Alex.  JOEL  Bad bad association? ELAINE  Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go: \"Ahh!\". I mean every two seconds: \"Ahh!\". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone: \"Ahh!\". I had to drop the class.   (scnen ends)  (Jerry's place)  (Jerry is opening the door for Jodi. She has her massage table. New age music is playing, and the lights are shaded)  JODI  Hey. JERRY  Hi. JODI  Hi. (kissing) I was running late and I didn't have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over.  JERRY  Ah, no problem. That's fine. JODI  What's with this music? JERRY  That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)  JODI  What are you doing? JERRY  Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.  JODI  Actually, I should get a new one. JERRY  Nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)  JODI  So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)  JERRY  Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.  JODI  (she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.  JERRY  Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)  JODI  I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away)  JERRY  No. Yes you can. (he hangs on) JODI  No, I can't! JERRY  Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)   (scene ends)  (Karen's place)  (George and Karen are making out on the couch) GEORGE  You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.  KAREN  You're going now? GEORGE  I think I can still catch her. KAREN  All right George. I have had just about enough of this.  GEORGE  What? What are you talking about. KAREN  I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!  GEORGE  I know. I know. KAREN  Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?  GEORGE  (he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)  KAREN  Well, now *I* hate you! GEORGE  That I'm used to. (he leaves)  (scene ends)  (back to Elaine's place) JOEL  Ned? ELAINE  What is wrong with Ned? JOEL  Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!  ELAINE  Ellis. JOEL  Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!  ELAINE  Ellis and Alex aren't even close. JOEL  NEXT! ELAINE  Ohh, what is the point? JOEL  NO, NO. COME ON! ELAINE  O.K. O.K. Remy. JOEL  Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?  ELAINE  Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.  JOEL  Grrrr!  (scene ends)  (back to Jerry's) JERRY  What do you mean, no? JODI  No means no. JERRY  Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.  JODI  Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.  JERRY  Fine. Go.  (George enters. He's staring at Jodi) GEORGE  Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?  JERRY  What for? GEORGE  We need to talk. JERRY  *You* need to talk? JODI  We have nothing to talk about. GEORGE  Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.  JERRY  George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.  GEORGE  (he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.  JERRY  What? GEORGE  She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.  JERRY  I can see that. JODI  I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.  JERRY  Don't worry. (she leaves) GEORGE  A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.  JERRY  You're a lucky guy. GEORGE  I got to go after her. JERRY  George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)  GEORGE  JODI! (he starts running after her) THE END>",

        "text": "         THE CIGAR STORE INDIAN Written by       Tom Gammill &amp; Max Pross   (Comedy club)  Jerry's standup piece. JERRY  You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because   they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'  (George's parents' house)  Elaine and Jerry in the living room. JERRY  How would you describe the smell in this house?  ELAINE  (sniffing) Dandruff? JERRY  Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?  ELAINE  There's some kasha. JERRY  Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.  George enters from the kitchen (?). ELAINE  Alright, let's go, come on. GEORGE  Wha... you're going? ELAINE  Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.  Kramer enters from bathroom. He's holding some brightly coloured objects in his hand and obviously has an unpleasant taste in his mouth. KRAMER  Egh. These aren't candies. GEORGE  Kramer. did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage) KRAMER  Well I'm a guest. GEORGE  Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.  JERRY  You're not allowed to have people over?  GEORGE  I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return   the soaps) KRAMER  What, this is a party? ELAINE  Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.   Jerry, Elaine and Kramer begin to leave. George re-enters and notices Jerry's mug on the coffee table. GEORGE  (yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!  JERRY  (picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.  GEORGE  But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen) KRAMER  Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?   George returns with a cloth and begins wiping at the stain.  ELAINE  (impatient) Come on! JERRY  What's the big rush? ELAINE  I'm having people over. JERRY  Who? ELAINE  The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...  JERRY  Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?  ELAINE  Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.  JERRY  (interested) Really? ELAINE  I'll put in a good word for you. JERRY  Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back   on the table) GEORGE  (screaming) Aaahh!! JERRY  Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)  GEORGE  But Jerry, this is not coming out!  JERRY  Just put a coffee table book over it.  GEORGE  My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the   table! KRAMER  Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it? ELAINE  Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.  GEORGE  Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing   refinished. ELAINE  Now?! GEORGE  Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I   gotta have it back before them! ELAINE  Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.  KRAMER  Alright, we'll take the subway. JERRY  There you go. That'll get you home in time.  ELAINE  Oh! The subway? From Queens? GEORGE  Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.  JERRY  I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.  ELAINE  I need something to read on the subway.  JERRY  (handing her a magazine) Here, read this.  ELAINE  (looks at it) TV Guide?  (Subway train)  Elaine and Kramer sit together. Elaine is reading TV Guide, Kramer is expanding on his book concept. KRAMER  I got history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told. ELAINE  (engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm. KRAMER  So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?  ELAINE  (still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.  KRAMER  (claps hands) Yes indeed. TANNOY  Next stop, Queensboro Plaza. KRAMER  Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one? ELAINE  How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?  KRAMER  Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and   wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one? ELAINE  (laughing) No thanks. KRAMER  Alright, but no bites.  Kramer goes to the door, where he stands jostling with a couple of other guys waiting for it to open. When it does, they all exit in a hurry. Elaine continues to study the TV Guide. A guy sitting opposite (bald, glasses, anorak inside and out) proffers a pen. RICKY  Highlighter? ELAINE  Excuse me? RICKY  To highlight the programmes you plan to watch.  ELAINE  Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read. RICKY  Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television.   The train about to leave, the doors begin to close. As they do, Kramer tries to enter. The door closes, trapping his arm at the shoulder, leaving him holding his gyro into the carriage. KRAMER  (yells) Elaine!  A passenger walking down the carriage grabs the gyro from Kramer's hand and sits down to eat it. Kramer extracts his arm and the doors slam closed.  RICKY  Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.  ELAINE  He's not my boyfriend. RICKY  He's not? (thoughtful) Interesting.   (Furniture refinishers)  Gepetto, the store owner is assessing the state of the coffee table.  JERRY  Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.  GEORGE  Why? JERRY  Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me? GEORGE  Can't hurt you. JERRY  What about, what about this thing?  GEORGE  The Indian? JERRY  Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.  GEPETTO  Well, I can have the table ready for you on Monday.  GEORGE  Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.  GEPETTO  They left you home alone, huh?  (Subway train)  Elaine still sits with Ricky the TV anorak. He's poring over the TV Guide. Elaine is looking like she'd rather be anywhere else. RICKY  Oh, 'kay, see. On this particular Tuesday (he swaps seats and sits beside Elaine) you could've watched six hours of Lucy. There's I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy.  The brakes come on as the train pulls into a stop. ELAINE  Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.  RICKY  (after Elaine) Hey miss! (waving TV Guide) You forgot this!   Elaine has gone. Ricky looks at the cover of the magazine, and sees the address label, upon which is printed F. COSTANZA, 1344 QUEENS BLVD, FLUSHING NY 11353   (Furniture refinishers)  Gepetto explaining the Indian to Jerry. George sits waiting.  GEPETTO  They don't make these any more. The work is, is all done by hand. (Sylvia enters the store behind him) Takes years, and years, and... (notices) Sylvia! For crying out, you're forty-five minutes late! SYLVIA  Yeah, yeah. (to George, smiling) Is that your car out there?  GEORGE  No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)  SYLVIA  Oh, nice. You guys are obviously from Manhattan.  GEORGE  Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.  SYLVIA  Really? Ah, I didn't think any cool guys lived in this neighbourhood.  GEORGE  (sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighbourhood's changing.  JERRY  Alright, I'll take it. GEPETTO  Smart choice. SYLVIA  Wow, you bought the Indian? Oh, you guys have great taste.  GEORGE  Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we   must have them.  (Elaine's apartment)  Elaine and the girls are sitting at a table playing poker. ELAINE  Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces  THE GIRLS  Oh/Aah. (and similar comments) ELAINE  (triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!  There's a knock at the door. ELAINE  Who is it? JERRY  It's Jerry.  Elaine gets up and opens the door, revealing Jerry standing beside a large object (the Indian) half-covered with a black plastic bag. ELAINE  Jerry! JERRY  Surprise! (he carries in the object)  ELAINE  What is this? JERRY  Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.  ELAINE  Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?  THE GIRLS  Hi Jerry/Hello. (etc) JERRY  Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.  GIRL  Elaine, is it your birthday? ELAINE  No. JERRY  I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy. THE GIRLS  Aww/That's so sweet. (general murmur of approval)  JERRY  Are you ready? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  (whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da!   There is a deathly hush. JERRY  It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.  ELAINE  (examines card) (embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.  JERRY  Read it out loud. ELAINE  I, I don't think so. JERRY  (takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.  WINONA  (gathering her stuff) Hey, you know, it's late. I really should go.  ELAINE  I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...   Jerry begins rocking the Indian back and forth, making the stereotypical movie Indian chant. JERRY  Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.  Winona leaves, looking offended. ELAINE  Are you out of your mind?! JERRY  ...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.  ELAINE  Winona is a Native American. JERRY  She is?  (George's parents' house)  Sylvia is looking round the living room. Some cheesy male harmony singing can be heard in the background. SYLVIA  You got very unusual taste. GEORGE  (proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled. SYLVIA  Fine. GEORGE  I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block. SYLVIA  (regarding photo) Ahh! Is this your son in the bubble bath?  GEORGE  (bashful) No, that's me. SYLVIA  Oh. You don't see many guys your age who keep baby pictures of themselves around. (laughs) I like it. Consistent with the rest of the house.  GEORGE  Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house. SYLVIA  What is this we're listening to? GEORGE  The Ray Conniff Singers. (nervous chuckle)  SYLVIA  Mmmm, what's that smell? Kasha? GEORGE  It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they   leave together)  Jerry, downstairs at Winona's building. He's talking on the buzzer.  WINONA  Who is it? JERRY  Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld. WINONA  (unimpressed) Yeah? JERRY  Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really   like to apologise. Can I come up? WINONA  I'll come down.  (Elaine's apartment) KRAMER  I came by to get my ball. ELAINE  It's right over there. KRAMER  Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you   think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from? ELAINE  You want it? KRAMER  (unbelieving) I can have this?! ELAINE  Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.  KRAMER  Oh. I'll lug.  (Street outside Winona's) WINONA  It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.  JERRY  And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya? WINONA  (smiling) I guess I could go for a bite.  JERRY  You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in   this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.  The mailman stands, turns and is revealed as Chinese. He takes offence.  MAILMAN  Why must I know? Because I'm Chinese? You think I know where all the Chinese restaurants are? (adopts hackneyed Chinese accent) Oh, ask honolable Chinaman for rocation of lestaulant. JERRY  I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.  MAILMAN  Oh, hello American Joe. Which way to hamburger, hotdog stand? (storms away) JERRY  I didn't know that... WINONA  You know, it's late. I should probably just go home.  JERRY  I, I had no idea.  A cab drives by. Kramer leans out the window, along with the top of the Indian.  KRAMER  (yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)  Winona looks offended again. Jerry is mortified, and can find nothing to say. Winona storms back into her building.  (George's parent's house)  George and Jerry are returning the table. GEORGE  Looks pretty good. JERRY  Yeah, did a good job.  They put the various ornaments back on the table. GEORGE  Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.  JERRY  You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the   Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way's Israel, I don't fly off the handle.  GEORGE  So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...  JERRY  Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see   her tonight. GEORGE  Oh, great. JERRY  Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake. GEORGE  Aw c'mon.  The front door opens and George's parents enter. ESTELLE  Hello, hello! GEORGE  (insincerely) Ahh, hey you're home. Hi.  ESTELLE  Oh, the house looks very nice. GEORGE  Yeah, huh. FRANK  Where's the mail? ESTELLE  Hello Jerry. JERRY  Hello. GEORGE  So, how was the trip? ESTELLE  Ah, your father... FRANK  Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?  ESTELLE  I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom)  FRANK  (examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?  GEORGE  What TV Guide? FRANK  I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.  JERRY  Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.  FRANK  Elaine took it? GEORGE  I didn't know she took it! JERRY  Wa, it's two weeks old. FRANK  (shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!  GEORGE  (to Jerry) He collects them. JERRY  You collect TV Guide? FRANK  The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!  ESTELLE  (screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed. FRANK  (taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?! ESTELLE  What is this doing on my bed?! GEORGE  I don't know, uh... JERRY  I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)  FRANK  You were having sex on our bed?! GEORGE  Yes! ESTELLE  Who told you you could have sex in our bed?  GEORGE  (pleading) Well, my bed is too small.  FRANK  Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into,   into Bourbon Street! ESTELLE  Where am I going to sleep? GEORGE  What're you talking about? ESTELLE  I can't sleep in there! GEORGE  Of course you can. ESTELLE  I can't! (screams) I can't! FRANK  That's it! You're grounded! GEORGE  (incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.  FRANK  You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're   grounded!  (Winona's apartment)  Jerry sits on the couch. Winona enters with their jackets. WINONA  So, where are we gonna go eat? JERRY  I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.  WINONA  Ooh, I love that place, but it's usually so crowded. Can we get a table?  JERRY  Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)  WINONA  You made what? JERRY  I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodation. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats. WINONA  How did you get these? JERRY  Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again) A uh, one   of those guys. WINONA  What guys? JERRY  You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events. WINONA  Oh. JERRY  Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.  WINONA  That's Al Roker. JERRY  Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this? WINONA  Sure, take it. JERRY  Thanks.  (Jerry's apartment)  Jerry enters with the TV Guide. JERRY  So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.  ELAINE  Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?  JERRY  Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.  ELAINE  He collects (holds up magazine) these?  JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al   Roker TV Guide to him. JERRY  What'ya do with the one you took? ELAINE  I dunno.  (Ricky's apartment (?))  Ricky sits at a table, in a room which looks like that of a messy teenager. He's cutting away at the TV Guide with a pair of scissors. He's humming the theme to I Love Lucy to himself as he does so.  (Jerry's apartment)  Kramer enters. ELAINE  Hi. KRAMER  Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?  ELAINE  What did who say? KRAMER  Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?  ELAINE  Uhmm... KRAMER  Yeah, you didn't tell him didya? ELAINE  Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it... KRAMER  (simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...  ELAINE  I would be embarrassed to bring it up.  JERRY  I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a   coffee table. KRAMER  Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go. JERRY  Where you going? KRAMER  Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian. JERRY  My Indian? KRAMER  You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)   He leaves.  (George's parents' house)  George and Frank in front of the TV. Frank is still bothered by the TV Guide incident. George is slumped in the sofa, looking long-suffering.  FRANK  How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?  Estelle answers the door. Opening it, she finds Ricky outside, holding what looks like a bouquet of flowers. RICKY  Hello. Is Elaine home? ESTELLE  Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.  FRANK  (shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!  RICKY  (entering) Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide. FRANK  (yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!  RICKY  (seeing TV) Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?  GEORGE  Yeah. RICKY  Oh, this is a good one.  (Subway train)  Elaine riding the subway to Queens. TANNOY  Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.  A thought occurs to Elaine. ELAINE  Mmm, gyro.  She jumps up and goes to the door. She sizes up the woman next to her at the exit. When the doors open, she barges the woman aside and rushes out first.   (Jerry's apartment)  Jerry is pouring glasses of Perrier in the kitchen while Winona looks around.  WINONA  I like your place. It's very unassuming.  JERRY  Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.  WINONA  (laughs) Oh, by the way. That TV Guide I gave you, I need it back.  JERRY  Why? WINONA  Well, I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use   that interview with Al Roker. JERRY  Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father. WINONA  Jerry, I really need it back. It, it is mine.  JERRY  You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself) WINONA  What? JERRY  A uh, a person that uh... WINONA  A person that what? JERRY  Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and   they wish they had, had never uh... WINONA  And? JERRY  ...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.  WINONA  You mean like, an Indian giver?! JERRY  I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.   (Subway train)  Elaine is eating her gyro. As she does, unseen by her, juices from her sandwich are dripping onto the TV Guide in her bag.  (George's parents' house)  Frank and Ricky are going through Frank's TV Guide collection. The coffee table is covered in boxes of the magazine. RICKY  I like the special fall preview issues the best.  FRANK  Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.   The doorbell rings. RICKY  These are worth like, a lot of money.   Estelle opens the door, to find Elaine. ESTELLE  Oh, hello Elaine! ELAINE  Hello. (she enters) RICKY  (jumping to his feet) Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.   Elaine looks nervous and surprised. FRANK  Why'd you take my TV Guide? ELAINE  (placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over) RICKY  I made this for you. ELAINE  (accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.  FRANK  (examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do? RICKY  Hey, you can't talk to her like that.  FRANK  (yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!  RICKY  Come on Elaine, let's go.  As Ricky strides over to Elaine, he catches the coffee table with his leg. It tips up with the weight of the TV Guide collection and falls over with a crash.  ESTELLE  My coffee table!  (Gus' Smoke Shop)  Kramer is stands beside the Indian in the cigar store, trying to do a job of salesmanship. The guy behind the counter doesn't look impressed. In the background, Mr Lippman is browsing. KRAMER  I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian?   It's unseemly. SPIKE  I'll give you a box of Coronas for it.  KRAMER  Forget it. LIPPMAN  Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?  KRAMER  Oh yeah, yeah. LIPPMAN  Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it? KRAMER  Giddyup. LIPPMAN  Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door.   Pendant Publishing. KRAMER  Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.   (Lippman's office)  Kramer is sitting in a chair before the desk, smoking a cigar. Elaine enters.  ELAINE  Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!  KRAMER  Yeah, hi Elaine. ELAINE  What are you doing in here with that?  KRAMER  Ah, well, it's a business transaction.  LIPPMAN  (entering, smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh, petty   cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead, count it.  KRAMER  Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall. LIPPMAN  You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.  KRAMER  You mind if I use it in my book? LIPPMAN  What book? KRAMER  Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.  LIPPMAN  About coffee tables?  Elaine is pulling skeptical faces. KRAMER  Uh huh. LIPPMAN  That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?  KRAMER  Well, I'm still shopping it around.  LIPPMAN  Yeah? (to Elaine) You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?  ELAINE  Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...  LIPPMAN  (ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?  Elaine looks sick.  (Furniture refinishers)  Estelle is showing the table to Sylvia. SYLVIA  I know this coffee table, it's George Costanza's.  ESTELLE  It's mine. I'm his mother. SYLVIA  Oh, I haven't seen George for a while. He must be working very hard.  ESTELLE  George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.  SYLVIA  He does?  (Subway train)  Jerry and Elaine sit together on the train. Elaine still looks unhappy. Jerry has a copy of the TV Guide. JERRY  I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV   Guide. ELAINE  I dunno. JERRY  Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine) ELAINE  I guess. JERRY  What's the matter? ELAINE  What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's   coffee table book. JERRY  It is a good idea, Elaine. TANNOY  Next stop, Queensboro Plaza. JERRY  You want a gyro? ELAINE  I don't think so.  Jerry jumps up and rushes out of the door, pushing his way past other commuters.  moments later)  Elaine sits alone in her seat. Jerry tries to enter the carriage just as the doors close. They close on his arm, trapping it. JERRY  Elaine!  A guy walking through the carriage picks the gyro out of Jerry's hand, just as Jerry pulls his arm free. He sits down opposite Elaine, preparing to eat.  AL ROKER  Guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train.  ELAINE  He's not my boyfriend. AL ROKER  He's not? Interesting. (gives a big grin)   Elaine gets a flicker of recognition. She lifts up the TV Guide and finds the guy opposite her is the same guy pictured on the cover, Al Roker. She looks up at the real guy again and he has the exact expression as the picture on the cover.  (Nightclub)  More Jerry standup. JERRY  I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow   when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?      THE END>",

        "text": "   THE CONVERSION Written by Bruce Kirschbaum   (Comedy club) JERRY  You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But   it's really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma   right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesn't it? \"I   really am a doctor you know. You think I'm not, just check it out.\" I don't   know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the   time. \"Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and I'll   give you my opinion.\" After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems   like they know what they're talking about. In any difference of opinion,   pants always beats no-pants.  (Commercial)  At a restaurant. GEORGE  Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is   unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive. GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND  Twenty five dollars. GEORGE  Yes, well, you know, I'm not thinking about the price. You know   you're the only woman I've never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I   beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster. GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND  George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we   have a problem. GEORGE  We do? GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND  We can't keep seeing each other. GEORGE  Why? GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND  (crying) Because it's over. *sob, sob, sob* It's my   parents, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me?   *sob* WAITER  Uh, have you decided yet? GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND  (crying) Yes. I'll have the lobster.  GEORGE  Um, you know I'm starting to think that maybe lobster isn't the way   to go.  The hallway outside Jerry's apartment. JERRY  Then he asked you out? ELAINE  We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his   hand on my heart. JERRY  On your heart? ELAINE  Jerry, the man is a doctor. JERRY  Doctor? He's a podiatrist. ELAINE  It's the same thing. JERRY  Anyone can get into podiatry school. *George* got into podiatry   school. ELAINE  Really? JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  Hello. JERRY  Oh hi. JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  Are you going to be stopping by later?  JERRY  Yes, I'll be stopping. See you later. (to Elaine) Well we can't all   be dating podiatrists.  They enter Jerry's apartment. GEORGE  It's over. ELAINE  What? JERRY  How did you get in? GEORGE  Kramer. ELAINE  What's that? GEORGE  Lobster. JERRY  Looks like a swan. GEORGE  She says we can't go out anymore. ELAINE  Why? GEORGE  Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents won't let her get   involved with anyone who isn't Latvian Orthodox. ELAINE  Latvian Orthodox? Mmm, it is lobster.  JERRY  She's limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.  GEORGE  I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that's not   entirely true. ELAINE  Mmm, delicious. JERRY  Mmm, succulent. GEORGE  She knew I didn't have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didn't seem   to bother her. I think I could have married this woman. ELAINE  Why don't you just ask her parents?  GEORGE  I can't. I met them. They're devout. You know, In the cab on the   way over here, I actually thought about converting. JERRY  To Latvian Orthodox? GEORGE  Why not? What do I care? JERRY  You know it's not like changing toothpaste.  ELAINE  I think it would be romantic. GEORGE  Really? ELAINE  Yeah, it's like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying   Mrs. Simpson. Ooh. GEORGE  King Edward. King Edward, Jerry. JERRY  Yeah well King Edward didn't live in Queens with Frank and Estelle   Costanza. GEORGE  You know what? I could probably do this. What's the difference.  ELAINE  George I was just kidding around. GEORGE  No. I wouldn't even have to tell her. I could surprise her.  ELAINE  George I wasn't serious. GEORGE  How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, have a   ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am *really* going to think about   this.  George leaves. ELAINE  I guess this one is my fault. JERRY  Oh yeah.  At Jerry's girlfriend's apartment. JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  *kiss, kiss, kiss* Oh that was nice. Have you always   been such a good kisser? JERRY  Oh I don't know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I   was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room   practicing my kissing. JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  Well it was worth it. *kiss* I'll be *kiss* right *kiss*   back *kiss*. Where are you going? JERRY  To wash my hands. They're sticky from the orange.  JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  Meet you back here? JERRY  Right there.  Jerry goes into the bathroom and washes his hands.  He sees the medicine cabinet open slightly and peeks in. JERRY  (thinking to himself) \"Fungicide\". Fungus?   At Monk's. JERRY  Fungicide. I mean what could she have?  ELAINE  I don't know. KRAMER  Fungus. ELAINE  So what did you say? JERRY  I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go   home. ELAINE  What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?  JERRY  I didn't open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.  ELAINE  You were snooping. JERRY  I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking   and entering. I wouldn't do that. KRAMER  I would. I always open medicine cabinets.  ELAINE  Well I trust people not to do that.  KRAMER  Big mistake. JERRY  Why don't you ask that doctor what it is?  ELAINE  What? Now he's a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.  JERRY  But that's what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. They're knee-   deep in fungus. This guy know fungus. ELAINE  I am not going to ask him about funguses.  KRAMER  Fungi. JERRY  What? KRAMER  Fungi.  In the priest's office.  (boy, I am *really* bad with names on this episode... ;) ) FATHER-PRIEST  Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?  GEORGE  *ahem* In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask   himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something   so um... (trying to think of a word) FATHER-PRIEST  Enigmatic? GEORGE  No. FATHER-PRIEST  Vast? (he pronounces it as \"vost\")  GEORGE  No not vast (he pronounces it as \"vost\")  FATHER-PRIEST  Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion.  GEORGE  Yes. FATHER-PRIEST 2  Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly   attractive? GEORGE  (he thinks) I think the hats. The hat convey that solemn religious   look you want in a faith. Very pious. FATHER-PRIEST  Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?  GEORGE  Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic   plot. Yeah. FATHER-PRIEST  Plot? GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the   commandments and all that. FATHER-PRIEST 2  Well it's obvious that you are sincere in your desire.  GEORGE  Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?  FATHER-PRIEST  The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these   texts (brings out a pile of books). GEORGE  Ah hah. You see Father, I'm I'm incredibly anxious to become a   member. Um, don't you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick   change?  Sister Roberta enters. SISTER ROBERTA  Oh I'm sorry. Father, there's a man waiting in the chapel.  FATHER-PRIEST  You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He   is interested in joining the church. SISTER ROBERTA  Oh are you? That's wonderful. Well good luck to you.  GEORGE  Nice nun. FATHER-PRIEST  No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a   novice. FATHER-PRIEST 2  She won't be taking her final vows until next Thursday.   In the chapel. SISTER ROBERTA  May I help you? KRAMER  Oh yeah, I'm here to pick up my friend George Costanza.  SISTER ROBERTA  Well he's in with the Father. KRAMER  Oh yeah. SISTER ROBERTA  I'm Sister Roberta. KRAMER  Oh. Kramer. Pleasure. SISTER ROBERTA  Mine. (she smiles at Kramer)  At Jerry's apartment. GEORGE  I can't believe how easy it is. I'm virtually Orthodox. All I have   to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and I'm in the club.  JERRY  That's all there is to it. GEORGE  That's all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother   Costanza. JERRY  And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?  GEORGE  Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.   Kramer enters. He is flinging a slinky. JERRY  Oh a slinky. Where did you get it?  KRAMER  Sister Roberta gave it to me. JERRY  Why did she give you that? KRAMER  I think she liked me. JERRY  What do you mean she liked you? KRAMER  *Liked* me. GEORGE  Kramer, they like everybody. They're friendly people.  KRAMER  No. I think I picked up on a vibe.  JERRY  You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.  KRAMER  Yeah, Jerry I'm telling you I have this power. And I have no control   over it.  Kramer leaves.  Jerry's girlfriend appears at the doorway. JERRY  Oh hi. JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.  JERRY  (weakly) A little better. *fake cough*  JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  If you need anything let me know. JERRY  Okay. All right bye. GEORGE  Story. JERRY  She's subletting Carol's place for a month.  GEORGE  She likes you. JERRY  Yeah but there's a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her   medicine cabinet. GEORGE  So? JERRY  So I don't know what she's using it for.  GEORGE  Well how do you even know it's hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol.   Did you see a name on the tube? JERRY  I didn't even think to look. GEORGE  Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.  JERRY  Yeah I've got this old bottle of cough medicine.  GEORGE  I still have brill cream.  At Jerry's girlfriend's apartment.  Jerry knocks on the door  *knock, knock, knock* JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  Hi. JERRY  Hi. Can I use your bathroom?  At the doctor's apartment. ELAINE  You sure you don't mind? DOCTOR  No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the   time. ELAINE  Well the question isn't even for me it's for a friend.  DOCTOR  Elaine, I'm used to it. I'm a doctor.  ELAINE  Well... podiatrist. DOCTOR  Huh? ELAINE  No no, I'm just saying you didn't really go to medical school, you   went to podiatry school. Which I'm sure is very grueling in it's own way.  DOCTOR  I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with   feet. ELAINE  I like feet too. I'm just saying... DOCTOR  Saying what?  In Jerry's girlfriend's apartment.  She knocks on the bathroom door.  *knock, knock, knock* JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  How are you doing in there? JERRY  Fine all done, just looking for the soap.   Jerry is looking around for the bottle of fungicide. JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  No soap? JERRY  No I don't see it.  Jerry finds the bottle of fungicide and picks it up. Jerry's girlfriend   enters the bathroom with soap. Hastily, Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in   his pocket. JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  (giving Jerry the soap) Here you go.   At George's parent's house.  George is in the bathroom with his Latvian Orthodox books.  *knock, knock, knock* ESTELLE  George what are you doing in there?  GEORGE  What? Nothing. FRANK  You've been in there an hour. ESTELLE  You don't feel well? GEORGE  I'm fine. ESTELLE  I want to know what you're doing in there.  GEORGE  Nothing. FRANK  George, open the door. GEORGE  No. ESTELLE  Georgie. GEORGE  No!  At Kramer's apartment.  Sister Roberta is knocking on the door.  *knock, knock, knock* KRAMER  Hey. SISTER ROBERTA  Good evening. I hope I'm not disturbing you, but I found   another toy I thought you might like.  (Commercial)  At Jerry's Apartment. JERRY  Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And I'll need that in the   form of a question. GEORGE  I don't know. I can't believe they're making me take this test.   Elaine enters. JERRY  Hey, did you talk to the doctor? ELAINE  No. JERRY  All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the   bottle of fungicide.) ELAINE  You *took* her medicine. JERRY  Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When   are you seeing him again? ELAINE  I don't know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists   aren't real doctors. JERRY  How could you say that? ELAINE  It's you fault. You just got me thinking.  JERRY  I was merely speaking extemporaneously.  ELAINE  I've got nothing against the foot. I'm pro-foot.  JERRY  Me too. ELAINE  Do you think I should call him and apologize?  JERRY  Yes. He's a doctor.  Elaine starts to leave. JERRY  Wait a second.  Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaine's purse. JERRY  (to George) What are you doing? GEORGE  What does it look like I'm doing? JERRY  (Reading words George wrote on his hand) \"Matthew, Luke, Paul\", what   you're cheating on your conversion chest?  Kramer enters. KRAMER  I told you. JERRY  What? KRAMER  I told you she liked me. JERRY  Who? KRAMER  Sister Roberta. JERRY  How do you know? KRAMER  She told me. She said she's never had a man stir up all of these   feelings inside of her. She's questioning her faith. She's thinking of   leaving the church. Oh, uh, this power. I'm dangerous Jerry, I'm very very   dangerous.  At the priest's office. FATHER-PRIEST  I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the results of   your conversion test. I don't recall having seen such an impressive   performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord.  GEORGE  Oh, I'm I'm full of it Father. FATHER-PRIEST 2  (muttering something to Father-Priest 1) ...(mumble)... Kramer   ...(mumble)... FATHER-PRIEST  Yes, yes I see. (To George) I'm sorry something has come up.  GEORGE  Oh, I understand.  Kramer enters. KRAMER  Um, you wanted to see me Father? FATHER-PRIEST  Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me   yesterday. KRAMER  I know what this is about Father. I didn't do anything. I just   spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. It's just that, that I have   this power. FATHER-PRIEST  Yes. Kavorka.  (I wouldn't mind having \"Kavorka\" myself ;) ) KRAMER  Kavorka? FATHER-PRIEST  It is a Latvian word which means \"the lure of the animal\".  KRAMER  I don't understand. FATHER-PRIEST  Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be   possessed by you. KRAMER  Help me Father. Help me. FATHER-PRIEST  Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you   to buy ten cloves of garlic, three quarts of vinegar, six ounces...   The hallway by Jerry's apartment. JERRY  What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramer's   door) Ah hah.  *knock, knock, knock*  Kramer opens his door. He is wearing a ring of garlics around his neck.  KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. What are you doing? KRAMER  I've got the Kavorka Jerry. JERRY  The Kavorka? What's that? KRAMER  The lure of the animal. I'm dangerous.  JERRY  What is this thing around your neck?  KRAMER  The priests they're helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.  JERRY  You know you're funcifying the whole building.  KRAMER  Keep away Jerry. Keep away.  He closes his door. JERRY  Kramer. *knock, knock, knock* Kramer.   +---------------------+  | CONVERSION CEREMONY |  | FOR |  | GEORGE COSTANZA | | 3  P.M. |  | |  | |  | |  +---------------------+  The sign is on a black background with white stick-on letters.   A woman reads the sign. WOMAN  George Costanza? Estelle's son?  At George's parent's house. ESTELLE  Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?  GEORGE  For a woman. FRANK  A woman? What are you out of your mind?  ESTELLE  Why can't you do anything like a normal person?  FRANK  Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?  GEORGE  No it's a regular religion. FRANK  I'm calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this.  GEORGE  I don't want to get out of it. ESTELLE  George, you don't know what you're saying. You're under their   control. FRANK  What, they brainwashed you? GEORGE  No no. FRANK  You're not performing any rituals in this house.  ESTELLE  Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.  FRANK  And stay away from those squirrels.   At Jerry's girlfriend's apartment. JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  Oh how you doing Jerry? JERRY  Good. What's the matter? JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  I'm tired. I hardly slept last night with all this   scratching. Bonkers was going crazy. JERRY  Bonkers? JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  My cat. He's got this weird sort of skin condition.   Some type of fungus, I couldn't find his medicine. JERRY  Oh it's your cat! JERRY'S GIRLFRIEND  What? JERRY  Ooh, nothing.  At the church. FATHER-PRIEST  Are you ready my son? GEORGE  Yes faddah. FATHER-PRIEST  What did you say? GEORGE  What? FATHER-PRIEST  I thought you said faddah. GEORGE  I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.   Outside on a sidewalk.  A woman is waiting for a cab. Kramer walks up to her. KRAMER  How you doing? WOMAN  Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)  KRAMER  Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta I've still got time to catch   her.  At the church. It is George's conversion ceremony.  Church music plays.  George is dressed in a white church gown.  He walks down the church aisle carrying a candle.  Father-priest says some Latvian words.  Kramer is running down the street going to the church.  The church music is still playing.  George takes a drink of some wine. He spills some on his gown. He makes a   hand motion on his gown.  Kramer is still running to the church.  The church music is still playing. FATHER-PRIEST  Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta   would you please offer the final benediction. SISTER ROBERTA  (hesitates) I can't. (crowd murmurs) I'm sorry. It's a   beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something else.   Kramer enters the church. SISTER ROBERTA  Him. CROWD  Kavorka, Kavorka.  At Elaine's apartment. ELAINE  *kiss, kiss* Because I love the foot. I'm a big fan of the foot.  DOCTOR  Well it's my fault. I got a little defensive.  ELAINE  And that pinkie toe, come on .

GEORGE  Well I didn't do it for my mother.  GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND  I'm really flattered. But I just don't feel ready to   make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia. GEORGE  Latvia? GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND  Yes. I'm going to stay with some relatives there for a   year. Isn't it great? GEORGE  Enjoy, enjoy. GEORGE'S GIRLFRIEND  Oh George, you are so sweet. Don't ever change.

(she's out of the bathroom now,          very satisfied, and walks towards          Jerry and     gives him the rolls)     ELAINE: here, take it   JANE     (walks out of the bathroom, very          furious) (to Jerry)     don't call me anymore     (Jerry doesn't say anything and          waves his hands)     (Jane walks by Kramer and turns          back)   JANE     (to Kramer, in a very sensual voice)     you either     (sticks her tongue out)     (Kramer and Jerry look at each          other, with their mouth open)   THE END>",

        "text": "   THE DINNER PARTY Written by   Larry David   (Comedy club)  We never should have landed a man on the moon. It's a mistake. Now everything is compared to that one accomplishment. I can't believe they could land a man on the moon . . . and taste my coffee! I think we all would have been a lot happier if they hadn't landed a man on the moon. Then we'd go, They can't make a prescription bottle top that's easy to open? I'm not surprised they couldn't land a man on the moon. Things make perfect sense to me now. Neil Armstrong should have said, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for every, complaining, sob on the face of the earth. \"   (Jerry's Apartment) ELAINE  Hey, do you believe I got happy new year today? It's February.  JERRY  I once got Happy new Year in July.  ELAINE  It's JERRY  It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?  ELAINE  It's really cold. JERRY  Scary cold. ELAINE  I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?   (George enters in Gore-Tex jacket) JERRY  That. ELAINE  Huh, What is that, ha? GEORGE  What? JERRY  When did you get that? GEORGE  This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?  JERRY  You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?  ELAINE  You can't even turn around in that thing.  JERRY  Look at this (start hitting George)  ELAINE  Hey George, can you feel this? (they are hitting his jacket)  GEORGE  All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.  ELAINE  Maybe we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.  GEORGE  What for? ELAINE  These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.  GEORGE  Why? ELAINE  Because it's rude, otherwise. GEORGE  You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?  ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  So you're telling me instead of being happy to see me they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. You see what I'm saying?  JERRY  The fabric of society is very complex George.  GEORGE  I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.  ELAINE  You can't bring Pepsi. GEORGE  Why not? ELAINE  Because we're adults? GEORGE  You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine is better than Pepsi.  JERRY  I'm telling you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi on the table.  GEORGE  I just don't like the ideas that every time there is a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.  JERRY  You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  All right, let's go. Who's driving?  JERRY  You are. I can't get that thing (George) in my car.   (In Kramer's car) JERRY  Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Give me a squeeze.  ELAINE  Get off of me. Get off of ME! JERRY  You're pretty comfortable up there eh. Bubble boy?  GEORGE  Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.  ELAINE  I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.  GEORGE  Oh, here we go. Why don't we get them a couch? Bring them a nice sectional.  ELAINE  We'll get some cake. Can you stop off at the bakery?  GEORGE  Why don't you just get some Ring Dings at the liquor store?  ELAINE  Ring Dings? GEORGE  Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you'll ever get at a bakery.  KRAMER  I like Ring Dings. ELAINE  George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.  KRAMER  HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! GEORGE  It's a funeral procession. . . . And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit at the party. People be coming up to me, \"just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .  ELAINE  Oh, wait a minute. There's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. Okay, let me out. You, whatever your name is...  JERRY  Jerry. ELAINE  Yeah, Jerry, come with me. KRAMER  Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.  ELAINE  Yeah. KRAMER  All right  (The Royal Bakery) ELAINE  Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.  JERRY  Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side (mumble?) It's a wonderful thing isn't it?  ELAINE  You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.  JERRY  I'm looking forward to it. ELAINE  Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.  JERRY  Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?  ELAINE  CHOCOLATE BOBKA! That's their specialty.  JERRY  Love that Bobka. ELAINE  Yeah, yeah! JERRY  So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.  ELAINE  Why? JERRY  I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.  ELAINE  You think it's effeminate? JERRY  It's a tad dainty. ELAINE  Oh, we forgot to pick a number. JERRY  You see that's not fair. We were here ahead of all these people.  ELAINE  You think I should go ask her for hers?  JERRY  No, forget it. ELAINE  No, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask them. Come on. . . . Excuse me.   (Kramer's car) KRAMER  Wow, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?  GEORGE  Just double park KRAMER  No GEORGE  Why not? KRAMER  I'll get a ticket! Besides,, what if somebody wants to get out of here?  GEORGE  Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give them up.  KRAMER  It's a fallacy. GEORGE  All right, I'll tell you what, why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?  KRAMER  Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?  GEORGE  Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.  KRAMER  So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heater'll be on.  GEORGE  Does the heater even work in this car?  KRAMER  No. GEORGE  Hey, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see  KRAMER  I see. GEORGE  You see, ho ho,  (Royal Bakery) ELAINE  But we were here ahead of you. BARBARA  How do I know that? JERRY  Well we saw you come in. YYY  Well, that's easy for you to say. ELAINE  Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in line at bakeries.  CLERK  46? ELAINE  Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?  BARBARA  Yes. ELAINE  Oh my god. I, I know you. Um, I'm Elaine Benes, you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.  BARBARA  I'm on my way over there right now.  ELAINE  Me too. D  You're Jerry right? JERRY  David! ELAINE  Well,, this is a little awkward, isn't it?  BARBARA  Yes it is. ELAINE  You know we were here ahead of you.  BARBARA  You're NOT getting my number. JERRY  Oh so you still don't believe us. CLERK  47! BARBARA  Us. ELAINE  Oh, oh, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.  BARBARA  Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what a jerk YOU are. . . . I'll have the chocolate Bobka.  CLERK  You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.   (Liquor Store) GEORGE  So alright, what are we getting? It's so hot in here!  KRAMER  What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?  GEORGE  What's that? KRAMER  It's robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais which is richer and fruitier. Here's one. Twelve dollars.  GEORGE  Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you they aren't getting no twelve dollar cake.  KRAMER  All right but I am going to have to pay you back latter I don't have my wallet.  GEORGE  . . . Why not? KRAMER  Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My osteopath says it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter  GEORGE  \"throws your hips off kilter\" So where's your money?  KRAMER  I never take it. GEORGE  So what do you do? KRAMER  Oh, I get by.  (Royal Bakery) BARBARA  See you later (exits with the Bobka)  ELAINE  /JERRY: See you later. JERRY  That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka.  ELAINE  I know. They're going in first with the last Bobka.  JERRY  That was our Bobka. ELAINE  You can't beat a Bobka. JERRY  We should have had that Bobka. ELAINE  They're going to be heroes. JERRY  What are we going to do now. If we can't get the Bobka the whole thing's useless.  ELAINE  Well how about a carrot cake? JERRY  Carrot cake? Now why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.  ELAINE  Black Forrest? JERRY  Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.  JERRY  How about a Napoleon? ELAINE  Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengle.  JERRY  That wa sour Bobka. We had that Bobka!  ELAINE  What's this one? CLERK  That's cinnamon Bobka. JERRY  Another Bobka? CLERK  There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.  JERRY  Well, we've got to get the cinnamon.  ELAINE  No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with a lesser Bobka.  JERRY  I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, \"Oh This is so good. What's in it?\" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser Bobka - I think not.  CLERK  49? ELAINE  I'll have the cinnamon Bobka. JERRY  ... and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!   (Liquor store) CLECK  That will be 13.05 GEORGE  All right here you go. CLERK  A hundred? I can't change that. GEORGE  You can't - oh uh oh All right let's go.  KRAMER  Wait a second. I can get change.  (Out on the street) KRAMER  Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?  GEORGE  Hey, hey What are you doing? You'll get us killed.  KRAMER  What? GEORGE  Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows after us.  KRAMER  Okay. Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.  GEORGE  I am not buying something just to get change.  KRAMER  George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.  KRAMER  All rright let's get some gum or something.  GEORGE  Pack of gum, okay here you go. CLERK  What I this a hundred? I can't change a hundred.  GEORGE  Why not? CLERK  You got to buy more than that. KRAMER  Here, get a newspaper. GEORGE  A newspaper. CLERK  That's not enough. KRAMER  A Clark Bar. GEORGE  Clark Bar. CLERK  Keep going. GEORGE  There's 22 dollars here. KRAMER  George, George, Get a Penthouse Forum.  GEORGE  I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.  KRAMER  That will make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.  GEORGE  Oh, that's nice. KRAMER  Hey, did you ever read one of these?  GEORGE  It's not real. They're all made up.  KRAMER  Oh, it's real. GEORGE  You know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.  CLERK  6.75. GEORGE  Ah, great. With the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.  MAN1  (gibberish Arabic yelling) GEORGE  Sorry, it's a new coat. It's Gore-Tex.  KRAMER  You better be careful with that thing. You'll start a war.   (Royal Bakery) JERRY  Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be solved.  ELAINE  Your views on race relations are fascinating. You really should do an op-ed piece for the Times.  JERRY  Um, um, Look to the cookie Elaine. Look to the cookie.  ELAINE  What is this? JERRY  What? ELAINE  It's a hair. JERRY  Oh, take it back. Let's get another one.  ELAINE  No, we've already got this. I'll just take it off.  JERRY  No, really, let's get another one. It will just take a second.  ELAINE  Excuse me. MAN  Hey hey, I'm in line here. ELAINE  No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a hair on it.  CLERK  You have to take a number. ELAINE  We waited fifteen minutes for this. Oh. YOU SOLD ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) are you going to wait here?  JERRY  Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.  ELAINE  It was a little hair. I took it off.  JERRY  A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?  ELAINE  What if it's your hair? JERRY  What if it's your hair? ELAINE  What is wrong with my hair? Nothing. Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.  JERRY  Who needs misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. A hundred proof - takes your roots out.  ELAINE  Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.  JERRY  Well, why don't we just forget about the cake?  ELAINE  No I'm bringing cake!  (Liquor store) GEORGE  All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Imagine if we didn't bring wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!  KRAMER  \"I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true...\" (exits to street) \" A weeks days ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive our new neighbor Linda was...\"  GEORGE  Look at this? Somebody double parked and blocked us in. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. No, no note. Can you believe this?  KRAMER  \"...well of course I noticed it too with those ample breasts and those pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out....\"   (still on street but much later) GEORGE  I really can't comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?  KRAMER  No, no I can't comprehend it? GEORGE  I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're basically still very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys who built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?  KRAMER  Yeah, he could build the rocket but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.  GEORGE  So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.  KRAMER  Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other part he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?  GEORGE  Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. If this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?  KRAMER  How about Idi Amin? GEORGE  Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parking. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!  KRAMER  Are those shoes comfortable? GEORGE  No not really. KRAMER  They look comfortable. GEORGE  I know that's why I bought them but they're not comfortable.   (Royal Bakery) ELAINE  Why couldn't we have just taken the hair off and go?  JERRY  No, out of the question. ELAINE  Why? JERRY  Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.  ELAINE  What happened? JERRY  I'd rather not talk about it. ELAINE  You can't tell me? JERRY  All right . . . I once had a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.  ELAINE  You found a hair in your Farina? JERRY  Yeah, ELAINE  What happened? JERRY  I started screaming, \"There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina.\" Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. I was little but I could run very fast. I just kept running and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.  ELAINE  Wow. Who's hair was it? JERRY  My mother's. CLERK  68! ELAINE  That's us. JERRY  Oh, good. ELAINE  You sold us a hair with a cake around it. I'd like another one.  CLERK  (coughing and coughing) JERRY  Ah, that's lovely. ELAINE  Ah, JERRY  Just what you want to see, yeah. . . . You want to trade your hair for some phlegm  CLERK  Here you are. ELAINE  Um, okay, we got the cake now. Where are George and Kramer?   (on street outside Liquor Store)  (honking) KRAMER  HEY DOUBLE-PARKER. SOVIET SCUM. COME ON OUT. IT'S FREEZING!  GEORGE  We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.  KRAMER  Why? GEORGE  You know, Elaine. KRAMER  What about her? GEORGE  . . . I'm a little scared of her. KRAMER  You're scared of Elaine? GEORGE  Yes! KRAMER  Why? GEORGE  Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late because I bought a Panama hat she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.  KRAMER  Let's go inside the liquor store. It's freezing in here.  GEORGE  Why didn't you wear a heavier coat?  KRAMER  Because I wanted to look good for the party.  GEORGE  Hey, hey that's great! That's very nice. We've been waiting twenty minutes for you people? What do you think? You're Mussolini?  MAN2  Back off puff ball it's not my car!  GEORGE  I wasn't talking to you.  (Royal Bakery) ELAINE  Wait until I get my hands on that George. I'm going to pull that big hood over his little head, tie the string and suffocate him. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.  JERRY  Uh, wa? ELAINE  What's the matter with you? JERRY  Uh, I don't feel so good. ELAINE  What's wrong? JERRY  My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie.  ELAINE  The black and white? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Not getting along? JERRY  I think I got David Duke and Fahrikan down there.  ELAINE  Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?  JERRY  I feel like I'm going to throw up.  ELAINE  Hey, what about your vomit streak?  JERRY  I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.   (Man with cane puts cane on Elaine's foot) ELAINE  Oh, oh! MAN3  Sooory. ELAINE  Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC!... uh, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) Where're you going?  JERRY  Fourteen years down the drain.  (Liquor Store) GEORGE  Do chickens have individual personalities?  KRAMER  (shivering) I don't care. GEORGE  If you had five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Cluck, puk cluck? Because if they have individual personalities I don't think we should be eating them. What's the matter with you?  CLERK  Can I help you guys with anything?  GEORGE  We bought the wine here before, but now we're blocked in by some car that's double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.  CLERK  Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout. But my friend here has hypothermia.  KRAMER  I've got hypothermia. CLERK  All right guys, take it outside.  (George turns and breaks wine bottles) CLERK  You're paying for these.  (Royal bakery) ELAINE  How was it? JERRY  As good as it gets.  (Outside Liquor Store) GEORGE  You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It was worth a hell of a lot more than that cheap Chardonnay.  KRAMER  I'm freezing. Definitely freezing. I can't stop shaking.  GEORGE  I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.  GEORGE  Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. MAN4  Don't walk around without a coat in this weather; you'll catch your death of cold. So long.  CLERK  Can I get you anything else? JERRY  Oh, no thanks. CLERK  How about a nice box of \"scram\".  (George enters) GEORGE  Somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He had a British accent though. What, what happened to you?  ELAINE  Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your ....  JERRY  Hey, what happened to your coat? And what's the smell, what are you drunk?  GEORGE  I had to give it to the liquor store guy.  JERRY  What for? GEORGE  I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get?  ELAINE  Cinnamon Bobka. GEORGE  Cinnamon? Why didn't you get chocolate?  JERRY  George!  (In the car)  (silence)  (Apartment #7) ELAINE  Here, here's your cake. GEORGE  And your wine. ELAINE  See ya'. JERRY  See ya'.  (Comedy club) JERRY  I heard a weather man say that 75% of your body heat is actually lost through the top of the top of the head. Which sounds like you could go skiing naked if you got a good hat. But there's no hat that makes a statement quite like a hat with a flap. The hat with the flaps makes a statement like no other hat makes. This hat says to the world \"I would rather have the heat in my skull rather than anything society could possibly offer.\" In fact I would say if you're on trial for a serious crime and you lawyer recommends the insanity defense, this is the hat to wear. Your lawyer should insist on it. [puts on the hat] Your honor, \"The defense rests.\" THE END>",

JERRY  But see look at the collar, see it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly   dying. Each wash is brings him one step closer, that's what makes   the T-shirts such a tragic figure. ELAINE  Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some   Woolight? JERRY  No!!! The reason he's iron man is because he goes out there and plays   every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!!

I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)  ELAINE  Where'd you get this? KRAMER  The bank, I opened a new account.  (Back inside Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  Did you see that whale thing on TV last night?  JERRY  No. GEORGE  I'm such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showing how   they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what   a fish! JERRY  It's a mammal. GEORGE  Whatever.

Ya know what ever happened to your friend   George? I never see him in there. JERRY  Well he's kind of modest. DIANE  He was always such a goof-off. I mean did he ever get anywhere?  JERRY  Sure. DIANE  Yeah? What field? JERRY  Marine biology. DIANE  George is a marine biologist?! JERRY  A pretty damn good one, too! DIANE  I can't believe it I mean I would never had thought..  JERRY  Yeah...he specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the   cholesterol level in whales...all that blubber-- quite unhealthy.   You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says \"they   don't have to be.\"  (In the coffee shop Jerry and George are sitting) GEORGE  Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!  JERRY  Something huh? GEORGE  Yeah! How'd she look. JERRY  She looked great. She asked about you.  GEORGE  She did! What did she say? JERRY  \"How's George?\" GEORGE  George! She said George? She remembered my name. Diane DeConn   remembered my name. She was the \"it\" girl! JERRY  Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with   you. GEORGE  OK, I'm tellin' you right now if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna   be able to be friends with you anymore. I'm serious about that. You   got that. JERRY  I got no problem with that. GEORGE  Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your   idea of some cute little game...we're finished! JERRY  Expect a call. GEORGE  Oh my god he's not kidding. JERRY  Now I should tell you at this point she's under the impression the   you are a..... GEORGE  A what? JERRY  A marine biologist. GEORGE  A marine biologist....why am I a marine biologist?  JERRY  I may have mentioned it. GEORGE  But I'm not a marine biologist! JERRY  I'm aware of that. GEORGE  So? JERRY  You don't think it's a good job. GEORGE  I didn't think it was a job. JERRY  Oh. It's a fascinating field! GEORGE  What if she calls. What will I say?   (In George's parent's house...George is sitting in a chair. He is talking to   Diane on the phone) GEORGE  Algae, obviously plankton, I don't know what else I can tell you, Oh   I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living   with the turtles.  (In the limo Elaine, Lippman, and Testikov are talkin') LIPPMAN  We have got you in a very nice hotel, I don't know how you like to   work but I can arrange for an office if you want. TESTIKOV  I will work in hotel...much better. I will work away from all the   penny bickering and interference. LIPPMAN  You know Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces   inspired him. TESTIKOV  He didn't need any inspiration....God spoke through his pen.  ELAINE  That is so true! Although one wonders if \"War and Peace\" would has   been as highly acclaimed as it was if it was published under it's   original name \"War---What Is It Good For?\" LIPPMAN  What? ELAINE  Yes. Mr. Lippman. It was his mistress who insisted he called it   \"War and Peace.\" \"War--What Is It Good For.\"(sang) Absolutely   nothin'! (spoken to Testikov)that's the song that they got from   Tolstoy. LIPPMAN  I'm sorry, it's just her sense of humor.   (Elaine's organizer starts beeping) TESTIKOV  What is that noise! LIPPMAN  What is that? ELAINE  It's coming from my purse. It must be my new organizer, here.  LIPPMAN  Elaine...here! TESTIKOV  Turn it off. LIPPMAN  It's the top one! ELAINE  I'm trying! TESTIKOV  HERE!  (He throws it out the window of the limo)  (On the beach Kramer is getting ready to hit a ball. He swings and misses.   He looks for it in the air and the notes that it is still on the   ground. Then he goes nuts) JERRY  I did it for you. GEORGE  Yeah, but what did you have to tell her that for. You put me in a   very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable   with this whole thing. JERRY  You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.  GEORGE  Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know   what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands   livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am. JERRY  Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the   squeaking and the squealing. GEORGE  Why couldn't you have made me an architect? You know I always   wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I'm supposed to see   her tomorrow, I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. Maybe she likes   me for me.  (Kramer bangs into the room with his golf clubs) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs) I don't want em!  JERRY  What? KRAMER  I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and   I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out!  JERRY  Well what happened? KRAMER  I have no concentration!  (Kramer starts to scratch his body and rip his coat off) JERRY  What, what, what's wrong with you?  KRAMER  Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (Looking down his shirt) Look there   is still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the   pockets!  (He empties his pocket and tons of sand falls out) JERRY  Hey you're getting it all over the floor!   (Karma falls over as the phone rings) JERRY  (to the phone)Hello....yeah....yes it is....really....oh. Can you   hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some   woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me   to help track down the owner. GEORGE  How'd she find it? JERRY  It hit her in the head!  (Woman on the phone and Jerry are sitting in the coffee shop)  CORINNE  So I am walkin' along, minding my own business when all off the   sudden this thing come flying out off no were and cunks me right on   the head. JERRY  Ya. CORINNE  Yeah, So they took me to the hospital and they put me in this thing   that fells like a coffin for forty-five minutes. Have you ever been   in one of those things? You could go berserk in there! JERRY  Well you have insurance... CORINNE  I wish! JERRY  Unbelievable! CORINNE  Yeah.  (Organizer beeps) JERRY  What is with this thing. CORINNE  I don't know, it never shuts up. So anyway, you can see why I   would be interested in finding this person. JERRY  Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.   (Organizer beeps again) CORINNE  (shouting at the top of her lungs)Stop it! Stop it!  JERRY  Let me have a look at this thing. CORINNE  Yeah know somebody told me they thought they saw it coming out of   a limousine. JERRY  Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.  CORINNE  Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button.  JERRY  I would like to know what my name is doin in this creep's organizer   to begin with. CORINNE  Ya. JERRY  Who do I even know that would have been in a limousine yesterday   anyway. OHHHH!  (In the hallway Elaine knocks on Kramer's door, he answers)  KRAMER  Oh, hey. ELAINE  Hey, \"great\" organizer that you gave me.   (Kramer is still itching cause the sand) KRAMER  Oh, you like it huh. ELAINE  It wouldn't stop beeping in the car so Testikov through it out the   window. KRAMER  Oh. ELAINE  I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm   lost now, Kramer.  (He goes crazy again) ELAINE  What, what is it? KRAMER  The sand, it's everywhere! ELAINE  OK I'll see you later.  (Kramer closes the door and Jerry walks up to his door) JERRY  Oh, there you are! ELAINE  There you are! JERRY  So? ELAINE  So? JERRY  So what do you have to say for yourself?  ELAINE  So what do you have to say for yourself?   (Jerry unlocks the door and they both walk in and close the door)  JERRY  Why should I have anything for say for myself?  ELAINE  \"War-- What is it go for?\"! JERRY  Ha Ha, who told you? ELAINE  Ha ha ha. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!  JERRY  You told Testikov that Tolstoy wanted to name his book \"War-- What   Is IT Good For?\"? ELAINE  Ya know what happened? JERRY  Can I take a guess? ELAINE  Please. JERRY  Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?   (Elaine pushes Jerry) ELAINE  What, how did you know that? JERRY  Because I know who has it. ELAINE  What, how did you find it? JERRY  Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name in   it, called me up, and we met! ELAINE  Well where is it, give it to me! JERRY  I don't have it! ELAINE  Why not. JERRY  Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the   hospital bill. ELAINE  But I didn't do Testikov did it, he should have to pay for it!  JERRY  How much is Testikov getting from Pendman for this book?  ELAINE  One million. JERRY  Well that's a start.  (George and Diane are walking on the beach) GEORGE  Then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils and took   on the more familiar look that we know today. But if you look   really closely you can still see a bump where the nose use to be.  DIANE  Really? GEORGE  Yeah, but enough about fish I can talk about other things like...   architecture...  (At the hotel that Testikov is staying at) JERRY  You know what room Testikov's in? ELAINE  Ya, 308. I'm crazy for doing this!  JERRY  Well, you want to get your organizer back don't you?  ELAINE  Why are you so interested, you want to take her out?  JERRY  You know when Super Man saves someone no one asks if he's trying to   hit on her! ELAINE  Well you're not Super Man. JERRY  Well you're not Louis Lane. ELAINE  Oh. Listen, you have the tape-recorder.  JERRY  Ya, are you sure you want to do this.  ELAINE  Ya I got to get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the   \"New England Journal Of Medicine\" I'm not going to pay for it.  JERRY  Ah, here she comes.  (Corinne enters through the hotel door) JERRY  Hi, Elaine, this is Corinne. ELAINE  Hi, you got the organizer?  (The organizer starts to beep as Corinne opens her coat to show the organizer in her inside coat pocket)  JERRY  All right lets go. We'll meet you back here in ten minutes hopefully   with the money.  (At the beach George and Diane are still walking) DIANE  Your parents must be so proud of you, George.  GEORGE  Oh, they're busting!  (there is a large crowd of men and women) DIANE  What are those people doing over there?   (In Testikov's hotel room there is a knock and he goes to answer it. He   opens it up and it is Jerry and Elaine) TESTIKOV  (In a loud and cranky voice) What, What is it! Oh! Come in. That   is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring   guest for my entertainment? ELAINE  Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. He accompanied me, ya know, single   woman alone in a big city could be dangerous. JERRY  Yes. That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble and   zip, I'm gone. TESTIKOV  Yeah, Yeah. The sneakers. The Americans and their sneakers.   Always running from something. Well, sit stop running, two minutes   and I'll give you the latest manuscript!  (They both sit down and Jerry picks out a very large book from the coffee   table) JERRY  Oh! Ramscy(?), great great book if I my say so sir. I almost read the   whole thing.  (Corinne is standing in the hotel lobby smoking while the organizer is still   beeping) CORINNE  What! HOTEL CLERK  If you can't thing off I'm going to have to ask you to leave.  CORINNE  I'm waitin for two people! HOTEL CLERK  Well you can wait for them outside.  CORINNE  Yeah I guess I'd better. Wouldn't want to take any attention away   from the hookers! HOTEL CLERK  All right, All right. Out, Out. CORINNE  What ever you say Cro..w-well!  (On the beach George and Diane are standing with the crowd)  DIANE  What's going on over here? WOMAN AT BEACH  There is a beached whale, she's dying.  VOICE  Is anyone here a marine biologist?   (In Testikov's room) TESTIKOV  Here is the latest draft. I see you next week. Same time, same   place. On time please. JERRY  It was nice meeting you, real pleasure!  ELAINE  Oh, by the way Mr. Testikov do you remember the other day when we   were in the limo and my organizer started beeping and you threw it   out the window? TESTIKOV  How could I forget? ELAINE  Well would you believe that it hit actually somebody in the head.  JERRY  Right in the head! ELAINE  Boing!  (The tape-recorder in Elaine's purse starts to squeak) TESTIKOV  (Shouting)What is that noise! ELAINE  Um ,nothing. TESTIKOV  What is the noise!  (He grabs the purse) ELAINE  Hey that's my purse!  (He pulls out the recorder) TESTIKOV  A recorder! ELAINE  No that's a radio.. TESTIKOV  You were spying on me! ELAINE  No I wasn't.  (He throws the recorder out of the hotel window)  (Corinne is standing outside of the hotel and looks up to see the   tape-recorder falling to hit her in the head)  (Kramer is standing at his window knocking his boot on the windowsill trying   to get the sand out but he drops it)  (Newman is walking down the street whistling but he stops and looks up and he   yells as the boat hits him in the head)  (At the beach everyone is yelling at George) CROWD  Come on! Save the whale! Hurry up it's gonna die!  DIANE  Save the whale George... for me.  (He turns and throws his hat down. He walks into the ocean)   (At the coffee shop Jerry and Kramer are awaiting the story)  GEORGE  So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I   was terrified! But I pressed on and as I made my way passed the   breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine   intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry   at that moment I was a marine biologist!  (Elaine enters and sits down) ELAINE  George I was just reading this thing in the papers, it's amazing!  GEORGE  I know I was just telling them the story.  KRAMER  Come on George, finish the story. GEORGE  The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man trying to   return soup at a deli!  (Jerry gives Kramer a \"what the h-\" glance) GEORGE  I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great beast   appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a   foot. As if sensing my presence he gave out a big bellow. I said,   \"Easy big fella!\" And then as I watched him struggling I realized   something was obstructing his breathing. From where I was standing   I could see directly into the eye of the great fish! JERRY  Mammal. GEORGE  Whatever. KRAMER  Well, what did you do next? GEORGE  Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!   (George pulls out of the inside pocket a golf ball)  (Jerry and George just stare at Kramer) KRAMER  What is that a Titleist? A hole in one eh.  JERRY  Well the crowd most have gone wild!  GEORGE  Oh yes they did Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1.   Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me, and kissed me. We   both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so   beautiful. It was at that moment I decided to tell her I was not a   marine biologist! JERRY  Wow! What'd she say? GEORGE  She told me to \"Go to hell!\" and I took the bus home.  JERRY  All right lets go. ELAINE  Are you in a bad mood? JERRY  No, I just got my laundry back. ELAINE  Ohhh! GoldenBoy? JERRY  He didn't make it. ELAINE  I'm sorry. JERRY  This is GoldenBoy's son, BabyBlue.  KRAMER  What's with you? GEORGE  Sand. It's everywhere   THE END>",

That was really good! JERRY  Yeah. Are you full? AUDREY  Oh no, I've had just enough.  (Waitress brings dessert) JERRY  Here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.  AUDREY  No thanks. JERRY  You're not gonna have any? AUDREY  No (with a disgusted face) JERRY  Do you not like apple pie? AUDREY  No, it's not that. JERRY  Well, at least taste it. AUDREY  No (a resolute \"no\") JERRY  You won't even taste it? AUDREY  No. JERRY  Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing \"no\") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on! (still shaking)   (scene ends)  (Jerry's appartment, the next day)  (Jerry and George) GEORGE  Did she say why? JERRY  No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)  GEORGE  Maybe she's diabetic. JERRY  No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.  GEORGE  Maybe you said something that offended her.  JERRY  The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.  GEORGE  Like at the airport? (getting excited)  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  That's a great idea!!! JERRY  Tell me about it! GEORGE  We could be zipping all over the place.  JERRY  They could at least try it. GEORGE  They never try anything. JERRY  What's the harm? GEORGE  No harm!  (Elaine enters) JERRY  (still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.  ELAINE  Who wouldn't taste a pie? JERRY  Audrey. ELAINE  Dump her. JERRY  Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???  ELAINE  (piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.  JERRY  You did? ELAINE  He could be eating a Hero, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.  GEORGE  Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?  ELAINE  I got a pebble. JERRY  Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?  ELAINE  What the hell does that mean?  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)  ELAINE  What? Why? KRAMER  Do it. Do it. This. ELAINE  Like... (doing it) Like this? KRAMER  Oh yeah! It's you! ELAINE  What's me? KRAMER  (to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.  ELAINE  Get out! KRAMER  It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.  GEORGE  Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?  KRAMER  Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...  JERRY  (to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)  KRAMER  It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it.  GEORGE  Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?  KRAMER  Real Boss! ELAINE  I'm going down there. GEORGE  I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.  ELAINE  (grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.  GEORGE  All right. All right. (They both leave)  KRAMER  (leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?  JERRY  Keep it. (implied: please)  (scene ends)  (Rinitze)  (George and Elaine stares at the mannequin) ELAINE  It looks exactly like me. GEORGE  It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.  ELAINE  What's going on here? How do you think this happened?  GEORGE  Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?  ELAINE  You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?   (the saleswoman approaches George as he's trying the suit) SALESWOMAN  (european accent) You are perfect for that suit.  GEORGE  You think so? ELAINE  (to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?  SALESWOMAN  I don't know. GEORGE  You really think this looks O.K. on me?  SALESWOMAN  Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have.  ELAINE  I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?  SALESWOMAN  I told you, I don't know. ELAINE  (irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?  SALESWOMAN  Why? ELAINE  Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.   (saleswoman rolls her eyes at George about Elaine) ELAINE  (upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.  SALESWOMAN  I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a 1200$ Gaultier dress.   (George is looking at himself in the mirror and doesn't care about their dispute)  ELAINE  What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.   (Elaine leaves and waits outside) SALESWOMAN  What is her problem? GEORGE  Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?  SALESWOMAN  Yes. GEORGE  Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)  SALESWOMAN  I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price.  GEORGE  So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?  SALESWOMAN  Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.  GEORGE  Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)   (scene ends)  (Monk's)  (Jerry, Elaine and Kramer at a booth) ELAINE  So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.  KRAMER  How did they get your face? ELAINE  I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?  JERRY  (Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.  WOMAN 1  That's right. JERRY  And you waved it away. WOMAN 2  Right. JERRY  Did you give her a reason? WOMAN 2  Yes, I was full. JERRY  You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.  WOMAN 2  No, I'm not a psycho. JERRY  Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.  ELAINE  We certainly have. KRAMER  Hey, Elaine scratch my back. ELAINE  No way! KRAMER  Come on, one lap around. ELAINE  No. KRAMER  It will be a funky adventure. ELAINE  Kramer, forget it. KRAMER  Jerry, how about you? JERRY  I think you know my policy. KRAMER  I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)  ELAINE  I thought George was meeting us here?  JERRY  No he's going downtown to guard the suit.  ELAINE  He's guarding a suit? OLIVE  (to Kramer) Do you need some help with that itch?  KRAMER  Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.  OLIVE  Turn around. KRAMER  Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)   (scene ends)  (Rinitze) SALESWOMAN  (makes a guy trying the suit. His name is not mentionned but it seems to be Bob as it appears in the credits at the end of the episode.) It fits you perfectly.  BOB  You think so? (she nods and walks away)  GEORGE  (outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?  BOB  I'm buying the suit. GEORGE  No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)  BOB  Excuse me, do you work here? GEORGE  (leaving the european accent) No. BOB  Then what the hell business is it of yours?  GEORGE  Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.  BOB  Really? This Monday? GEORGE  Yes. Now take off those pants. SALESWOMAN  Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday.  BOB  Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)  GEORGE  (to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.   (she starts undressing mannequin Elaine, and George acts like he's really seeing Elaine naked)   (scene ends)  (Poppie's restaurant)  (Jerry and Audrey are sitting at a table, and Jerry looks at the menu)  JERRY  I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?  AUDREY  Everything is delicious. JERRY  You've tasted them? AUDREY  Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.  JERRY  Oh I see they have apple pie. AUDREY  Mmm-hmm. JERRY  You've had the apple pie? AUDREY  Many times. JERRY  Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.  AUDREY  Can we drop this? JERRY  (like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?   (Poppie comes to the table) AUDREY  Ah! Poppie. POPPIE  Sweetheart, hello. AUDREY  Poppie, this is Jerry. POPPIE  Welcome (shakes Jerry's hand) JERRY  Hello Poppie. POPPIE  Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves)  JERRY  The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)   (Jerry and Poppie in the bathroom. Jerry washes his hands while Poppie flushes and gets out of the stall)  POPPIE  Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.   (He zips up and leaves whitout washing his hands. Jerry notices it)   (back at the table with Audrey, Jerry can see Poppie in the kitchen with his hands in the dough, making dinner)  AUDREY  Jerry are you OK? JERRY  Huh? AUDREY  Is anything wrong? JERRY  No, Nothing. AUDREY  You look like you've seen a ghost.   (Jerry can't talk and he's staring at Poppie's hands. Poppie smiles and winks at him)   (scene ends)  (Monk's) OLIVE  (to another cashier) I'll see you tomorrow.   (Kramer enters with flowers) KRAMER  Hey. These are for you Olive. OLIVE  Thank you.  (They leave and she starts scratching Kramer's back) KRAMER  Ohh!  (scene ends)  (Poppie's)  (Poppie serves dinner) POPPIE  Here it is. AUDREY  Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.  POPPIE  (to Jerry) Well? AUDREY  Jerry have some.  (Jerry shakes his head doing \"no\") AUDREY  You're not gonna taste it?  (still shaking) AUDREY  Jerry.  (still shaking)  (scene ends)  (Jerry's appartment)  (Jerry and George eat cereals sitting on the couch) JERRY  So she tought I did it to get back at her  GEORGE  Why didn't you just tell her? JERRY  I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.  GEORGE  How could he not have washed? JERRY  Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.  GEORGE  Yeah, just like I do. JERRY  You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.  GEORGE  Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti?  JERRY  We haven't spoken.  (Kramer enters holding the spatula) KRAMER  Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)  GEORGE  Olive? KRAMER  Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.  GEORGE  I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.  KRAMER  Is that Elaine mannequin still there?  GEORGE  Yeah. The last time I saw her, she was naked.  JERRY  Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...   (scene ends)  (Rinitze)  (The saleswoman unlock the door's entrance where Bob is waiting. He rushes inside and George enters after him slowly and confident. Bob can't find the suit on the rack. George walks to a different rack.)  BOB  Where is it? Where is it? GEORGE  (George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.  BOB  You bastard! You hid the suit. GEORGE  Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.  BOB  I hope you rot in that suit. I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!  GEORGE  Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.   (scene ends)  (Monks)  (Jerry and Elaine at a booth) ELAINE  So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.  JERRY  Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)  ELAINE  There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.  JERRY  Hum... ok, what else you got? ELAINE  OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.  JERRY  Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?  ELAINE  Because you have an attitude.  (George enters wearing his new suit, parading and snapping his fingers)  JERRY AND ELAINE  Oh! JERRY  Georgio! Nice duds! GEORGE  You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?  JERRY  Did you hear something? ELAINE  Yeah, like a swoosh. JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.   (George walks back and forth to verify and it swooshes again)  GEORGE  I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!  JERRY  So what? What would they care? GEORGE  This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.  JERRY  So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?  GEORGE  Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?  JERRY  You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.   (Kramer comes back from the bathroom) KRAMER  Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.  JERRY  Audrey? KRAMER  Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.  JERRY  Was it apple? KRAMER  What else? JERRY  This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!   (a stranger stops and looks at Elaine) STRANGER  Do I know you? ELAINE  Hmm... No you don't. STRANGER  Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.  ELAINE  The mannequin! JERRY  Oh, I got to see this thing.  (scene ends)  (Rinitze)  (Jerry and Elaine enter and see the mannequin getting spanked by another mannequin)  JERRY  Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.  (Elaine goes to the saleswoman) ELAINE  You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!  SALESWOMAN  It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it.  ELAINE  No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.  SALESWOMAN  (to Jerry) Yeah? What law am I breaking?  JERRY  Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,  ELAINE  Uh-huh JERRY  The Charlie Macarthy hearings. ELAINE  Uh-huh. Are you taking this down? SALESWOMAN  I'm getting the manager. (she leaves)  ELAINE  Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)  JERRY  What are you doing? ELAINE  Just get the car! JERRY  Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.   (They get out with the mannequin)  (scene ends)  (Jerry's car)  (Jerry and Elaine are sitting in the car with the mannequin between them. Jerry looks at the two Elaines beside him.)  JERRY  I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right?  ELAINE  Where are you going? JERRY  Poppie's  (scene ends)  (a restaurant)  (George with MacKenzie and two other businessmen are walking to a table)  MACKENZIE  Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, (George's pants are making noise) phones ringing, people running in and out. (MacKenzie stops talking and walking, George too) Did you hear something?  GEORGE  No, I didn't hear anything. MACKENZIE  Huh, that's strange. (they start walking again) It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he stops again, George too) That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?  GEORGE  No, can't say as I did. MACKENZIE  Kind of like a... rustling. GEORGE  Could be the leaves...  (scene ends)  (Poppie's)  (Audrey talks to a client on the phone) AUDREY  That's right. Poppie's on 77th. Ok we'll see you at 8:00. Bye-bye.  JERRY  Hello. AUDREY  What are you doing here? JERRY  So how was the pie? AUDREY  What pie? JERRY  The apple pie you had today at Monks  AUDREY  I'm very busy here. JERRY  Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.  AUDREY  You better not let Poppie see you here.   (a man in a coat, a Health Inspector, comes to Audrey) HEALTH INSPECTOR  All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie.  AUDREY  Uh, who are you? HEALTH INSPECTOR  Board of health, we've had several complaints.  JERRY  Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)  HEALTH INSPECTOR  Are you Poppie? POPPIE  I'm Poppie. HEALTH INSPECTOR  I think you'd better come with me.  POPPIE  What's the problem?  (Poppie leaves with the Health Inspector) AUDREY  What do they want from Poppie? JERRY  Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.  (scene ends)  (at the restaurant with MacKenzie)  (everybody's laughing at the table) MACKENZIE  You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?  GEORGE  I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.  MACKENZIE  No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place.  GEORGE  No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.   (The waiter brings dessert) WAITER  Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house.  MACKENZIE  Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.  WAITER  (to George) The chef said that he made it special for you.  GEORGE  Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant: it's Bob!)  MACKENZIE  Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. (George shakes his head doing \"no\") Well, take a bite. It's delicious. (still shaking) I insist. (still shaking)  BUSINESSMAN  If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.   (still shaking)  (scene ends)  (Monk's)  (evening, George, Jerry and Kramer at a booth, Olive at the cash)  JERRY  So you didn't get the job. GEORGE  No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.  JERRY  Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.  KRAMER  What am I supposed to say? JERRY  Tell her you lost your itch. GEORGE  What happened to your itch? KRAMER  I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.  JERRY  Well you should tell her. KRAMER  I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.  OLIVE  What? KRAMER  Uh, well, there's someone else. OLIVE  Someone else? KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, yeah... OLIVE  Who is she? KRAMER  Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)  OLIVE  her? KRAMER  Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.  OLIVE  You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend.  KRAMER  Now Olive, look, I'm sorry. OLIVE  Why is she wearing her underwear? KRAMER  Well, it's a style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.   (Kramer gets into Jerry's car and starts making out with the mannequin while Olive is looking through the window. But it doesn't work quite as good as Kramer was hoping cause the mannequin's hand fall out from the arm!)   (Commercials cut the scene but we assume Kramer left with Jerry's car and the mannequin. Jerry and George are still at the table, eating dessert)  GEORGE  Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?  JERRY  No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.   (Elaine enters and sit with Jerry and George. Olive is looking at her, confused.)  ELAINE  You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who's shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?   (scene ends)  (The building where Ricky works. Ricky's the guy in \"The Cigar Store Indian\" who made a bouquet for Elaine from Frank's TV guide.)  RICKY'S BOSS  Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your TR-6 mannequin.  RICKY  TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine. THE END>",

You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. When it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa. (acts like he is trying to get out of a car and makes the sound of a bus/guy starting to get going)   (Jerry and George on a Bus) GEORGE  It's just not good, it's not good.  JERRY  It's not good. GEORGE  I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.  JERRY  Well at breakfast everybody reads.  GEORGE  No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.  JERRY  You read during lunch? GEORGE  Ya JERRY  Oh, well. GEORGE  There's nothing to talk about. JERRY  Ya, what's there to talk about. GEORGE  Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.  JERRY  Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?  GEORGE  She knows there is nothing to talk about.  JERRY  At least you'll be talking. GEORGE  Oh shut up.  (Al comes onto the bus) AL  Hey, look who's here. JERRY  Hey, Al. GEORGE  Hey, Al. How's it going? AL  (extremely happy) Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk about. Sometimes we'll talk all night, till the sun comes up (pauses in his happiness; to George) so how about you?  GEORGE  Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.  AL  Great girl. GEORGE  We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.  JERRY  Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower. AL  (to Jerry) Oh did you hear about Fulton?  JERRY  Ya. AL  I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago (looking at Jerry) think he'd really like you to come visit.  JERRY  Me? AL  Ya, he said he could use a good laugh.  GEORGE  What about me? AL  (to George) He didn't mention you. (Looks toward the front of the bus) This is my stop. Uh see ya.  GEORGE  Ya JERRY  Ya, see ya.  (Al leaves) GEORGE  Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.  JERRY  (points to George) Ya.  (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and George enter the apartment) GEORGE  I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.  JERRY  Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.  GEORGE  Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.  JERRY  Oh, stop it. GEORGE  Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?  JERRY  So you're not gonna come? GEORGE  No but say hello for me.  (Kramer and Mickey enter) KRAMER  Hey! JERRY  Hey! Hey Mick. MICKEY  Hey Jerry. KRAMER  What's doing? JERRY  Nothing, what's doing with you? KRAMER  Same old, same old. JERRY  George this is Mickey. GEORGE  Hi, nice to meet you.  (George and Mickey shake hands) MICKEY  Pleasure. JERRY  How's work going you guys? MICKEY  Lets not even talk about it. GEORGE  (to Kramer) You got a job? KRAMER  Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.  MICKEY  (to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for, he's growing. He was four feet last month, now he's like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two, four-three is a stretch, any higher than that and I'm gonna be out on my ass doing that paralegal crap.  JERRY  How do you stop a kid from growing?  KRAMER  (to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.  MICKEY  I offered him cigarettes, (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She won't let him have any.  KRAMER  (to Mickey) What about lifts? MICKEY  (to Kramer) Out of the question. GEORGE  (to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?   (Mickey grabs the counter with rage on his face, Jerry does a form of gulp)  MICKEY  (turns and moves up to George, points his finger at him) It's little people, you got that?  KRAMER  Easy Mickey, easy. GEORGE  Yap.. KRAMER  All right we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?  JERRY  I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.  KRAMER  (on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.   (Kramer and Mickey leave Jerry's apartment and enter the hallway)  KRAMER  Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.  MICKEY  Lifts?! Look Kramer you don't understand, this kind of thing is just not done.  KRAMER  You wanna keep your job don't you?  MICKEY  Ya but..  (Kramer interrupts him) KRAMER  YAH! No Buts MICKEY  Kramer  (Kramer interrupts again) KRAMER  (with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!   (Fulton's Hospital Room)  (Fulton lying in the Hospital Bed, Jerry Enters) JERRY  Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me. FULTON  Hey Jerry, good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh.  JERRY  Who couldn't. FULTON  I haven't cracked a smile in months.  JERRY  Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.  FULTON  It's a fine time. JERRY  Oh, all right ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....   (Monk's)  (George and Daphne sitting in a booth reading the paper) GEORGE  (sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?  DAPHNE  Eggs are eggs. GEORGE  (Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Daphne  DAPHNE  (correcting George) Daphne. GEORGE  Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...  DAPHNE  (interrupts and hurriedly puts down her paper) Oh, I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today.  GEORGE  Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?  DAPHNE  He told me not to get involved with you.  GEORGE  What? DAPHNE  Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps George's hand) hurting me.  GEORGE  He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.  DAPHNE  Is it true? GEORGE  Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.   (ABC Studios)  (All My Children Set) SON  How long are you going to be away for Daddy?  FATHER  I'm not really going away, I told you, I'll be back every other weekend.  SON  Don't go Daddy, don't go. FATHER  Now Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much, but sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.  DIRECTOR  (walks into the scene) ...and there's your scene. Stand-ins  KRAMER  Yo STAGE HAND  All right you guys get on their spots so we can fix the lights.   (Mickey and Kramer walk onto the set and get into positions)  KRAMER  (taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.  MICKEY  (quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy?  KRAMER  (trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.  MICKEY  (tugs on Kramer's coat) Don't go Daddy, don't...go.  KRAMER  Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.   (Kramer and Mickey go to hug and Kramer's pipe hits Mickey in the face)  MICKEY  Ah! (pauses for the hug) all right (Kramer still holding on) all right! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him)  DIRECTOR  Ok everybody that's lunch... one hour.   (The director pauses and looks at Mickey as if something is different)  KRAMER  How do those lifts feel? MICKEY  Quiet. TAMMY  Hi guys. MICKEY  Hey Tammy. TAMMY  Hey, you look different. Have you been working out?  MICKEY  (looks at Kramer) Not that I know of.  TAMMY  Well whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it you look great.  MICKEY  How about lunch? TAMMY  OH I can't today, but um I see it our future. (starts to leave) See ya Kramer.  KRAMER  Ya. TAMMY  Bye Mickey KRAMER  Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)  KRAMER &amp; MICKEY  Ya! MICKEY  All of a sudden. KRAMER  What? JOHNNY  Hey Mick. MICKEY  How you doin' Johnny? JOHNNY  What gives...what's going on? Goin' out with Tammy?  MICKEY  Maybe. What's it to you? JOHNNY  Somethin' different about you. MICKEY  I got my hair cut that's all (turns to look at Kramer)  JOHNNY  Nah, that's not it. Something else... Ya you look different.   (Kramer starts eating a sandwich) MICKEY  You don't, you got the same ugly mug since the day I met ya.  JOHNNY  I don't know what it is, but I'll find out. (walking away) I'll find out.   (Kramer and Mickey look at each other, Mickey makes a pointing motion as if to reference the conversation with Johnny, Kramer shakes his head no.)   (Back to Jerry with Fulton) JERRY  ..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Pachyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really, really, funny.   (Phil Enters) PHIL  Hey Jerry. JERRY  Hey Phil how you doing? PHIL  You look terrific. JERRY  I got my health. PHIL  Well, that's the most important thing. (to Fulton) Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane, Butane, Nitrane! (Fulton looks at him still stone faced and not amused. To Jerry) How's he doing?  JERRY  (wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Jerry and Elaine) ELAINE  You should have told that story about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.   (Buzzer) JERRY  I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?  GEORGE  (on the speaker) Ya JERRY  Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.  ELAINE  Do I know him? JERRY  No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.  ELAINE  If you were a woman would you go out with him?  JERRY  If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.  ELAINE  (laughs) Ya, I bet you would. all right, give him my number.  JERRY  all right.  (George Enters) GEORGE  This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'  JERRY  What? GEORGE  Ya. That's what she told me. ELAINE  Why? GEORGE  Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.  ELAINE  Is she? GEORGE  Of course. ELAINE  So? GEORGE  Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her. ELAINE  Maybe he likes her. GEORGE  Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.  JERRY  So what are you gonna do? GEORGE  Well I can't break up with her now.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  Because he said I was going to. ELAINE  So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?  GEORGE  Yes, I am. JERRY  Ya, I could see that. GEORGE  I don't see any way around it. JERRY  No, me either. GEORGE  What choice do I have? JERRY  None.  (ABC Studio Locker Room)  (Mickey walks in to discover his Locker is open and that his lifts where in there)   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Jerry and Kramer) JERRY  Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.  KRAMER  Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?  JERRY  (yelling) Yes I told him the Pachyderm story!  KRAMER  Maybe I outta go over there. JERRY  Towards what end? KRAMER  I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.   (Knocking on the Door)  (Jerry and Kramer walk over to it, Kramer opens it to reveal Mickey)  KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey Mick. MICKEY  (to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker.  KRAMER  YAOH! MICKEY  (slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows I'm heightening. (to Kramer) This never would have happened if you hadn't pushed me to get those things. I told you.  KRAMER  Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.  MICKEY  Ya well just keep out of my business you big ape. (pushes Kramer)  KRAMER  Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)  MICKEY  You (grabs Kramer)  (Mickey and Kramer begin a struggle) JERRY  (starts pulling them apart) All right break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)  KRAMER  (pacing back and forth) Ya.  JERRY; Behave yourselves. MICKEY  I'm sorry Kramer. KRAMER  No no it's all right, it's all right. You're stressed Oout!  JERRY  (to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?  MICKEY  Oh, he's always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids, Ricky Schroder, Macaulay Culkin.  KRAMER  (whistles) What's he like huh? MICKEY  He's a good kid. KRAMER  Ya? JERRY  So what does he care if you put lifts in?  MICKEY  You don't understand. There's an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid, some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job, lost his friends, Everything. Oh, I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing, but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!?   (George's car outside Daphne's place) DAPHNE  George, tomorrow's Sunday. We could sleep late, and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together, go for a long walk, maybe do a little shopping, have lunch...  GEORGE  (interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.  DAPHNE  Why not? GEORGE  I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.  DAPHNE  I thought we were going to spend the day together.  GEORGE  Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the Velcro ball. (laughs)  DAPHNE  Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know, moving in?  GEORGE  Yes, oh yes very much. DAPHNE  Maybe you don't want to move in. GEORGE  No, no I do. You know it's just...  DAPHNE  (interrupting him) Maybe Al Netchie was right, maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.  GEORGE  (angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! all right I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.   (Elaine and Phil in Phil's car outside Elaine's Apartment) ELAINE  (Phil cracking up) So then Pachyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can barely hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...  PHIL  (dying of laughter) I'm peeing in my pants.  ELAINE  (cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.  PHIL  Oh, I'm sorry, Oh. What a story. ELAINE  I know, I know, I was unbelievable   (laughter dying) PHIL  Oh that is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard.  ELAINE  (wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.  PHIL  Well this has been one hell of a night.  ELAINE  Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.  PHIL  You know, you really are beautiful Elaine.  ELAINE  Oh, well, (pauses) Good night. PHIL  Good night? ELAINE  Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Jerry sitting on a stool on the phone) JERRY  (on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week. It killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.  ELAINE  Hello. JERRY  So? ELAINE  What? JERRY  Come on. How was your date? ELAINE  Oh, the date. The date. JERRY  Ya how was it? ELAINE  Interesting. JERRY  Really. ELAINE  Oh ya. JERRY  Why what happened? ELAINE  Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.  JERRY  Just put it. ELAINE  He took it out. JERRY  (confused) He what? ELAINE  He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.  JERRY  He took what out? ELAINE  It. JERRY  He took It, Out? ELAINE  Yessiree Bob. JERRY  He couldn't. ELAINE  He did. JERRY  (motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...  ELAINE  Noooo. JERRY  You mean he just ELAINE  Yes. JERRY  Are you sure? ELAINE  Oh quite. JERRY  There was no mistaking it? ELAINE  (looks straight into his eyes) Jerry.  JERRY  So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound \"mmm\") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound \"mmm\") then all of sudden...  ELAINE  Yea. JERRY  It. ELAINE  It. JERRY  Out. ELAINE  Out. JERRY  Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?  ELAINE  Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?  ELAINE  (to Kramer) He took it out.  (Shocked, Kramer acts like he just got a cold shiver down his back)  KRAMER  Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.   (Monk's)  (Jerry and George sitting at the booth nearest to the door)  GEORGE  So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.  JERRY  It. GEORGE  It. JERRY  Out. GEORGE  Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) all right, Hey come on, get out of here, Daphne gonna be here any minute.  JERRY  All right I'm going. GEORGE  You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.  JERRY  Well how long you are going to keep this up?  GEORGE  Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.  JERRY  You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.  GEORGE  I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.  JERRY  Yes I do. GEORGE  What are you doing? JERRY  I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.   (Fulton's Hospital Room)  (Phil and Jerry in the hall outside Fulton's Room) PHIL  Ah hey Jer. JERRY  Oh hey Phil. PHIL  You know I'm sorry things didn't work out with Elaine. I don't know what I did wrong.  JERRY  Well, y..you showed her who you are.   (Phil turns to see a woman breast feeding her baby down the hallway)  PHIL  Oh, look at this, what she's got to breast feed in public.  JERRY  Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.  PHIL  I'll see ya. JERRY  Ya take it easy.  (Phil leaves)  (Jerry enters Fulton's Room) JERRY  (acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.   (ABC Studios set) KRAMER &amp; MICKEY  Rock, paper, scissors match. MICKEY  all right, rock beats paper.  (Mickey smacks Kramer on the hand for losing) KRAMER  I thought paper covered rock? MICKEY  Nah, rock flies right through paper.  KRAMER  What beats rock? MICKEY  (looks at his hand) Nothing beats rock.  KRAMER  all right come on. KRAMER &amp; MICKEY  Rock, paper, scissors match. KRAMER  Rock. MICKEY  Rock KRAMER &amp; MICKEY  Rock, paper, scissors match. KRAMER  Rock. MICKEY  Rock.  (Bob walks by) MICKEY  Hey Bob. What's with you? You gotta problem?

MICKEY  Rock.  (Tammy walks up) MICKEY  Hey Tammy. TAMMY  Hello. MICKEY  So Tammy, finally, today's our big lunch.  TAMMY  I don't think so. MICKEY  Why not? What the hell are you talking about?  TAMMY  Look Mickey, everybody knows that you're heightening. It's all over the set.  MICKEY  Wait, wait (goes to grab her arm) TAMMY  (recoils) Don't touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling a stupid stunt like this.  MICKEY  Wait a second, wait a second, you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda' lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! I'm Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Brewster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesn't agree with what he did, he points at Kramer) It's all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesn't know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea.  TAMMY  Come on Johnny, let's go get something to eat.   (all the little people leave including Tammy along with Johnny)  MICKEY  (in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH!  KRAMER  What?  (Mickey runs and tackles Kramer) MICKEY  AH! KRAMER  Mickey!  (Back in Fulton's Hospital Room)  (Jerry is doing material) JERRY  This guy's belching out vitamins..  FULTON  (dying of laughter and coughing) Stop.  JERRY  (cont.) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?  FULTON  (still laughing and coughing) Stop.  JERRY  For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?   (Back at Monk's)  (George and Daphne at the booth nearest to the door) DAPHNE  George, first let me just say I've never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean it's so rare in men these days an, that's what makes this all the more difficult.  GEORGE  (happily) Difficult? DAPHNE  The other day, after work, some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George...  GEORGE  (acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.  DAPHNE  Uh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid the worst of it is it's someone you know. Jerry Persheck.  GEORGE  Pachyderm? DAPHNE  Heh, he was carrying these two pieces of pizza... THE END>",

        "text": "   THE WIFE Written by   Peter Mehlman   (Comedy club)  Of all the places that you go all the time, the dry-cleaning relationship is one of the most bizarre. Because you keep giving each other the same thing, back and forth, over and over again. He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you. It's like it's half his shirt, in a way. He has it as much as you do...you oughta go shopping with him. 'What do you think of this shirt?' 'That would look good with a light starch.' The only warning label people really respect is 'dry-clean only.' Y'know what I mean? Speed limits, lung cancer, cigarette warnings - your very life is at stake! People go, 'Ah, the hell with it!' But dry-clean only? 'Oh, don't put that in the wash! It's dry-clean only! Are you crazy?!'   Opening scene - Jerry and his girlfriend Meryl at Jerry's apartment. Meryl comes out of Jerry's bedroom.  MERYL  Good morning. JERRY  Good morning. MERYL  How'd you sleep? JERRY  Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.  MERYL  I was not! JERRY  C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!  MERYL  By the way, you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'  JERRY  No, no, 12-8! MERYL  No, it's 15-8. JERRY  I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.  MERYL  Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast.  JERRY  Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Haven't worn this one in a long time.  MERYL  Ooh, cashmere? JERRY  No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.  MERYL  Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?  JERRY  No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.  MERYL  Alright, we'll stop over there. JERRY  Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?  MERYL  Pancakes. JERRY  Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.  MERYL  I don't know that!  Mark's Michelle is a dog.  JERRY  But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.  MERYL  I'll get the short stack. JERRY  Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'  KRAMER  We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.  JERRY  Hey, is that my maple syrup? (Kramer hands it over.)  MERYL  You bring your own syrup? KRAMER  Got to. JERRY  You got a lot to learn about pancakes.   Jerry and Meryl at Marty the dry-cleaner's. MARTY  This is my wife. She died eight years ago. I been looking all over for this!  JERRY  Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?  MARTY  Well, see here, the chain is broken...it must have slipped in when I was, uh...(gestures at the racks of clothes behind him.)  JERRY  Oh, wow. MARTY  I turned my house upside-down looking for this! It's all I have left of her.  MERYL  Oh, that's so touching. JERRY  Oh, come on! MARTY  What are you talkin' about? JERRY  It's silly! MARTY  Hey, forget it! JERRY  Get outta here! MARTY  It's done! JERRY  Alright. MERYL  Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.  MARTY  I didn't know you were married. JERRY  Oh...yeah...you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.  MARTY  Sure, you get the discount, too. JERRY  You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...  MERYL  I'm taking him to the cleaners! JERRY  Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!   Elaine on the street outside the New York Health Club. Greg comes out of the club.  ELAINE  Oh, hi Greg. GREG  Haven't seen you in a while. ELAINE  Yeah. Well, today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.  GREG  You ran the Mini-Marathon? ELAINE  No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)  GREG  Well, I gotta take off. ELAINE  Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?  GREG  Eleven-thirty. ELAINE  Eleven-thirty? GREG  Wait, ten-thirty. Sorry. ELAINE  Oh. GREG  Do you have to be somewhere? ELAINE  No. GREG  Then what are you doing? ELAINE  I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.  GREG  Oh. Well, it was good seeing you. ELAINE  Yeah, nice to see you, too.  (Greg plants an open-lipped kiss on Elaine and walks away. She looks after him with a puzzled expression.)   Jerry and Meryl having breakfast at the coffee shop. MERYL  Uh, would you, um...can I... JERRY  Pardon? MERYL  The syrup. Would you pass the syrup?  JERRY  Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)  WAITRESS  Can I get you anything else? JERRY  Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.  WAITRESS  Okay. MERYL  And a check for my husband. JERRY  To my beautiful wife. MERYL  To my adoring husband. JERRY  Adoring? What about handsome? MERYL  I like adoring. JERRY  Sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)  OWNER  Excuse me...where did you get that?  JERRY  I, uh...well... OWNER  Uh, we don't allow any outside syrups, jams or condiments in the restaurant. (To Jerry) And if I catch you in here with that again...I will confiscate it.  JERRY  Well, I told my wife not to bring it.   Jerry and Kramer in Jerry's apartment. JERRY  No, just Meryl. KRAMER  Why, why? Why does she get it? JERRY  Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds, and Jerry lets Elaine into the building - Jerry: Yeh? Elaine: Meh. Jerry: Eh.) And I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying \"my wife.\" Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - \"my wife\" this, \"my wife\" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.  KRAMER  \"My wife has an inner ear infection.\"  JERRY  See? KRAMER  I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?  JERRY  Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!  KRAMER  C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!  JERRY  Alright. (Elaine enters.) KRAMER  Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?  ELAINE  Let's make it fifty. KRAMER  We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)  ELAINE  Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?  JERRY  The fly-boy. ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.  ELAINE  I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.  JERRY  So? ELAINE  So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.  JERRY  Really. ELAINE  Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.  JERRY  Moisture? ELAINE  Yeah. Definite moisture. JERRY  That's an open-lip kiss, alright. ELAINE  Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?  GEORGE  Oh, uh...it's George. ELAINE  Hey, what happened to you? GEORGE  Nothing...little problem. ELAINE  Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.  GEORGE  Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)  ELAINE  I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.  JERRY  I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.  ELAINE  Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and he ignores me.  JERRY  Yeah, so? ELAINE  I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?  GEORGE  Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.  ELAINE  Yeah? What was it? GEORGE  Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...  JERRY  Here we go. GEORGE  Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.  ELAINE  You went...in the shower? GEORGE  Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)  ELAINE  Do you go in the shower? JERRY  No, never. ELAINE  Do you? KRAMER  I take baths. GEORGE  Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?  ELAINE  Ever hear of...holding it in? GEORGE  Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.  ELAINE  How do you know? GEORGE  Medical journals! JERRY  Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?   Jerry dropping off Kramer's quilt at the dry-cleaners. Meryl is already there dropping off some stuff of her own.  JERRY  Hello. MERYL  Oh, hi...honey. JERRY  What are you doing here? MERYL  I just thought I'd drop off a few things.  JERRY  Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)  MARTY  Another quilt? Huh? (Uncle Leo enters.)  UNCLE LEO  Jerry! JERRY  Uncle Leo! UNCLE LEO  Hello! JERRY  Hello. MARTY  So, if you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday, it should be ready.  UNCLE LEO  Your wife? JERRY  Yeah...my wife. UNCLE LEO  What are you talking about? JERRY  Uh...I got married. UNCLE LEO  You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?  JERRY  Well, it was sudden. UNCLE LEO  Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?  JERRY  No, no, it was a small ceremony. UNCLE LEO  Haven't I always been a good uncle?  JERRY  Yes, yes, you have. UNCLE LEO  Who told you when you went to school that you print well?  JERRY  You did, you did. UNCLE LEO  When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.  JERRY  I'm a good printer. UNCLE LEO  I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait! (Jerry tries to catch Leo before he runs off to tell him about his \"pretend marriage,\" but doesn't make it.)   Elaine talking with Greg while he's on a Stairmaster at the health club.  GREG  I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives?  ELAINE  I can find out. GREG  Would ya? ELAINE  Sure. (Thinks - Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal!)  GREG  By the way, you look really great in that leotard.  ELAINE  Oh, thanks. (Thinks - That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.)  GREG  Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night.  ELAINE  (Thinks - Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out.) Um, you know Greg, I...  GREG  Can I have a sip of your water? ELAINE  Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)  GREG  Thanks. (Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the bottle with his shirt first.)  ELAINE  (Thinks - Oh my God.) GREG  I'm sorry, what were you saying? ELAINE  It was nothing, forget it. (George enters the gym.)  GREG  See that guy right there? I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too. (On the other side of the room, George falls off an exercise machine and gets his foot caught in it.)   Jerry and Meryl in Jerry's apartment. Meryl is lounging on the couch, watching TV and eating chocolates.  MERYL  Honey? Could you get me something to drink?  JERRY  You're right there. MERYL  C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)  JERRY  Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?  MERYL  I didn't do anything with it. JERRY  Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.  MERYL  It's in the first drawer. JERRY  I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.  MERYL  Yes, it is. JERRY  Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.  MERYL  Did I say you were stupid? JERRY  Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)  MERYL  Do you want me to go find it? JERRY  Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.   (Cut to Morty and Helen in Florida, each with phone in hand.)  HELEN  Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?  MORTY  Why the hell didn't you tell us? JERRY  Listen, Ma... MERYL  It was in here yesterday! JERRY  Yeah, that's what I said! HELEN  Who is she? When did this happen? MORTY  I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.  HELEN  Morty, you're talking too loud. MORTY  I'm not talking loud! HELEN  You're hurting my eardrum. MERYL  Well, you must have done something with it!  JERRY  I'm on the phone! HELEN  Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?  JERRY  Mom, I'm not married. HELEN  What? JERRY  I'm not married! MORTY  I knew it, I told ya! HELEN  Uncle Leo said. JERRY  I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.  HELEN  A discount on dry-cleaning? JERRY  Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.  MERYL  Well, I give up. JERRY  Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)  KRAMER  Got any coffee? JERRY  Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?  KRAMER  My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!  JERRY  What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)  KRAMER  Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)   Jerry and Meryl in bed later that night. JERRY  Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.  MERYL  Yeah, me too. Love you. JERRY  Love you. MERYL  Well, goodnight. JERRY  Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)   Commercial break.  Jerry, George and Elaine in Jerry's apartment the next day.  GEORGE  They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!  ELAINE  So what do you want me to do? GEORGE  Talk to him! ELAINE  How can I do that? GEORGE  You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!  ELAINE  Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!  GEORGE  Well, that doesn't mean anything! ELAINE  Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!  JERRY  She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.  GEORGE  Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?  JERRY  Bottle-wipe supercedes it. GEORGE  Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?  ELAINE  George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.  GEORGE  Why? ELAINE  I...I don't know... GEORGE  Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!  ELAINE  No, that's not it! GEORGE  Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!  ELAINE  Why couldn't you just wait? GEORGE  I was there! I saw a drain! ELAINE  Since when is a drain a toilet?! GEORGE  It's all pipes! What's the difference?!  ELAINE  Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!  GEORGE  I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)  JERRY  Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?  ELAINE  Okay! Okay! I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)  KRAMER  Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.  JERRY  Alright. KRAMER  Well, you gotta pick it up for me!  JERRY  Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!  KRAMER  I'm so tired! ELAINE  Boy, you don't look good. KRAMER  Huh? I don't? ELAINE  No, you look pale. KRAMER  Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)  JERRY  Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...   Jerry at the dry-cleaners. Kramer paces outside impatiently, waiting for his quilt.  MARTY  I'm sorry, it's not ready yet. (Kramer bursts in.)  KRAMER  Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?  MARTY  Who the hell are you? It's not your quilt.  JERRY  He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.  MARTY  Well, uh...maybe tomorrow. KRAMER  Maybe. JERRY  Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay. KRAMER  Alright, I'm gonna see you later. JERRY  Where you goin'? KRAMER  I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.  JERRY  I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.  KRAMER  Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.  JERRY  I'm goin' home. (Kramer exits. An attractive woman enters the dry-cleaners with a bundle of clothes in her hands. Jerry notices her and waits by the door.)  PAULA  Excuse me? Uh, how much would it cost to clean this?  MARTY  Oh, about thirteen dollars. PAULA  Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that.  MARTY  Well, I'm sorry.  (Paula turns around to leave and runs into Jerry. They smile at each other.)   Elaine and Greg at the health club. A sweaty Greg is exercising on a leg machine.)  ELAINE  Hi, Greg. GREG  Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.)  ELAINE  I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)  GREG  It's all yours. (Walks away. Elaine looks at the machine, then George runs over.)  GEORGE  What happened? Did he bring it up?  ELAINE  Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.  GEORGE  Signal? What signal? ELAINE  Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.  GEORGE  I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!  ELAINE  Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.  GEORGE  A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?  ELAINE  Yeah! It's a social thing. GEORGE  What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!  ELAINE  No! I won't be a party to this. GEORGE  So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?  ELAINE  Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)   Jerry and Paula in a booth at the coffee shop. Jerry is trying to get the bundle of clothes from her so he can pay for the dry-cleaning.  PAULA  I won't let you do this! JERRY  I want to! PAULA  But it isn't right! I can't. JERRY  Give me the clothes. PAULA  Jerry, please. What about her? JERRY  Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)  PAULA  No, Jerry, please! JERRY  I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.  PAULA  I can't fight you. (They embrace and kiss passionately.)  JERRY  Do you want box or hanger? PAULA  You decide. (Jerry considers.)  Kramer in a tanning booth at the health club. He lies down on the tanning bed and bonks his head. Cut back to Elaine and Greg in the weight room.  ELAINE  You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?  GREG  Yeah. (Spies the shapely manager of the health club.) Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here.  ELAINE  Are you sure you want to do that? GREG  Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.  ELAINE  You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)  GREG  Very. ELAINE  Ah. You know, uh...I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)  GREG  Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out.  ELAINE  You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.  GREG  Why? ELAINE  Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?  GREG  Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?  ELAINE  Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.   (Cut back to Kramer lying on the health club tanning bed - fast asleep and snoring.)   Meryl picking up her clothes at the dry-cleaners. MERYL  Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.  MARTY  Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself.  MERYL  Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.)   Anna with her family and friends at her apartment. There's a knock at the door.  ANNA  That's him! (Opens the door. Kramer stands there, deeply tanned and smiling. Anna and her grandfather are shocked.)   Jerry and Meryl in Jerry's apartment. MERYL  You son of a bitch! JERRY  I'm sorry. MERYL  Who is she? I want to know who she is.  JERRY  It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.  MERYL  A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?  JERRY  Yes, that's right. MERYL  What happened to us, Jerry? JERRY  I'll tell you what happened. We got married.  MERYL  I'm sorry, this is my fault. I pushed it on you.  JERRY  No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.  MERYL  Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.  JERRY  It's alright, I want you to have it.  MERYL  Okay, thanks. JERRY  We'll always have...pancakes. MERYL  Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)  Cut back to Kramer at Anna's door. GRANDPA  I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool!   (Kramer stands there, grinning foolishly.) THE END>",

Conversational Distance, don't you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown at a drive-through and Hand shakes is the worst, there's absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people? Too long, too weak, sometimes they give you the three-quarter handshake just the fingers, early release, late release, sometimes people will dispute your release, you let go there're hangin' on. I have actually said to people 'Hey the handshake is over!.' Too many pumps, coming in too high, too sweaty, coming from too far away. Sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip, late release, and pull you in for the too close conversation. To him I say 'That's three strikes you're out.'   (Monk's)  (George and Jerry at the usual booth) JERRY  You know their timing couldn't be worse.  GEORGE  Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?  JERRY  You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.  GEORGE  When are they leaving for Paris? JERRY  Not for another three days. GEORGE  What about her place? JERRY  She lives with her parents. GEORGE  Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.  JERRY  (sarcastically)Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.  GEORGE  Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?  JERRY  The baldies GEORGE  Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.  JERRY  That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.   (Alec and Joey enter) ALEC  (walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.  GEORGE  Hey Alec JERRY  Hey Alec ALEC  This is Joey. GEORGE  Hey Joey, how you doin'? ALEC  (Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?  GEORGE  Well uh.... JOEY  (interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?  GEORGE  Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.  ALEC  That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.  JOEY  Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..  ALEC  (grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya.  JERRY  What happened? GEORGE  What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?  JERRY  (acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?   (Street)  (Jerry and George walking down the sidewalk.) JERRY  Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?  GEORGE  Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.  JERRY  Ya, it's much better isn't it? GEORGE  Oh, n-no comparison. JERRY  Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.  GEORGE  (stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.  JERRY  What? GEORGE  Your parents are going to Paris right?  JERRY  Yea? GEORGE  So I tell Alec that I have to goto Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.  JERRY  What about little Joey? GEORGE  Who? JERRY  Ah, I think he's probably better off.   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Morty and Helen are sitting at Jerry's Table; Jerry and George are standing by them)  GEORGE  I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.  MORTY  But there are no stamps on these. GEORGE  Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.  HELEN  Why are you doing this? JERRY  He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.  HELEN  Why? JERRY  Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?  HELEN  I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)  KRAMER  (putting on the lotion) Ya HELEN  It's from the Sachs Fifth Avenue in Miami.  KRAMER  Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.  JERRY  Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.  KRAMER  Ya MORTY  Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.  KRAMER  Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.  GEORGE  Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?  KRAMER  Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.  GEORGE  What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?  KRAMER  Well I suppose the children do. GEORGE  (pondering) Yes I suppose they do.  KRAMER  (takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.   (Kramer goes to turn the door nob and falls straight to the floor slipping off the nob, then continues to try to open the door with no one really watching; He then uses his coat to get a grip and then smiles and exits)  GEORGE  (grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?   (Morty and Helen look at each other) HELEN  Tonight? GEORGE  Yea they're making Payaya. HELEN  (looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.  JERRY  (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?  HELEN  (turns to Jerry) We have plans. JERRY  Where'd you get plans? HELEN  (annoyed) We have plans. GEORGE  Well um, what about tomorrow night?  HELEN  (turns back toward George) Maybe GEORGE  Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.  MORTY  (to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.  GEORGE  (quietly) Ya. JERRY  (walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.  GEORGE  Ya.  (George tries to open the door hand slips then he exits; Jerry makes sure the door is closed)  JERRY  So what plans do you have? MORTY  None JERRY  So how come you're not going over there for dinner?  HELEN  Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.  MORTY  We can't stand them. JERRY  Really? Since when? HELEN  Since always. We've never liked them.  JERRY  Why? HELEN  Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, you never notice?  JERRY  No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.  MORTY  Well we do.  (Buzzer; Jerry goes over to answer it) JERRY  Ya?  (Elaine and Aaron are heard laughing on the Intercom) ELAINE  It's us. JERRY  U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?  HELEN  We adore Elaine. JERRY  She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.  HELEN  What's he like? JERRY  He's nice, bit of a close talker. HELEN  A what? JERRY  You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'  HELEN  They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.   (Elaine and Aaron enter) EVERYONE  Hi. MORTY  Hello Elaine  (Morty and Helen give Elaine a hug) ELAINE  This is Aaron. HELEN  Hello Aaron MORTY  Hello. AARON  (getting up in Helen's face) So how long you folks in town?  HELEN  Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris.  AARON  Ah MORTY  We're going with a select charter group.  AARON  I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, I'll give 'em to ya.  HELEN  We can't take money. AARON  Oh, no, it's a gift. (looking toward Elaine) from us.  ELAINE  Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?  JERRY  No I haven't. AARON  You know (to Morty) I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour?  HELEN  (grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?  AARON  (up in Helen's face) Easily HELEN  I wouldn't be any trouble? AARON  (gets closer) Of course not. HELEN  When would we go? AARON  How about right now? MORTY  I'm ready HELEN  Are you sure? AARON  Yes. HELEN  Ok, let me get my coat.  (Helen goes to get her coat) AARON  (walking over to Elaine and getting into her face) Elaine what do you say?  ELAINE  W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.  AARON  Oh. (getting into Jerry's face) How about you Jerry?  JERRY  I'm swamped. AARON  You sure? You could examine the art work up close.  JERRY  Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.  ELAINE  (under her breath) Ya that'll happen)  AARON  (Moving toward the door) Alright. We're off.   (Aaron, Helen and Morty heading out the door) MORTY  Ok, bye. HELEN &amp; AARON  Bye. JERRY  Ok buh bye. Have a good time. ELAINE  Bye. AARON  See everybody later (Morty and Helen leave; Aaron closes the door blowing Elaine a kiss)  JERRY  Ok. ELAINE  Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?  JERRY  I don't know. ELAINE  What is that? JERRY  Maybe he was just trying to be nice.  ELAINE  Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?  JERRY  Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.   (Jerry walks over to the couch sits down and picks up the phone)  ELAINE  What? JERRY  (dialing) He got em out of the house.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  Call Rachel. ELAINE  Oh. JERRY  (on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)  ELAINE  (putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.   (Elaine kisses at Jerry; Jerry looks at her in disgust)  (Costanza House) FRANK  They're not coming? GEORGE  No, they had plans. ESTELLE  How could they have plans? GEORGE  That's what I wanna know. FRANK  Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're are dear friends.  ESTELLE  What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?  GEORGE  They said tomorrow, maybe. FRANK  Maybe? ESTELLE  Maybe they don't like us. FRANK  Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?  ESTELLE  Ah keep quiet. FRANK  What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?  GEORGE  I don't know what the reason could be.   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Morty, Helen and Aaron enter) JERRY  (disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi. AARON  Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.  HELEN  Aaron is quite the tour guide. MORTY  Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?  JERRY  Oh sure like Monet. MORTY  Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.  JERRY  Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.  MORTY  I say the guy was painting without his glasses.   (phone rings) JERRY  (answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.  HELEN  Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.  JERRY  Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)  AARON  Well I should be going. HELEN  Oh thanks again. AARON &amp; HELEN  Buh bye.  (Kramer enters) AARON  Oh you must be Kramer (advances on Kramer to close to his face Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground) I've heard about you.  KRAMER  You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.  AARON  (Laughing) Well see you later. KRAMER  Yeah. AARON  (leaving) Bye JERRY  Bye KRAMER  So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?  HELEN  We have no plans. MORTY  (noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's wearing? That's the Executive.  KRAMER  Now what is Executive? JERRY  The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.  MORTY  I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.  HELEN  Why would they? Nobody bought them then.  MORTY  He's wearing one. KRAMER  Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.  MORTY  You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida?  KRAMER  Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.  MORTY  You gotta deal.  (Kramer and Morty shake hands) KRAMER  Yaaaa. JERRY  This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.  MORTY  I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.  HELEN  You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.  MORTY  He'll send them express. HELEN  You're crazy. MORTY  I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.  JERRY  N-na I'm paying for the trip. MORTY  So much the better.  (Monk's)  (George and Alec are sitting at the booth closest to the door)  GEORGE  Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.  ALEC  Paris huh? GEORGE  Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.  ALEC  Where will you stay? GEORGE  An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.  ALEC  George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.  GEORGE  Fantastic? ALEC  Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect solution.  GEORGE  How gee what a coincidence. ALEC  And you'll send me a postcard.  (Elaine's Apartment)  (Elaine and Aaron lying in bed) AARON  Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.  ELAINE  Mm hmm. AARON  And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him  ELAINE  Aaron AARON  Yes? ELAINE  Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?  AARON  Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.  ELAINE  Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?  AARON  No, it was fun. ELAINE  You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.  AARON  Yea, they bought me a coke.  (Jerry's Apartment)  (Morty and Jerry are sitting at his table; Kramer is standing next to Morty; Helen is getting the fold out sofa ready to sleep)  KRAMER  So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?  MORTY  I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.  KRAMER  How serendipitous. MORTY  So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.  KRAMER  Mmm JERRY  He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.  KRAMER  Did you call Jack Klompus yet? MORTY  I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.  JERRY  Ah come on. MORTY  Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)  HELEN  Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?  JERRY  No I haven't seen it yet. HELEN  Oh you have to go you have to JERRY  I'm going HELEN  You have to JERRY  Ok MORTY  (on the phone) Hello Jack.  (Jack in Florida) JACK  Ya MORTY  It's Morty JACK  Who died? MORTY  Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.  JACK  What boxes? MORTY  I'm gonna explain what boxes. JACK  Alright how the hell do I know? MORTY  Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.  JACK  I thought you're going to Paris MORTY  I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.  JACK  What's in the boxes? MORTY  Raincoats. JACK  Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.  HELEN  I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.  JACK  When do you want these? MORTY  Send them tomorrow.  (Costanza House)  (George, Estelle and Frank are sitting at the table for breakfast all still in what they slept in)  ESTELLE  You think they're coming tonight? GEORGE  I dunno they said maybe. FRANK  Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.  ESTELLE  Well they better come, I got all this Paella.  FRANK  I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.  GEORGE  Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.  ESTELLE  Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?  GEORGE  I-I wasn't in the attic. ESTELLE  I heard noise. GEORGE  Maybe it was a mouse. FRANK  (jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!  GEORGE  What? FRANK  I will not tolerate infestation. GEORGE  You haven't even seen one. FRANK  Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.  ESTELLE  All right Frank that's enough.  (Frank sits back down)  (Rudy's Antique Boutique)  (Rudy is checking out the clothes) GEORGE  I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)  RUDY  Uh huh. GEORGE  They will get a good home won't they?  RUDY  Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.  GEORGE  Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really.  RUDY  I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.  GEORGE  Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.  RUDY  Yea I'm in a good mood here. GEORGE  Thank you.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey, George what are you doing here?  GEORGE  Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.  KRAMER  Oh, I gotcha (clicks) GEORGE  (leaving) That'll do. KRAMER  Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.  GEORGE  Hey that's swell. KRAMER  Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.  GEORGE  Dinner? (grabs Kramer) KRAMER  Ya. GEORGE  You had dinner with the Seinfelds?  KRAMER  Yea, last night. GEORGE  Was this something you had planned for a while?  KRAMER  No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.  GEORGE  (hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!  KRAMER  Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)  RUDY  Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars.  KRAMER  Oh I'll take these. RUDY  All right KRAMER  Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?  RUDY  Sure that's the Executive. KRAMER  Ya, you have any others? RUDY  I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.  KRAMER  Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?  RUDY  Very interested KRAMER  Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.  RUDY  Well bring 'em in. KRAMER  So you'll buy them? RUDY  I don't see what would possibly stop me.   (Out of one of the boxes George sold Rudy flies a couple of moths as the scene ends)   (Jerry's Apartment)  (George enters) GEORGE  Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!  JERRY  What are you talking about? GEORGE  Mom and Pop Seinfeld JERRY  Look I don't know. GEORGE  All right I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.  JERRY  Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.  GEORGE  So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?  JERRY  That's right. GEORGE  Is there something wrong with my parents?  JERRY  Absolutely GEORGE  Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.  JERRY  These the people you currently live with?  GEORGE  Yes. JERRY  Uh huh GEORGE  So are they coming tonight or not?  JERRY  Look I really don't know what they're plans are.  GEORGE  Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.  JERRY  What is that anyway? GEORGE  It's a Spanish dish. It's a mélange of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.  JERRY  I-I'll tell 'em GEORGE  Hey could you do one other thing for me?  JERRY  Name it. GEORGE  You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smiles) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)  JERRY  So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?  GEORGE  (pause) All right if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.   (Elaine's Office)  (Elaine at her desk; Joanna standing near the door) JOANNE  So where's he taking you? ELAINE  Well first we're going to a matinee, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see \"My Fair Lady\" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.  JOANNE  You are one lucky girl. (Elaine laughs in happiness) Wish I could find a nice guy. (Joanne goes to leave; Aaron enters) Hi Aaron.  AARON  (getting up in Aaron's face) Hey Joanne. (turns to Elaine and goes over to her) Hey  ELAINE  (already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi   (Elaine and Aaron kiss)  (Enter Helen) HELEN  Hello, Hello.  (Enter Morty) MORTY  Hello Elaine  (Morty gives Elaine a kiss; Elaine is in shock) AARON  I was able to finagle two more tickets to \"My Fair Lady\" and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen.  ELAINE  Oh, Great. MORTY  (looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?  HELEN  You don't mind to you Elaine? ELAINE  Mind? Oh o-of course not. AARON  We can make a whole day of it. MORTY  This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?  ELAINE  (somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld   (Collection of Scenes with the music and singing from \"My Fair Lady\" over them. First the matinée where we see (from left to right) Helen, Morty, Elaine and Aaron. Morty opens a candy bar takes a bite then offers it to Elaine then Aaron who takes it as the scene changes to the Cafe 123. At the restaurant we see (from left to right) Morty, Elaine, Helen and Aaron. Morty is pointing at a painting while talking to Elaine then takes off his glasses. Next George is seen getting ready to hop into a cab when Morty, Elaine, Aaron and Helen ride by in a horse drawn carriage (Handsome Cab) drinking champagne. George then smacks the top of the cab in disgust) (song from \"My Fair Lady\") \"I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night, and still have begged for more. I could have spread my wings, and done a thousand things, I've never done before. I never know what made it so exciting, but all at once my heart would fly\"   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Jerry and Rachel making out on Jerry's couch) JERRY  (stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.  RACHEL  When are they leaving? JERRY  In two days. RACHEL  It's been soo long. JERRY  I know. RACHEL  Ok, it's only two more days.  (They both run their hands through their hair) JERRY  Right, Thursday three o'clock. MORTY  (from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have  HELEN  Ooh. JERRY  Oh Hi. HELEN  We didn't know you had company. JERRY  (tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.  RACHEL  Hi. HELEN &amp; MORTY  Hello Rachel. HELEN  Uh we'll come back another time. JERRY  What other time? HELEN  Whenever JERRY  Where you goin'? MORTY  Uh we'll drive around for a while.  JERRY  You don't have a car. MORTY  We'll take a bus. JERRY  Come on stop. HELEN  No we don't mind MORTY  I'll get a book. RACHEL  No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.  HELEN  O-oh are you sure? RACHEL  Yea. HELEN  Cuz we don't wann.. JERRY  (interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?  RACHEL  Definitely JERRY  Ok.Uh RACHEL  (going out the door) It's night meeting you.  HELEN  Nice meeting you. JERRY  Ok, see you later. MORTY  Boy that was some show. JERRY  What show? MORTY  \"My Fair Lady\" JERRY  When did you get tickets to see that?  HELEN  Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.  JERRY  Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.  MORTY  We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.  JERRY  Oh. HELEN  He looks better on TV. JERRY  Oh  (Phone rings) JERRY  (answering phone) Hello?  (Jack Klompus in Florida) JACK  Hello Jerry, JERRY  Yea. JACK  It's Jack Klompus. JERRY  Oh hi Jack. JACK  So when are you coming down to Florida again?  JERRY  As soon as is humanly possible. JACK  You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.  JERRY  Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it. JACK  So uh where's your father? JERRY  Ya he's right here.  (Jerry hands Morty the phone) MORTY  Yea JACK  Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.  MORTY  What do you mean? JACK  There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work  MORTY  You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.   (Doris enters the scene with Jack) DORIS  Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes.  MORTY  You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.  JACK  Get the hell outta here with your knob.  DORIS  What does he want from you? MORTY  My idiot son could open that garage door.  JERRY  What did I do? MORTY  Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.   (Jack is seen hanging up his phone) MORTY  They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.  HELEN  Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.  JERRY  (in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.  HELEN  How are you gonna get all this done in time?  MORTY  Don't worry about it. JERRY  (in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?   (Costanza House)  (George, Estelle and Frank all standing in the kitchen) GEORGE  They were drinking champagne in a buggy!  FRANK  First Kramer, then Elaine? GEORGE  Yea FRANK  It's a slap in the face. ESTELLE  (with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!  FRANK  What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.   (Frank leaves the kitchen and moves into the living room) ESTELLE  The hell with them. GEORGE  (in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.   (George and Estelle move their way into the living room) FRANK  Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)  GEORGE  (sitting down) Vacation? FRANK  You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.   (Estelle is already sitting next to George on the couch) GEORGE  (claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)  FRANK  But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.  GEORGE  The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.  FRANK  How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)  GEORGE  (picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.  FRANK  (looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.   (Ally outside Rudy's)  (Rudy has a gasoline bottle and is burning some clothes) RUDY  Lousy moth ridden crap.  (Median Monologue)  I-I-I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, you know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' Oh it's clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't wear iron underwear and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear vapor. W-we don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just go (blows on the mic) and it's gone that it is jus.  Schindler's List)  (Schindler's List is playing as Jerry and Rachel are making out. Newman is then seen disgusted by this display)   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Jerry Enters; Morty and Helen are sitting at the table with a map out)  JERRY  Hey. MORTY  Hey, Jerry. HELEN  So how was the movie? JERRY  Oh, really good, really good. HELEN  And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)  JERRY  Like that (snaps his fingers) MORTY  What about the end, with the list?  JERRY  Ya that was some list. HELEN  What did you think about the black and white?  JERRY  (confused) The black and white. MORTY  The whole movie was in black and white.  JERRY  Oh yea, I didn't even realize. MORTY  You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.  JERRY  Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.   (Rudy's Antique Boutique) KRAMER  So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle  RUDY  Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.   KRAMER; Ya hey I'm on your side.  (George enters) KRAMER  Hey what again? GEORGE  I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.  KRAMER  Payaya, ya I'll be there. GEORGE  Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.  KRAMER  No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.  GEORGE  Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.  KRAMER  Yap I know. GEORGE  You're doing all the leg work. KRAMER  That's right GEORGE  He's ripping you off KRAMER  You're right he's ripping me off GEORGE  If anybody should be getting more it's you.  KRAMER  He's ripping me off GEORGE  Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.  KRAMER  YAH! (exits) RUDY  (coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Morty coming out of the bathroom) MORTY  You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?  HELEN  Well he told you about the place. MORTY  So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?  HELEN  You find something you get a fee. MORTY  Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.  HELEN  Well it's too late now. MORTY  Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.  HELEN  Well you're not gonna say anything.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  I've been thinking about something.  MORTY  Ya so have I KRAMER  Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.  MORTY  You don't think it's fair. KRAMER  No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.  MORTY  What leg work? KRAMER  Oh, there's leg work. MORTY  If anything you're getting too much.  KRAMER  Too much?! MORTY  That's right, they're my coats. KRAMER  Look I want thirty-five percent. MORTY  I'm thinking more like fifteen. KRAMER  No way I'm taking fifteen. MORTY  Well you're not getting thirty-five.  KRAMER  Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.  MORTY  Ok it's a deal  (They shack hands.)  (Rudy's Antique Boutique) RUDY  Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.  GEORGE  I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.  RUDY  (counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.  GEORGE  So uh where are the clothes? RUDY  I burned 'em. GEORGE  Oh. That's good.  (Monk's)  (Jerry and Elaine sitting in the booth) ELAINE  N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?  JERRY  It is a tad askew. ELAINE  I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?  JERRY  I've hardly been out to dinner with them.  ELAINE  See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.  JERRY  You're right he's insane. ELAINE  Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.  JERRY  So what are you going to do? ELAINE  I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?  JERRY  Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.  ELAINE  Ya what do you mean from what you saw?  JERRY  Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.  ELAINE  Yea why not? JERRY  I was kind of um (pauses) making out.  ELAINE  (thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?  JERRY  I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.  ELAINE  During Schindler's List? JERRY  (trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.  ELAINE  Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?  JERRY  No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.  ELAINE  Oh.  (Jerry's Apartment)  (A knock at the door prior to the reveal of Jerry's apartment; Morty is sitting at the table Helen closes the refrigerator to answer the door; Newman is revealed in his full Newman)  NEWMAN  Hello Mrs. Seinfeld HELEN  (like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)  NEWMAN  Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)  HELEN  Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.  NEWMAN  Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.  HELEN  Wondering what? NEWMAN  Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.  HELEN  Well we already saw it. NEWMAN  Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.  MORTY  (getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?  NEWMAN  Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.  HELEN  I'm afraid I don't. NEWMAN  Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.  MORTY  What? NEWMAN  What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.  HELEN  Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?  NEWMAN  Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.  HELEN  Jerry sends his laundry out. NEWMAN  (laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)   (Helen closes the door and looks at Morty in disgust)  (Jerry's Apartment-Later that day)  (Jerry enters; Morty is sitting on the couch writing, Helen is in the bathroom)  JERRY  Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?  HELEN  How could you? JERRY  How could I what? HELEN  You were making out during Schindler's List?  JERRY  What? No. MORTY  Don't lie Jerry. JERRY  (turns) Newman. HELEN  How could you do such a thing? JERRY  I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.   (Morty and Helen both sigh and turn to go back to what they were doing; Phone rings)  JERRY  (answering the phone) Hello.  (Jack in Florida with a bandage on his right hand) JACK  Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus. JERRY  Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.  MORTY  Hello JACK  Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.  MORTY  You didn't get in? JACK  Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.  MORTY  You broke the window? HELEN  He broke the window? JACK  You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?  DORIS  (off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.  MORTY  Did you send them? JACK  Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.  MORTY  Tomorrow afternoon? HELEN  Tomorrow afternoon? JERRY  Tomorrow afternoon? MORTY  I told you to send them express. JACK  W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.  MORTY  So what did you do about the window?  JACK  I gotta fix your window now? MORTY  All right all right. Goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.  JERRY  W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?  HELEN  We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.  MORTY  Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.   (Jerry annoyed walks toward his room) HELEN  Some place else? What about Paris?  MORTY  You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.  HELEN  I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.  MORTY  You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.  HELEN  I think you're out of your mind.  (Costanza House) FRANK  I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.  GEORGE  Moths? FRANK  Moths, ate three boxes? GEORGE  Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.  ESTELLE  You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.   (Estelle goes to answer the door) KRAMER  (from outside) Hello? ESTELLE  Hello KRAMER  (still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)  ESTELLE  Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)  KRAMER  Ooo Paella GEORGE  Hey uh let me take you're coat. KRAMER  (giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.  FRANK  That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?  KRAMER  Wha? FRANK  That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back  KRAMER  (trying to get away) woah GEORGE  Dad?! KRAMER  (laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.  GEORGE  Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.  FRANK  Who's Rudy? What clothes? GEORGE  I sold your clothes yesterday. FRANK  You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?  GEORGE  I didn't think you wore them anymore.  FRANK  It's cruise wear! ESTELLE  Kramer, I love that shirt. KRAMER  Yaya FRANK  THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!! ESTELLE  You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.  KRAMER  Oh, well, thank you.  (Estelle giggles) FRANK  Who's this Rudy? KRAMER  Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.  FRANK  Mory Seinfeld? He's a bum. KRAMER  Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.  GEORGE  Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?  KRAMER  Yea. GEORGE  What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?  KRAMER  Well I suppose they are wasted. GEORGE  Yes I suppose they are. FRANK  Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.  KRAMER  A mouse!  (Frank starts making noises; Kramer and Frank both run to the other room where they get stuff in between the door and wall; Frank hits Kramer to get him in then closes the door)   (Monk's)  (Jerry and George enter) JERRY  You want the tickets? GEORGE  Yes. JERRY  You're gonna take this kid to Paris?  GEORGE  Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.  JERRY  You know I'm paying for these tickets.  GEORGE  It's alright, I got lunch.  (Airport)  (Kramer, Morty and Jerry standing at a luggage carousel) KRAMER  Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Payaya was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?  MORTY  Not really. KRAMER  Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm  JERRY  Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?  MORTY  This is it. KRAMER  So how much are we gonna make? MORTY  Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.  KRAMER  Wha two thousand? Three thousand? MORTY  That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.  KRAMER  More? More than three thousand? MORTY  Just watch me do my thing. JERRY  Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?  MORTY  Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.  WOMAN  Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.  JERRY  (turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?   (George and Joey enter the scene getting in line for the Charter Flight)  GEORGE  Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.  JOEY  Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris.   (Joey walks by George to board the plane and puts his Gum on the wall.)   (Rudy's Antique Boutique) FRANK  You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.  RUDY  Who are you anyways? FRANK  I'm the father. RUDY  He said his father was dead. FRANK  He said I was dead? RUDY  That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.  FRANK  That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.   (Kramer and Morty enter with a bunch of raincoats) KRAMER  Hey, Frank! FRANK  Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.  MORTY  Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.  FRANK  I'm retracting that it was ever offered.  MORTY  I retract your retraction. FRANK  Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?  MORTY  Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.  RUDY  You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.  KRAMER  I thought we had a deal? FRANK  That's another one of my shirts!! RUDY  I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.  MORTY  Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.  RUDY  Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?  FRANK  My clothes don't have moths! MORTY  Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?  RUDY  That's right. KRAMER  (laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)   (Airport)  (Morty and Helen with a couple bags; Jerry, Elaine and Aaron saying good-bye)  ANNOUNCEMENT  Flight-433 now boarding for Miami, Gate 18a. Flight-433 now boarding.  MORTY  Ok, let's go. HELEN  (to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.  AARON  Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?  ELAINE &amp; JERRY  NO. MORTY  Ah, good-bye.  (Jerry hugs Morty; Helen and Elaine give each other a kiss)  ELAINE  Good-bye JERRY  Take care MORTY  Alright Jer.  (Morty and Elaine hug; Jerry and Helen give each other a kiss)  ELAINE  Nice to see.. MORTY  Buh bye Elaine JERRY  Buh bye. HELEN  Buh bye.  (Aaron torn by emotion moves in and gives Morty and Helen a hug a hug)  HELEN  (looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.  AARON  Thank you. JERRY  I think she meant me, but. MORTY  Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.  JERRY  Ok.  (Morty and Helen go to board the plane) ELAINE  Bye. JERRY  Bye.  (Aaron begins to follow them) ELAINE  Aaron? Aaron are you ok? AARON  I could've done more. I could've done so much more.  ELAINE  You did enough. AARON  (turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.  JERRY  You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.  AARON  (holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent)  ELAINE  Why? AARON  (to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!   (Jerry and Elaine continue to look at him funny)  (Rachel's Parents' Place)  (Jerry knocks on the door; Mr. Goldstein answers) JERRY  Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home? MR. GOLDSTEIN  I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter.  JERRY  Why what did I do? MR. GOLDSTEIN  (Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)  JERRY  Rachel! MR. GOLDSTEIN  (closing the door on Jerry) Good night!  JERRY  Rachel!  (Monk's)  (Jerry and Elaine at the normal booth) JERRY  So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.  ELAINE  Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?  JERRY  The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.  ELAINE  Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.  JERRY  Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.  ELAINE  (sighs) So how about that Aaron? JERRY  Whew ELAINE  You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?  JERRY  No I hadn't noticed.  (Newman enters and walks by the table; Jerry doesn't notice him as he is getting something out of his coat pocket)  NEWMAN  (at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.  JERRY  (hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.  NEWMAN  (moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.  JERRY  Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.  NEWMAN  Ohh, were you there? JERRY  Yes I was. NEWMAN  (looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.  JERRY  Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?  NEWMAN  (couple quick breaths) Shocking. JERRY  Yes, well that was nothing.  (Newman makes a noise and takes off toward the door as Jerry gets up)  NEWMAN  (running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!   (Jerry chases Newman right out the door)  (Paris)  (George is sitting at an outside eatery in France with Joey)  GEORGE  Where the hell is your father?!  (George smiles and waves at a girl sitting at another table; Joey puts some stuff on George's glasses)   (Cruise ship out in the Ocean)  (Estelle and Frank walking around on the boat) ESTELLE  This is the best thing we ever did.  FRANK  I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.  ESTELLE  Ah forget about them let's just...   (Frank and Estelle run into Morty and Helen)  (Comedy club)  Personal distance is a very important thing. There's a new personal distance, ATM distance. When someone's using an ATM, you wanna be about six feet back don't you? Because people a little edgy around that ATM don't they? They got their money out, their eyes are darting all around. The other place I wanna be about six feet away is Urinals, you want some distance there too. ATMs and Urinals, I guess whenever someone's taking valuable out of their pants you want to give them as much room as possible.     THE END>",

MORTY  I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.  KRAMER  How serendipitous. MORTY  So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.  KRAMER  Mmm JERRY  He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.  KRAMER  Did you call Jack Klompus yet? MORTY  I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.  JERRY  Ah come on. MORTY  Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)  HELEN  Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?  JERRY  No I haven't seen it yet. HELEN  Oh you have to go you have to JERRY  I'm going HELEN  You have to JERRY  Ok MORTY  (on the phone) Hello Jack.  (Jack in Florida) JACK  Ya MORTY  It's Morty JACK  Who died? MORTY  Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes.  JACK  What boxes? MORTY  I'm gonna explain what boxes. JACK  Alright how the hell do I know? MORTY  Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me.  JACK  I thought you're going to Paris MORTY  I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.  JACK  What's in the boxes? MORTY  Raincoats. JACK  Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? That's garbage.  HELEN  I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.  JACK  When do you want these? MORTY  Send them tomorrow.  (Costanza House)  (George, Estelle and Frank are sitting at the table for breakfast all still in what they slept in)  ESTELLE  You think they're coming tonight? GEORGE  I dunno they said maybe. FRANK  Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't come tonight they might not see us.  ESTELLE  Well they better come, I got all this Paella.  FRANK  I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.  GEORGE  Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.  ESTELLE  Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?  GEORGE  I-I wasn't in the attic. ESTELLE  I heard noise. GEORGE  Maybe it was a mouse. FRANK  (jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving!  GEORGE  What? FRANK  I will not tolerate infestation. GEORGE  You haven't even seen one. FRANK  Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.  ESTELLE  All right Frank that's enough.  (Frank sits back down)  (Rudy's Antique Boutique)  (Rudy is checking out the clothes) GEORGE  I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)  RUDY  Uh huh. GEORGE  They will get a good home won't they?  RUDY  Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.  GEORGE  Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a Casanova really.  RUDY  I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.  GEORGE  Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.  RUDY  Yea I'm in a good mood here. GEORGE  Thank you.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey, George what are you doing here?  GEORGE  Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.  KRAMER  Oh, I gotcha (clicks) GEORGE  (leaving) That'll do. KRAMER  Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together, selling raincoats.  GEORGE  Hey that's swell. KRAMER  Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.  GEORGE  Dinner? (grabs Kramer) KRAMER  Ya. GEORGE  You had dinner with the Seinfelds?  KRAMER  Yea, last night. GEORGE  Was this something you had planned for a while?  KRAMER  No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.  GEORGE  (hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!  KRAMER  Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)  RUDY  Well they just came in, part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars.  KRAMER  Oh I'll take these. RUDY  All right KRAMER  Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?  RUDY  Sure that's the Executive. KRAMER  Ya, you have any others? RUDY  I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.  KRAMER  Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?  RUDY  Very interested KRAMER  Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.  RUDY  Well bring 'em in. KRAMER  So you'll buy them? RUDY  I don't see what would possibly stop me.   (Out of one of the boxes George sold Rudy flies a couple of moths as the scene ends)   (Jerry's Apartment)  (George enters) GEORGE  Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!  JERRY  What are you talking about? GEORGE  Mom and Pop Seinfeld JERRY  Look I don't know. GEORGE  All right I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.  JERRY  Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.  GEORGE  So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?  JERRY  That's right. GEORGE  Is there something wrong with my parents?  JERRY  Absolutely GEORGE  Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.  JERRY  These the people you currently live with?  GEORGE  Yes. JERRY  Uh huh GEORGE  So are they coming tonight or not?  JERRY  Look I really don't know what they're plans are.  GEORGE  Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.  JERRY  What is that anyway? GEORGE  It's a Spanish dish. It's a mélange of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.  JERRY  I-I'll tell 'em GEORGE  Hey could you do one other thing for me?  JERRY  Name it. GEORGE  You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smiles) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)  JERRY  So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?  GEORGE  (pause) All right if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.   (Elaine's Office)  (Elaine at her desk; Joanna standing near the door) JOANNE  So where's he taking you? ELAINE  Well first we're going to a matinee, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see \"My Fair Lady\" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.  JOANNE  You are one lucky girl. (Elaine laughs in happiness) Wish I could find a nice guy. (Joanne goes to leave; Aaron enters) Hi Aaron.  AARON  (getting up in Aaron's face) Hey Joanne. (turns to Elaine and goes over to her) Hey  ELAINE  (already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi   (Elaine and Aaron kiss)  (Enter Helen) HELEN  Hello, Hello.  (Enter Morty) MORTY  Hello Elaine  (Morty gives Elaine a kiss; Elaine is in shock) AARON  I was able to finagle two more tickets to \"My Fair Lady\" and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen.  ELAINE  Oh, Great. MORTY  (looking around) This is some office. What's the square footage?  HELEN  You don't mind to you Elaine? ELAINE  Mind? Oh o-of course not. AARON  We can make a whole day of it. MORTY  This is some building, Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You don't get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli?  ELAINE  (somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld   (Collection of Scenes with the music and singing from \"My Fair Lady\" over them. First the matinée where we see (from left to right) Helen, Morty, Elaine and Aaron. Morty opens a candy bar takes a bite then offers it to Elaine then Aaron who takes it as the scene changes to the Cafe 123. At the restaurant we see (from left to right) Morty, Elaine, Helen and Aaron. Morty is pointing at a painting while talking to Elaine then takes off his glasses. Next George is seen getting ready to hop into a cab when Morty, Elaine, Aaron and Helen ride by in a horse drawn carriage (Handsome Cab) drinking champagne. George then smacks the top of the cab in disgust) (song from \"My Fair Lady\") \"I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night, and still have begged for more. I could have spread my wings, and done a thousand things, I've never done before. I never know what made it so exciting, but all at once my heart would fly\"   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Jerry and Rachel making out on Jerry's couch) JERRY  (stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.  RACHEL  When are they leaving? JERRY  In two days. RACHEL  It's been soo long. JERRY  I know. RACHEL  Ok, it's only two more days.  (They both run their hands through their hair) JERRY  Right, Thursday three o'clock. MORTY  (from outside the door; singing) I could have danced all night (entering with Helen) I could have danced all night and still have  HELEN  Ooh. JERRY  Oh Hi. HELEN  We didn't know you had company. JERRY  (tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.  RACHEL  Hi. HELEN &amp; MORTY  Hello Rachel. HELEN  Uh we'll come back another time. JERRY  What other time? HELEN  Whenever JERRY  Where you goin'? MORTY  Uh we'll drive around for a while.  JERRY  You don't have a car. MORTY  We'll take a bus. JERRY  Come on stop. HELEN  No we don't mind MORTY  I'll get a book. RACHEL  No no it's ok, I was just leaving anyway.  HELEN  O-oh are you sure? RACHEL  Yea. HELEN  Cuz we don't wann.. JERRY  (interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?  RACHEL  Definitely JERRY  Ok.Uh RACHEL  (going out the door) It's night meeting you.  HELEN  Nice meeting you. JERRY  Ok, see you later. MORTY  Boy that was some show. JERRY  What show? MORTY  \"My Fair Lady\" JERRY  When did you get tickets to see that?  HELEN  Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.  JERRY  Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.  MORTY  We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine.  JERRY  Oh. HELEN  He looks better on TV. JERRY  Oh  (Phone rings) JERRY  (answering phone) Hello?  (Jack Klompus in Florida) JACK  Hello Jerry, JERRY  Yea. JACK  It's Jack Klompus. JERRY  Oh hi Jack. JACK  So when are you coming down to Florida again?  JERRY  As soon as is humanly possible. JACK  You know I still got that pen, the one that writes upside down.  JERRY  Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it. JACK  So uh where's your father? JERRY  Ya he's right here.  (Jerry hands Morty the phone) MORTY  Yea JACK  Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.  MORTY  What do you mean? JACK  There is something wrong with the key. The key doesn't work  MORTY  You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes.   (Doris enters the scene with Jack) DORIS  Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes.  MORTY  You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it.  JACK  Get the hell outta here with your knob.  DORIS  What does he want from you? MORTY  My idiot son could open that garage door.  JERRY  What did I do? MORTY  Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it.   (Jack is seen hanging up his phone) MORTY  They'll be here first thing Thursday morning.  HELEN  Thursday morning? You know we're leaving at three o'clock.  JERRY  (in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.  HELEN  How are you gonna get all this done in time?  MORTY  Don't worry about it. JERRY  (in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?   (Costanza House)  (George, Estelle and Frank all standing in the kitchen) GEORGE  They were drinking champagne in a buggy!  FRANK  First Kramer, then Elaine? GEORGE  Yea FRANK  It's a slap in the face. ESTELLE  (with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!  FRANK  What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like that.   (Frank leaves the kitchen and moves into the living room) ESTELLE  The hell with them. GEORGE  (in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.   (George and Estelle move their way into the living room) FRANK  Let's forget about it. We're going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair)  GEORGE  (sitting down) Vacation? FRANK  You're mother and I are planning on taking a cruise.   (Estelle is already sitting next to George on the couch) GEORGE  (claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)  FRANK  But I can't find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic.  GEORGE  The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.  FRANK  How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door)  GEORGE  (picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.  FRANK  (looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes.   (Ally outside Rudy's)  (Rudy has a gasoline bottle and is burning some clothes) RUDY  Lousy moth ridden crap.  (Median Monologue)  I-I-I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, you know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' Oh it's clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't wear iron underwear and that's what it's gonna take to get me in those clothes. I mean I'll move into an apartment after a strange person moves out, why would I wanna move into somebody's pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but it's not because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. It actually becomes underwear vapor. W-we don't even throw it out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. That's how men throw out underwear we just go (blows on the mic) and it's gone that it is jus.  Schindler's List)  (Schindler's List is playing as Jerry and Rachel are making out. Newman is then seen disgusted by this display)   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Jerry Enters; Morty and Helen are sitting at the table with a map out)  JERRY  Hey. MORTY  Hey, Jerry. HELEN  So how was the movie? JERRY  Oh, really good, really good. HELEN  And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)  JERRY  Like that (snaps his fingers) MORTY  What about the end, with the list?  JERRY  Ya that was some list. HELEN  What did you think about the black and white?  JERRY  (confused) The black and white. MORTY  The whole movie was in black and white.  JERRY  Oh yea, I didn't even realize. MORTY  You don't even think about it, there's so much going on.  JERRY  Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.   (Rudy's Antique Boutique) KRAMER  So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle  RUDY  Look, I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in.   KRAMER; Ya hey I'm on your side.  (George enters) KRAMER  Hey what again? GEORGE  I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.  KRAMER  Payaya, ya I'll be there. GEORGE  Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.  KRAMER  No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.  GEORGE  Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.  KRAMER  Yap I know. GEORGE  You're doing all the leg work. KRAMER  That's right GEORGE  He's ripping you off KRAMER  You're right he's ripping me off GEORGE  If anybody should be getting more it's you.  KRAMER  He's ripping me off GEORGE  Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.  KRAMER  YAH! (exits) RUDY  (coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh it's you? You're the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap.   (Jerry's Apartment)  (Morty coming out of the bathroom) MORTY  You know I've been thinking, why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent?  HELEN  Well he told you about the place. MORTY  So what, why is that worth twenty-five percent? It's a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is?  HELEN  You find something you get a fee. MORTY  Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.  HELEN  Well it's too late now. MORTY  Those are my coats. I saved them, I stored them, I've been waiting years for this pay off.  HELEN  Well you're not gonna say anything.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  I've been thinking about something.  MORTY  Ya so have I KRAMER  Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.  MORTY  You don't think it's fair. KRAMER  No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.  MORTY  What leg work? KRAMER  Oh, there's leg work. MORTY  If anything you're getting too much.  KRAMER  Too much?! MORTY  That's right, they're my coats. KRAMER  Look I want thirty-five percent. MORTY  I'm thinking more like fifteen. KRAMER  No way I'm taking fifteen. MORTY  Well you're not getting thirty-five.  KRAMER  Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five percent.  MORTY  Ok it's a deal  (They shack hands.)  (Rudy's Antique Boutique) RUDY  Moths are a discourage to my business, all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and they're everywhere.  GEORGE  I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.  RUDY  (counting the money to make sure it's all there) It's already put a dent in my fumigation bill.  GEORGE  So uh where are the clothes? RUDY  I burned 'em. GEORGE  Oh. That's good.  (Monk's)  (Jerry and Elaine sitting in the booth) ELAINE  N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?  JERRY  It is a tad askew. ELAINE  I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?  JERRY  I've hardly been out to dinner with them.  ELAINE  See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but nobody is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.  JERRY  You're right he's insane. ELAINE  Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.  JERRY  So what are you going to do? ELAINE  I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?  JERRY  Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.  ELAINE  Ya what do you mean from what you saw?  JERRY  Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.  ELAINE  Yea why not? JERRY  I was kind of um (pauses) making out.  ELAINE  (thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?  JERRY  I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.  ELAINE  During Schindler's List? JERRY  (trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.  ELAINE  Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?  JERRY  No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.  ELAINE  Oh.  (Jerry's Apartment)  (A knock at the door prior to the reveal of Jerry's apartment; Morty is sitting at the table Helen closes the refrigerator to answer the door; Newman is revealed in his full Newman)  NEWMAN  Hello Mrs. Seinfeld HELEN  (like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)  NEWMAN  Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over, grabs a junior mint, smells it then puts it in his pocket)  HELEN  Wonderful, we went to the theater last night.  NEWMAN  Oh the theater. Because I was wondering.  HELEN  Wondering what? NEWMAN  Why I didn't see you at Schindler's List with Jerry.  HELEN  Well we already saw it. NEWMAN  Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry that you didn't go.  MORTY  (getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that?  NEWMAN  Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.  HELEN  I'm afraid I don't. NEWMAN  Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.  MORTY  What? NEWMAN  What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.  HELEN  Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?  NEWMAN  Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent.  HELEN  Jerry sends his laundry out. NEWMAN  (laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing)   (Helen closes the door and looks at Morty in disgust)  (Jerry's Apartment-Later that day)  (Jerry enters; Morty is sitting on the couch writing, Helen is in the bathroom)  JERRY  Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?  HELEN  How could you? JERRY  How could I what? HELEN  You were making out during Schindler's List?  JERRY  What? No. MORTY  Don't lie Jerry. JERRY  (turns) Newman. HELEN  How could you do such a thing? JERRY  I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.   (Morty and Helen both sigh and turn to go back to what they were doing; Phone rings)  JERRY  (answering the phone) Hello.  (Jack in Florida with a bandage on his right hand) JACK  Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus. JERRY  Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.  MORTY  Hello JACK  Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't work. It's no good.  MORTY  You didn't get in? JACK  Oh I got in, I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in.  MORTY  You broke the window? HELEN  He broke the window? JACK  You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?  DORIS  (off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.  MORTY  Did you send them? JACK  Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, two o'clock.  MORTY  Tomorrow afternoon? HELEN  Tomorrow afternoon? JERRY  Tomorrow afternoon? MORTY  I told you to send them express. JACK  W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning, I figured what the hell's the difference.  MORTY  So what did you do about the window?  JACK  I gotta fix your window now? MORTY  All right all right. Goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the phone) I don't think we are gonna make that flight.  JERRY  W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?  HELEN  We have to make the flight, we're with a charter group. If we don't the trip is off.  MORTY  Well what's the difference we'll go some place else.   (Jerry annoyed walks toward his room) HELEN  Some place else? What about Paris?  MORTY  You don't understand, I've come this far, I can't stop now.  HELEN  I can't believe that you're doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats.  MORTY  You don't understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back.  HELEN  I think you're out of your mind.  (Costanza House) FRANK  I just don't understand how all those clothes can disappear.  GEORGE  Moths? FRANK  Moths, ate three boxes? GEORGE  Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.  ESTELLE  You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.   (Estelle goes to answer the door) KRAMER  (from outside) Hello? ESTELLE  Hello KRAMER  (still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)  ESTELLE  Hope you're hungry. (goes into the kitchen)  KRAMER  Ooo Paella GEORGE  Hey uh let me take you're coat. KRAMER  (giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy.  FRANK  That shirt, where'd you get that shirt?  KRAMER  Wha? FRANK  That's my cabana shirt, you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back  KRAMER  (trying to get away) woah GEORGE  Dad?! KRAMER  (laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.  GEORGE  Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.  FRANK  Who's Rudy? What clothes? GEORGE  I sold your clothes yesterday. FRANK  You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes?  GEORGE  I didn't think you wore them anymore.  FRANK  It's cruise wear! ESTELLE  Kramer, I love that shirt. KRAMER  Yaya FRANK  THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S MINE!! ESTELLE  You look just like Frank, on our honeymoon.  KRAMER  Oh, well, thank you.  (Estelle giggles) FRANK  Who's this Rudy? KRAMER  Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.  FRANK  Mory Seinfeld? He's a bum. KRAMER  Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.  GEORGE  Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?  KRAMER  Yea. GEORGE  What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?  KRAMER  Well I suppose they are wasted. GEORGE  Yes I suppose they are. FRANK  Tomorrow I'm going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes.  KRAMER  A mouse!  (Frank starts making noises; Kramer and Frank both run to the other room where they get stuff in between the door and wall; Frank hits Kramer to get him in then closes the door)   (Monk's)  (Jerry and George enter) JERRY  You want the tickets? GEORGE  Yes. JERRY  You're gonna take this kid to Paris?  GEORGE  Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.  JERRY  You know I'm paying for these tickets.  GEORGE  It's alright, I got lunch.  (Airport)  (Kramer, Morty and Jerry standing at a luggage carousel) KRAMER  Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Payaya was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?  MORTY  Not really. KRAMER  Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm  JERRY  Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?  MORTY  This is it. KRAMER  So how much are we gonna make? MORTY  Take it easy, I've been through a million of these negotiations.  KRAMER  Wha two thousand? Three thousand? MORTY  That's giving it away. This is a one of a kind item.  KRAMER  More? More than three thousand? MORTY  Just watch me do my thing. JERRY  Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?  MORTY  Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didn't tape it, he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple.  WOMAN  Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.  JERRY  (turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?   (George and Joey enter the scene getting in line for the Charter Flight)  GEORGE  Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.  JOEY  Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's no way you're staying with us in Paris.   (Joey walks by George to board the plane and puts his Gum on the wall.)   (Rudy's Antique Boutique) FRANK  You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn.  RUDY  Who are you anyways? FRANK  I'm the father. RUDY  He said his father was dead. FRANK  He said I was dead? RUDY  That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me.  FRANK  That's what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars.   (Kramer and Morty enter with a bunch of raincoats) KRAMER  Hey, Frank! FRANK  Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting our dinner invitation.  MORTY  Well you don't have to retract it because we never went.  FRANK  I'm retracting that it was ever offered.  MORTY  I retract your retraction. FRANK  Oh, you trying to unload some of that junk of yours?  MORTY  Would you excuse me please, we're conducting business here.  RUDY  You can keep your raincoats. I'm not interested.  KRAMER  I thought we had a deal? FRANK  That's another one of my shirts!! RUDY  I'm not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street.  MORTY  Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat business for thirty-five years.  RUDY  Ya how do I know there aren't moths like his stuff?  FRANK  My clothes don't have moths! MORTY  Because of his moths you're not buying my raincoats?  RUDY  That's right. KRAMER  (laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)   (Airport)  (Morty and Helen with a couple bags; Jerry, Elaine and Aaron saying good-bye)  ANNOUNCEMENT  Flight-433 now boarding for Miami, Gate 18a. Flight-433 now boarding.  MORTY  Ok, let's go. HELEN  (to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.  AARON  Are you sure you can't stay a little longer?  ELAINE &amp; JERRY  NO. MORTY  Ah, good-bye.  (Jerry hugs Morty; Helen and Elaine give each other a kiss)  ELAINE  Good-bye JERRY  Take care MORTY  Alright Jer.  (Morty and Elaine hug; Jerry and Helen give each other a kiss)  ELAINE  Nice to see.. MORTY  Buh bye Elaine JERRY  Buh bye. HELEN  Buh bye.  (Aaron torn by emotion moves in and gives Morty and Helen a hug a hug)  HELEN  (looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.  AARON  Thank you. JERRY  I think she meant me, but. MORTY  Make sure Kramer uses good tape when he sends back the raincoats.  JERRY  Ok.  (Morty and Helen go to board the plane) ELAINE  Bye. JERRY  Bye.  (Aaron begins to follow them) ELAINE  Aaron? Aaron are you ok? AARON  I could've done more. I could've done so much more.  ELAINE  You did enough. AARON  (turning toward her) No, I could've called the travel agency, got them on another flight to Paris, I coulda got them out.  JERRY  You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.  AARON  (holds his arm up) This watch, this watch could've paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring, this ring is one more dinner I could've taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like he's crazy) Water, they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent)  ELAINE  Why? AARON  (to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please!   (Jerry and Elaine continue to look at him funny)  (Rachel's Parents' Place)  (Jerry knocks on the door; Mr. Goldstein answers) JERRY  Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home? MR. GOLDSTEIN  I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be able to see you tonight, or any other night for that matter.  JERRY  Why what did I do? MR. GOLDSTEIN  (Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') Now if you don't mind. (starts to close the door)  JERRY  Rachel! MR. GOLDSTEIN  (closing the door on Jerry) Good night!  JERRY  Rachel!  (Monk's)  (Jerry and Elaine at the normal booth) JERRY  So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.  ELAINE  Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?  JERRY  The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.  ELAINE  Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.  JERRY  Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.  ELAINE  (sighs) So how about that Aaron? JERRY  Whew ELAINE  You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?  JERRY  No I hadn't noticed.  (Newman enters and walks by the table; Jerry doesn't notice him as he is getting something out of his coat pocket)  NEWMAN  (at the counter) Pair of bear claws please.  JERRY  (hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.  NEWMAN  (moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry.  JERRY  Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.  NEWMAN  Ohh, were you there? JERRY  Yes I was. NEWMAN  (looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful film.  JERRY  Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?  NEWMAN  (couple quick breaths) Shocking. JERRY  Yes, well that was nothing.  (Newman makes a noise and takes off toward the door as Jerry gets up)  NEWMAN  (running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!   (Jerry chases Newman right out the door)  (Paris)  (George is sitting at an outside eatery in France with Joey)  GEORGE  Where the hell is your father?!  (George smiles and waves at a girl sitting at another table; Joey puts some stuff on George's glasses)   (Cruise ship out in the Ocean)  (Estelle and Frank walking around on the boat) ESTELLE  This is the best thing we ever did.  FRANK  I just hope those exterminators know what they're doing.  ESTELLE  Ah forget about them let's just...   (Frank and Estelle run into Morty and Helen)  (Comedy club)  Personal distance is a very important thing. There's a new personal distance, ATM distance. When someone's using an ATM, you wanna be about six feet back don't you? Because people a little edgy around that ATM don't they? They got their money out, their eyes are darting all around. The other place I wanna be about six feet away is Urinals, you want some distance there too. ATMs and Urinals, I guess whenever someone's taking valuable out of their pants you want to give them as much room as possible.     THE END>",

        "text": "   THE FIRE Written by  Larry Charles   (Comedy club) JERRY  To me, the thing about birthday parties is that the first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have are actually quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're the least excited person at the party. You don't even really realize that there is a party. You don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties, people have to kinda help you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you don't even know why you're doing it. What is this ritual? What is going on? It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to gather your friends together for you. Sometimes they're not even your friends. They make the judgement. They bring 'em in, they sit 'em down, and they tell you - 'these are your friends! Tell them thank you for coming to my birthday party.'   Elaine, Kramer, and Kramer's excitable girlfriend Toby in Elaine's office at Pendant. They're looking at proofs for Kramer's \"coffee table book about coffee tables.\"  TOBY  These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?  ELAINE  Yeah, really great. TOBY  A coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?  KRAMER  It was there! TOBY  Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)  ELAINE  Actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...  KRAMER  Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?  TOBY  Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!   Elaine and Jerry in Jerry's apartment later that day. ELAINE  'And that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from \"The Price Is Right\"! (demonstrates)  JERRY  Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) \"Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest.\"  ELAINE  Yeah, it's funny, I dunno. JERRY  You don't know? Come on, that's gold!  ELAINE  Well, I don't know about \"gold.\" JERRY  Oh, that's gold, baby. ELAINE  'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?  JERRY  I was saying 'baby' way before George!  ELAINE  Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me.  JERRY  Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.  ELAINE  Yeah, who's he? JERRY  He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly. I would like to have a good show.   (Kramer enters.) KRAMER  Danke schoen, my little dumplings.  ELAINE  Hi. KRAMER  Hey, how about that Toby, huh? ELAINE  Yeah, how about her? KRAMER  Ooh, she's a package full of energy!  ELAINE  Yeah, she's a package full of something.  KRAMER  And that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!  ELAINE  Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)  KRAMER  Hey, are you performing tomorrow night?  JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Great, I'm gonna bring Toby. JERRY  Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.  KRAMER  Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?  ELAINE  Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!  JERRY  Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.  KRAMER  Is that the waitress from the comedy club?  JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?  KRAMER  She's got a kid? JERRY  Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!   George and Robin in a booth at the coffee shop. Robin's kid is under the table.  GEORGE  Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!  ROBIN  Do you think 25 kids is too much? GEORGE  25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets.  ROBIN  So, what about entertainment? (to kid) Should I get Barney?  KID  No Barney! ROBIN  Maybe a clown. GEORGE  How about Bozo? KID  Who's Bozo? GEORGE  Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.  ROBIN  George... GEORGE  With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...  ROBIN  George... GEORGE  And the TV show! He had cartoons! ROBIN  George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.  GEORGE  You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...  FRANK  Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!  ESTELLE  Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!  ROBIN  Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.  GEORGE  Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)   Elaine in her office at work. Toby enters. TOBY  Hi! ELAINE  Hi, Toby. TOBY  How are you doing today? ELAINE  Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?  TOBY  Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?  ELAINE  Nope. TOBY  He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.  ELAINE  Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?  TOBY  No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.  ELAINE  Really! TOBY  Maybe it'll be you! ELAINE  Oh...well... TOBY  You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...  ELAINE  Well! Well, it could be you. TOBY  No... ELAINE  No, really. TOBY  Really? You think so? ELAINE  Sure. TOBY  Boy, wouldn't that be exciting! ELAINE  I mean, stranger things have happened...  TOBY  Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.  ELAINE  Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.  TOBY  Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.)   Jerry and Ronnie the Prop Comic backstage at the comedy club.  JERRY  Hey, Ronnie. (To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?  RONNIE  Yeah. You? JERRY  Yeah. RONNIE  You know Leonard Christian's here?  JERRY  Yeah, I know. RONNIE  Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?  JERRY  I don't...think so. RONNIE  Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?  JERRY  I don't...I dunno. RONNIE  Is it possible for nostrils to expand?  JERRY  Oh, is this a bit? RONNIE  Hey, I don't do \"bits.\" I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun.   (Kramer and Toby enter.) KRAMER  Hey, Jerry. Toby, this is Jerry. TOBY  This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before!  JERRY  Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.  TOBY  You are so funny! JERRY  Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.  TOBY  Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)  KRAMER  What about me? TOBY  What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.  JERRY  Good, good. KRAMER  So, you up next? JERRY  Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?  TOBY  Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)  KRAMER  Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?  JERRY  Yeah. TOBY  Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!  JERRY  O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)  TOBY  Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!   Cut to Jerry on stage. Toby and Kramer are sitting in the audience near the front.  JERRY  Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...  TOBY  Oh, really! Really! That is so true!  JERRY  Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.  TOBY  Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.)  JERRY  See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...  TOBY  Oh, that is so true, yes! JERRY  ...that's why men hunt and women nest.  TOBY  BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.)   Jerry pacing the floor backstage after his act. Kramer enters.  JERRY  Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!  KRAMER  Look, she didn't mean anything. JERRY  Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!  KRAMER  She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!   (Toby enters.) JERRY  Hey! What is wrong with you?! TOBY  Me? Nothing's wrong with me. JERRY  You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!  TOBY  Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.  JERRY  No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!  TOBY  Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?  JERRY  Oh, I can take it. TOBY  Let's go. (Ronnie walks by Jerry.)  RONNIE  Hey, man. Good set.  George talking to Eric, the clown at Robin's son's birthday party.  GEORGE  Bozo? ERIC  No. GEORGE  B-O-Z-O? ERIC  Sorry, I... GEORGE  You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?  ERIC  No! GEORGE  How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?  ERIC  I don't know, I just don't. GEORGE  How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?  ERIC  Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?  GEORGE  Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?  ERIC  Well, what is he? GEORGE  Yes, he's a clown! ERIC  Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!  GEORGE  Alright, just forget it. ERIC  Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!  GEORGE  Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?  ROBIN'S MOTHER  Excuse me...you must be George! I'm Robin's mother. Oh, you seem like such a lovely young man!  GEORGE  Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)  ROBIN  Hi Mom, how's everything? ROBIN'S MOTHER  Oh, this is just a wonderful party!  ROBIN  The burgers should be ready in a minute.  GEORGE  Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!   (The kids all scream and the party goes crazy. George barrels out of the kitchen, pushing down kids, clowns and old ladies in a mad panic to escape. He runs out the door and leaves everyone behind.)   Cut to George sitting in the back of an ambulance with an oxygen mask on his face.  GEORGE  It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)  ERIC  There he is! That's him! (Tries to clobber George with his big shoe.)  ROBIN'S MOTHER  That's the coward that left us to die!   Commercial break.  Cut back to George attempting to explain his cowardly actions to Robin, her mother, Eric and a fireman from the back of the ambulance at the party.  GEORGE  I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.  ROBIN  But you yelled \"get out of my way\"!  GEORGE  Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?  ROBIN  But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!  GEORGE  Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?  FIREMAN  How do you live with yourself? GEORGE  Its not easy.  George and Jerry at the coffee shop. GEORGE  So she doesn't want to see me anymore.  JERRY  Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?  GEORGE  No, her too. And her mother. JERRY  Really? Her mother. GEORGE  Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.  JERRY  You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.  GEORGE  Yeah. But it was somebody's arm. JERRY  So you feel \"women and children first,\" in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.  GEORGE  To some degree. JERRY  So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.  GEORGE  In a manner of speaking. JERRY  Well, it's honest. GEORGE  Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.  JERRY  Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.  GEORGE  Perhaps. JERRY  So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?  GEORGE  Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.  JERRY  By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)  GEORGE  What's that? JERRY  It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.  GEORGE  Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) \"Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.\"  JERRY  I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.  GEORGE  You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.  JERRY  Yeah, right. GEORGE  You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'  JERRY  Yeah, that'd be something. GEORGE  I'm not kidding, you should do it.  JERRY  But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.  GEORGE  Well, go ahead! Do it! JERRY  Why can't I? GEORGE  No reason! JERRY  You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!  GEORGE  This is unprecedented! JERRY  There's no precedent, baby! GEORGE  What...are you using my babies now?   Toby in her office at Pendant. Jerry pokes his head in the door.  JERRY  Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'  TOBY  You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!  JERRY  Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?  TOBY  Well, how would you like it if I called security?  JERRY  Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!   (Kramer arrives just as Toby gets upset and storms out.) KRAMER  Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!   (Street outside. We hear screeching tires and Toby screaming, \"My pinky toe!\" Kramer is heard yelling \"Toby!\" and is shown with a shocked expression on his face.)   Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment. KRAMER  What did you go up there to heckle her for?  JERRY  Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)  KRAMER  Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.  JERRY  Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.  GEORGE  What accident? KRAMER  Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.  GEORGE  That's unbelievable! KRAMER  Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.  GEORGE  You ran? KRAMER  No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, \"I got a toe here, buddy - step on it.\"  GEORGE  Holy cow! KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, \"Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?\" I said, \"Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - \" (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!  GEORGE  How could you do that?! KRAMER  Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.  GEORGE  You're Batman. KRAMER  Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop.  JERRY  You kept makin' all the stops? KRAMER  Well, people kept ringin' the bell!  GEORGE  Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?  KRAMER  Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.  GEORGE  You did all this...for a pinky toe?  KRAMER  Well, it's a valuable appendage.  Elaine in her office at work, talking with two co-workers. JOANNE  So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it.  ELAINE  Really. JOANNE  Poor kid. What an ordeal. MICHAEL  And you know how extremely sensitive she is...she's gonna need our full support.  ELAINE  Yeah, right. MICHAEL  Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?  TOBY  Oh no, I'll be fine...  (A horde of employees flood into Elaine's office to gush over Toby. Elaine is pushed to the floor as a result.)   Elaine and Jerry in Jerry's apartment. JERRY  She got the promotion? ELAINE  Yep. JERRY  Why? ELAINE  I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.  JERRY  Too bad. ELAINE  Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?  JERRY  Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'  ELAINE  Why don't you just shut the f- KRAMER  Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!  ELAINE  Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??  KRAMER  Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.  ELAINE  Oh, wonderful! KRAMER  You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.  ELAINE  Oh, of course! She's deranged.  Jerry and Ronnie backstage at the comedy club. JERRY  So, I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.  RONNIE  I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?  JERRY  Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!  RONNIE  How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it.  JERRY  Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.  RONNIE  Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me.  JERRY  Yeah, well, won't be long. ANNOUNCER  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!  JERRY  Gotta go. (heads out on stage)  (George enters and sees Robin working.) GEORGE  Robin? Robin! ROBIN  George, what is it? I'm working. GEORGE  Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.  ROBIN  What are you talking about? GEORGE  O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)  JERRY  I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need \"the clown\" in his title, as clown? Bozo, \"the\" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...   Cut back to George explaining his situation to Robin. GEORGE  ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.  ROBIN  Listen...I gotta think about this. (walks away.)  GEORGE  Alright, but I'm serious about this.  RONNIE  Alright, hand it over man!  Cut back to Jerry onstage. JERRY  ...that's why men hunt and women nest.  GEORGE  He's got a gun! He's got a gun! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)   Cut back to George in the bar. ROBIN  George! This is Ronnie Kaye! GEORGE  The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?  RONNIE  Nostrils.  (Jerry comes backstage.) JERRY  George - could I have a word?  (Comedy club) JERRY  I was in a hotel the other day, and on the back of the door in the hotel they have the fire map. I'm flattered that they think I have it together enough to stand in a burning hotel room memorizing directions. 'Yeah, I'll go left by the stairs, right by the candy machine...' I'd probably get lost, have to go back to the room, check the map again...and they always tell you, no matter what, whatever you do in a hotel fire - do not panic. Hey, I got four minutes to live, I've never panicked in my whole life - it's my option. Even if they find you, you have a perfect excuse...'Gee, I heard they saved you swingin' from the shower curtain naked with an ice bucket on your head. What happened there?' 'Well, I panicked.' 'That's understandable.'   THE END>",

They'll fight the traffic and the heat and the parking and the hot sand.   Trying to get through the waves, and the ironic thing is the ocean doesn't   even want us in there. That's what surfing is. Surfing is the ocean   throwing us out of itself, you see? We keep trying to paddle in, the   ocean's saying, \"No you don't.\" The ocean is like a nightclub and the   waves are bouncers tossin' us out. The undertow's like a really mean   bouncer. Instead of throwin' you out, they take you in back and rough you   up a little bit. \"Oh, you wanna come in? How 'bout comin' in like 25   miles?\"  back seat. KRAMER  All right, get off at the next exit.  JERRY  Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the exit.  KRAMER  It's a great house, pool's something? Yeah, I'll be there.  JERRY  (To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?  ELAINE  We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in   the Hamptons out of it. JERRY  Didn't they just have a baby? ELAINE  That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the   Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!' JERRY  Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit   them? KRAMER  Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?  JERRY  No. KRAMER  Put that on the top of your list. JERRY  No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane   should be almost there by now. ELAINE  Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but   they're spending the weekend together? JERRY  I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a   letter of intent. ELAINE  When's Rachel comin' out? JERRY  She's makin' the three o'clock train.  ELAINE  Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you   see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.  JERRY  I bought him some kishka. KRAMER  What's that? JERRY  It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In   case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.  GEORGE  I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.  JANE  Me too. I love cough medicine. GEORGE  You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's   amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and   throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I   want. JANE  What's your favorite? GEORGE  Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?  JANE  No. GEORGE  Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a   private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no   trespassing sign will be gone. JANE  Are we almost there? GEORGE  Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a   vegetable stand. JANE  What for? GEORGE  My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.  JANE  Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.  KRAMER  Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.  JERRY  Who are you, Mrs. Robinson? KRAMER  Come on, I'll rub some on yours. JERRY  No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.  GEORGE  (To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and   fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool. JANE  (No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.  GEORGE  Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go   for a ride? JANE  I don't think so. GEORGE  'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?  JERRY  No thanks. KRAMER  No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)  JANE  I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters   with a shady hat on) JERRY  And then there's Mog. (She sits down next to Jerry)  ELAINE  Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?  JERRY  No lines. ELAINE  You know why? One word: shade. JERRY  So when're we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?  ELAINE  I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.  KRAMER  I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you   wanna come? ELAINE  (Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.  JERRY  (Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  Jane's topless. (They all look) KRAMER  Yo yo ma. JERRY  Boutros Boutros-Ghali. ELAINE  Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)  CAROL  Come on, you guys. You can come on and see the bay-bee!  JERRY  Oh, in a minute, Carol. KRAMER  We're gonna be right there. JERRY  This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.  ELAINE  Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?  KRAMER  Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.  ELAINE  What? KRAMER  You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.  JERRY  Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane   enters) JANE  I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink? JERRY  No thanks. ELAINE  I'm good. KRAMER  Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin'   to the beach.  not far behind. CAROL  Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.  ELAINE  Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.  CAROL  Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened   and turn away) ELAINE  Ugghh. CAROL  Is she gorgeous? (Elaine + Jerry looking away)  ELAINE  Oh, gorgeous, yes. JERRY  So very gorgeous. CAROL  Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.   then seeing a rope leading to something he doesn't know of yet.   room. JERRY  Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?  ELAINE  Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.  JERRY  Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit)   And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna   tell them. ELAINE  Oh, you have to lie. JERRY  It's a must lie situation. ELAINE  Yes, it's a must lie situation. JERRY  You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.  ELAINE  No, I don't think so. JERRY  You know, we might want to tell Kramer.  BEN  Oh this ointment should do it. CAROL  How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine!   (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa. ELAINE  Hi. CAROL  Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?  ELAINE  (Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous. BEN  Elaine, you have children? ELAINE  Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to   have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby. BEN  A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite   breathtaking. ELAINE  Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking? CAROL  And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?  BEN  Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and   quickly looks away from the baby) JERRY  Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.  ELAINE  Yeah, see ya. JERRY  Okay. (He leaves) CAROL  Oh, just look at him! BEN  Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his   comment) RACHEL  Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong   way. JERRY  Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes   outside) GEORGE  Hey Rachel! RACHEL  (Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.   (She leaves) GEORGE  What kind of a greeting was that? JERRY  She's got greeting problems. GEORGE  Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like   apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never took on as a hand fruit.  JERRY  Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup   and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of   lobster) KRAMER  Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!  GEORGE  Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)  JERRY  You got lobster for everybody? KRAMER  Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.  GEORGE  This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for   dinner... KRAMER  I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that   'damn' expression behind George) GEORGE  You saw who, what? KRAMER  Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.  JERRY  (Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.  GEORGE  You saw Jane topless? JERRY  Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.  GEORGE  Oh you mean face down on her chest.  JERRY  No. GEORGE  Face up on her back? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Well why'd she do that? KRAMER  I guess she was hot. GEORGE  You mean she just laid there topless?  KRAMER  No, no, she got up, walked around...  GEORGE  Walked around? And you looked? KRAMER  Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go   upstairs, I'll be right back. GEORGE  I can't believe it, you saw her before me.  JERRY  Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)  GEORGE  Well, how good a look did you get?  JERRY  Well what'd you mean? GEORGE  Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police   sketch artist... JERRY  They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.  GEORGE  Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her   naked. JERRY  I guess that's true... GEORGE  Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like   this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit. JERRY  What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?  GEORGE  Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.  JERRY  You can see me naked. I can offer you that.  GEORGE  It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and   you jump out first. ELAINE  Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.  JERRY  I've never been called breathtaking either.  ELAINE  I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not   breathtaking? JERRY  Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.  ELAINE  Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.  JERRY  How are you gonna do that? ELAINE  I can be very clever. RACHEL  I'm gonna take a swim. ELAINE  Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees   George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed. GEORGE  Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room   and goes in) RACHEL  Hey! GEORGE  Oh, sorry. RACHEL  Don't you knock? GEORGE  I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never   seen before. JERRY  You might have. GEORGE  I didn't. JERRY  You won't. RACHEL  What'd you want anyway, George? JERRY  Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you   want? GEORGE  No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.  JERRY  Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.  GEORGE  Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.  RACHEL  We don't have any gum. GEORGE  Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)  RACHEL  Strange man. JERRY  Wait'll you get to know him. RACHEL  So where is this baby, anyway? JERRY  Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so   objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks   down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)  RACHEL  (She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's   room. I'm really sorry. (She exits) GEORGE  I was in the pool! I was in the pool!  GEORGE  Did she do it on purpose? JERRY  It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.  GEORGE  I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.  JERRY  So what? GEORGE  Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...  JERRY  But... GEORGE  Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was   cold... JERRY  Oh... You mean... shrinkage. GEORGE  Yes. Significant shrinkage! JERRY  So you feel you were short changed.  GEORGE  Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete   misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me. JERRY  Well, so what's the difference? GEORGE  What if she discusses it with Jane?  JERRY  Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane. GEORGE  How do you know? JERRY  Women aren't like us. GEORGE  They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about   everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?  JERRY  No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think   women know about shrinkage. GEORGE  How do women know about shrinkage? (They see Elaine walking down   the hall) Elaine! Get! (She enters) Do women know about shrinkage?  ELAINE  What do you mean, like laundry? GEORGE  No. JERRY  Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...  ELAINE  It shrinks? JERRY  Like a frightened turtle! ELAINE  Why does it shrink? GEORGE  It just does. ELAINE  I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.  MICHAEL  Thanks for the lobster, Kramer. KRAMER  Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?  RACHEL  Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.  KRAMER  You mean you've never tasted lobster?  RACHEL  No. KRAMER  Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you   die, you're gonna get some special attention. CAROL  Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.  ELAINE + JERRY  No! JERRY  No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.  ELAINE  Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here.   We're not fun for a baby. JERRY  Yeah, the lobster'll scare him. CAROL  I'm gonna get him. GEORGE  See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much   bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks   things. ELAINE  Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's   ear, which prompts Jane to laugh) GEORGE  What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you   laughing at? JANE  It's nothing, George. GEORGE  You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking   about me? JANE  What is it with you? JERRY  (To George) Easy big fella. MICHAEL  So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the   Fleesher's Market? KRAMER  No, I got 'em in the ocean. MICHAEL  The ocean? What'd you mean? KRAMER  Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these   lobsters came up. MICHAEL  Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those   lobsters from there. That's against the law. KRAMER  Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for   everyone. MICHAEL  My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at   four and came home every night stinking of brine. He sent me through law   school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)  CAROL  (Entering with baby) Here he is. KRAMER  Ahhh! (Falls to floor as he sees the baby)  ELAINE  Some night, huh? BEN  Yeah, I wish I had my telescope. ELAINE  Some dinner, huh? BEN  Nothing like fresh caught lobster.  ELAINE  Some house, huh? BEN  It was built by Mark Farman. ELAINE  Some ugly baby, huh? BEN  What did you say? ELAINE  I said, uh, some snuggly baby. BEN  He is something. ELAINE  Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear   you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you   also used it referring to me. BEN  Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be   nice. (Elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to   her or to the baby) JERRY  You told her? RACHEL  Yeah, what's the big deal? JERRY  You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.  RACHEL  Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed   with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.  GEORGE  You're going back to New York now?  JANE  Yeah, I have some things to do. GEORGE  Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel,   that's what I think. JANE  So what if I did? GEORGE  And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?  JANE  I don't know what you're talking about.  GEORGE  *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all   that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and   *more*! JANE  I'm sure it is. GEORGE  Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.   fridge and Kramer lights up a cigar. KRAMER  Looking for this? (Holding up lobster)  RACHEL  Oh, Kramer! You startled me. KRAMER  Well, I thought you might wind up around here.  RACHEL  Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was   enjoying the lobster so much. I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?  KRAMER  I'm afraid I couldn't do that. RACHEL  Why not? KRAMER  Well, that wouldn't be kosher. RACHEL  C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.  KRAMER  Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.  RACHEL  Come on, Kramer. KRAMER  Heyahhh! RACHEL  I just heard a car drive out. What was that?  JERRY  Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the   night. (Rachel shocked) CAROL  George, thanks so much for making breakfast.  ELAINE  George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.  KRAMER  I didn't know you could cook. GEORGE  Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.  BEN  Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (Rachel   and Jerry enter) RACHEL  Good morning. ALL  Hey, hey. RACHEL  Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really   saved me. MICHAEL  What happened? RACHEL  Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.  KRAMER  You'd regret it for the rest of your life.  RACHEL  You're right, I would have. JERRY  (Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.  GEORGE  A little breakfast. JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  (To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?  RACHEL  Yes, I do, thanks. JERRY  Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like   this? RACHEL  Umm... This is so good. GEORGE  Ah, enjoying them? RACHEL  Mm-hmm. GEORGE  Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of   these. (Holds up lobster bib) RACHEL  There's lobster in these eggs? GEORGE  Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.   (Rachel storms out of room) JERRY  Well, I guess I gotta go, too. ELAINE  Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman   knocks on door, Michael answers) MICHAEL  Excuse me? POLICE  I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster   poacher that cleaned out on of the traps. KRAMER  Wonder what's goin' on. GEORGE  Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.  MICHAEL  There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer   waves to policeman) RACHEL  Ahh! Don't you ever knock? GEORGE  I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael to town.  ELAINE  Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same   car with you either. JERRY  I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.  ELAINE  How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?  JERRY  They got some sort of program.  officer. Back to the car. GEORGE  Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.  JERRY  Hey, isn't that Michael's car? ELAINE  There's Rachel. GEORGE  Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)  THE END>",

I mean, they open it up, blow their nose in it, and then put it back   in their pockets with their other valuables. Wallet, keys, mucous, yup, I've got   everything. Is it because men can't give birth that they're just proud of anything   that comes out of us? We actually have a monogram sewn on to them. What is the   source of pride here? We actually have it sticking out of the breast pocket of our   jacket. \"I have a snot rag.\"  We see a sad-looking George staring out at the ocean. Then cut to the office of Mr.Lippman, where Elaine and Mr. Lippman are toasting in champagne.  MR. LIPPMAN  To your promotion. ELAINE  Oh, thank you! ( They drink ) Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you   how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.  MR LIPPMAN  Well, you're really on your way now.   Elaine screams with joy and Mr. Lippman coughs violently. ELAINE  You really oughtta do something about that cold.   (Monk's) JERRY  You got a raise? ELAINE  I don't fool around, baby! JERRY  I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.  ELAINE  They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.  JERRY  Oh, when did that happen? ELAINE  They're signing the papers next week.  JERRY  Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?  ELAINE  Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.  JERRY  Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.  ELAINE  Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.  JERRY  Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen \"Girlie\" Brown would be very proud of you.   Enter George JERRY  Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?  GEORGE  I went to the beach. ( J and E exchange looks )  JERRY  Oh, the beach. GEORGE  It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working.  JERRY  What is it that isn't working? GEORGE  Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically speaking, but ... I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party. It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong.   ( A waitress comes up to G ) WAITRESS  Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.  GEORGE  Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted ... and a cup of tea.  ELAINE  Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.  JERRY  You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cos salmon swim against the current, and the tuna swim with it.  GEORGE  Good for the tuna.  ( A blonde looks at George ) ELAINE  Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.  GEORGE  So what? What am I supposed to do?  ELAINE  Go talk to her. GEORGE  Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.  JERRY  Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.  GEORGE  Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.  JERRY  If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.  GEORGE  Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do   something!  ( He goes over to the woman ) GEORGE  Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.  VICTORIA  Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.   ( G takes a deep breath ) GEORGE  My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.  VICTORIA  I'm Victoria. Hi.  Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone. JERRY  Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye.   ( Enter Kramer ) KRAMER  Hey. Buddy, it's all happening! JERRY  What's happening? KRAMER  The coffee table book. It's a go! JERRY  Oh yeah, I heard all about it. KRAMER  You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop: Regis and Kathy Lee.  JERRY  You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?  KRAMER  Oh, you better believe it! JERRY  I'll loan you my puffy shirt. KRAMER  No,no,no. JERRY  What're you gonna talk about? KRAMER  Well, coffee tables.  ( The phone rings ) JERRY  Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye.   ( Turns to K ) JERRY  You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.  KRAMER  You know who you are? Even Steven  Cut to G's car; G and Victoria driving VICTORIA  Are you growing a beard? GEORGE  Why shave every day? It just grows right back.  VICTORIA  I guess ... GEORGE  I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.   ( A car cuts in in front of them, G has to make a sudden maneuver )  VICTORIA  Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!  GEORGE  Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.   Cut to the movie theater; two young men are sitting behind G and Victoria  MAN NO.1  Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?  MAN NO.2  Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!   ( They kick G and Victoria's seats ) VICTORIA  What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?  GEORGE  That won't be necessary.  ( G gets up and turns towards the two men ) GEORGE  Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll   shut'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!   ( People applaud as G sits down again )  Cut to G's car VICTORIA  Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.  GEORGE  I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.  VICTORIA  Who are you, George Costanza? GEORGE  I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.   Cut to movie theater. Elaine is waiting for someone THEATER MANAGER  Excuse me, is your name Elaine? ELAINE  Yes. THEATER MANAGER  Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?  ELAINE  Yeah. THEATER MANAGER  Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.  ELAINE  An accident? What happened? THEATER MANAGER  He got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent   Hospital, room 907. ELAINE  Oh. Ok. Thank you.  ( She starts to leave, but changes her mind and goes back to the counter )  ELAINE  Could I have a box of Jujyfruit?  Cut to hospital JAKE  So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.  ELAINE  ( With her mouth full of Jujyfruit ) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.   ( Jake looks at E eating ) ELAINE  You want one? JAKE  No thanks. ELAINE  So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?  JAKE  Where did you get those? ELAINE  At the movies. JAKE  Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?  ELAINE  Yeah, he did. JAKE  Then when did you get those? ELAINE  Right after ... that ... JAKE  So you heard that I was in a car accident , and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?  ELAINE  Well... the counter...was right there, and...  JAKE  I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.  ELAINE  No, no, it does! JAKE  If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!  ELAINE  But...Jake... JAKE  I would like to be alone now, please.  ELAINE  But, Jake, I didn't... JAKE  Goodnight!  Elaine is forced to leave. We cut to Jerry's apartment. He's having a poker night.  MAN NO.1  Ah, whaddya say we call it a night?  MAN NO.2  Good idea, I'm kinda tired. MAN NO.3  How'd you do? MAN NO.4  Won 50. MAN NO.2  Lost 72. MAN NO.1  Won 37. MAN NO.3  Lost 15. JERRY  Broke even.  Cut to \"Regis and Kathy Lee\" REGIS  Can I bring out our next guest now?  KATHY LEE  Please, please. REGIS  Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part -  KATHY LEE  I love this. REGIS  It's a coffee table book about coffee tables!  KATHY LEE  Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!  REGIS  I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?  KATHY LEE  I did. REGIS  I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?  KATHY LEE  I love his hair. REGIS  Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome: Kramer!   ( K comes in, kisses Kathy Lee ) KATHY LEE  I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!  REGIS  Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?  KRAMER  Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, Regis... actually, this is a true story. I was skiing at the time.  REGIS  You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, and you're writing books!  KRAMER  Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!  KATHY LEE  Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one.  KRAMER  You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.   ( Demonstrates with his book ) KATHY LEE  Is that fabulous? REGIS  Look at this! KATHY LEE  Is that fabulous? REGIS  Fabulous! KATHY LEE  I want one of these. REGIS  Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?  KATHY LEE  This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.  KRAMER  That's true. That's right. REGIS  Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?  KRAMER  Oh, it's on file, right here. ( points to his head )  REGIS  I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!  KATHY LEE  But he's adorable.  ( Kramer takes a sip of coffee, then spits it out all over Kathy Lee's dress )  REGIS  We'll be right back.  Cut to Jerry's apartment JERRY  So it's all over? ELAINE  Yeah, it got pretty nasty. JERRY  And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?  ELAINE  It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.  JERRY  Why didn't you eat it in the cab? ELAINE  Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.   ( E points to the table ) ELAINE  What's all this? JERRY  Played cards last night. ELAINE  Oh yeah? How'd you do? JERRY  Broke even. ELAINE  You always break even. JERRY  Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!  ELAINE  Do you have twenty bucks? JERRY  What for? ELAINE  Just gimme twenty bucks.  ( E takes the money and throws it out the window ) JERRY  What the hell was that? ELAINE  Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.  JERRY  You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.  ELAINE  You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job   promotion, we were talking about moving in together - JERRY  Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.   ( George comes in ) GEORGE  Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -  JERRY  Bad. GEORGE  Day was - ELAINE  Night. GEORGE  Yes! JERRY  So you just did the opposite of everything?  GEORGE  Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion.  JERRY  So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.   ( George rushes out, J+E follow him. J puts his hand in his pocket )  JERRY  Elaine ... look! A twenty! ELAINE  Oh my God.  Cut to Mr.Lippman's office KRAMER  Hey boss. MR. LIPPMAN  Kramer. Come in. KRAMER  How're you doin' there, big guy? ( Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian )  MR. LIPPMAN  Have a seat. KRAMER  What, have you got yourself a cold?   ( Mr. L sneezes, K jumps in his chair ) KRAMER  Wow, that's quite a honk! Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.  MR. LIPPMAN  The reason I asked you in here, is I caught your appearance on \"Regis and Kathy Lee\" the other day and -  KRAMER  It was pretty good, huh?  ( New sneeze, K jumps again ) MR. LIPPMAN  Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best if you didn't do any more of these shows.  KRAMER  Because of the coffee thing? MR.LIPPMAN  Kramer, I'm sorry. KRAMER  What about \"Sonia Live\"? Now you're not cancelling \"Sonia Live\"?  MR. LIPPMAN  It's out - KRAMER  She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.  MR. LIPPMAN  Kramer, I -  ( Mr. L sneezes again, K falls out of his chair )  Cut to Yankee Stadium, and G's job interview MR. CUSHMAN  Why don't you tell me about some of your previous job experiences?  GEORGE  Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.  MR. CUSHMAN  Go on. GEORGE  Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.  MR. CUSHMAN  Do you talk to everybody like this?  GEORGE  Of course. MR. CUSHMAN  My niece told me you were different.  GEORGE  I am different, yeah. MR. CUSHMAN  I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.   ( Mr. Cushman gets out of his chair ) MR. CUSHMAN  Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.  MR. STEINBRENNER  Nice to meet you. GEORGE  Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!  MR. STEINBRENNER  Hire this man!  Cut to Pendant Publishing SECRETARY  Tina Robbins is here to see you. MAN  Who's that? ELAINE  Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, but I've been sub-   letting my apartment from her. MAN  Alright, see ya. ( Meets Tina in the door ) Hey.  TINA  Please. ELAINE  Hi Tina. TINA  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  So, I haven't seen you in a while.  TINA  Elaine, we have a problem. ELAINE  Well, what is it? TINA  You're getting kicked out. ELAINE  Kicked out?! Why?! TINA  Well, there's been a number of complaints.  ELAINE  Yeah? Like what? TINA  Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.  ELAINE  I didn't know who he was! TINA  That's why there's a buzzer. ELAINE  What else? TINA  Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.  ELAINE  What else have you got? TINA  Well, let's see. ( Takes out a list from her bag )   Cut to Monk's JERRY  I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.  RACHEL  I suppose... JERRY  Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.  RACHEL  Jerry ... JERRY  Yes? RACHEL  I've been doing a lot of thinking.  JERRY  Aha? RACHEL  Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.  JERRY  Oh, that's okay. RACHEL  What? JERRY  Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.  RACHEL  You will? JERRY  Sure. See, things always even out for me.  RACHEL  Huh? JERRY  It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And ... good luck!  RACHEL  Yeah, you too.  Jerry leaves. Cut to Jerry's apartment JERRY  The New York Yankees?! GEORGE  The New York Yankees! JERRY  Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?  GEORGE  I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!  JERRY  I can't believe it.  ( The door buzzes, J lets E up ) GEORGE  And I' moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?  JERRY  That's a great place! GEORGE  I'm back in business, baby! JERRY  George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.  GEORGE  Hey! ( to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful )  JERRY  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  Hi. JERRY  How're things going? ELAINE  How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!  JERRY  Why? Why are they doing that? ELAINE  I don't know! They have a list of grievances.  JERRY  The jewel thief? ELAINE  Yeah, the jewel thief. JERRY  What else? ELAINE  I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta be out by the end of the month.  GEORGE  Well, you could move in with my parents.  ELAINE  Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just instinct? ( She squeezes G's mouth between her fingers )  GEORGE  Instinct. ELAINE  Stick ... with the opposite. ( Slaps G on the forehead )  JERRY  Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?   Cut to Pendant Publishing SECRETARY  Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.  MR. LIPPMAN  Alright... tell them I'll be right there. Well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.   ( Mr Lippman leaves the room, and forgets his handkerchief, which he probably needs because of his cold, and Elaine can't tell him, 'cos she's got her mouth full of Jujyfruit...)   ( Mr Lippman goes to meet the Japansese businessmen, then he sneezes, and realizes he doesn't have his handkerchief, but he is forced to meet the Japanese, as they have already spotted him and started talking to him )  INTERPRETER  Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.   ( The Japansese \"boss\" reaches out his hand to shake Mr L's )  MR LIPPMAN  I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.   ( This leads to a loud discussion in Japanese, and we sense a rather hostile atmosphere )   Cut to George's parents' house JERRY  Is that the end of it? GEORGE  Yeah, it's the last one. ESTELLE  I can't believe you're moving out. ( Grabs Kramer ) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.  KRAMER  Oh, it's true. GEORGE  Alright, let's go. FRANK  Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. ( Slaps G's forehead )  GEORGE  I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.  ESTELLE  Jerry, did you hear this? JERRY  He knows what he's doing.  ( G pulls both his parents to him ) GEORGE  I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.   ( K and J look at each other ) JERRY  Opposite.  Cut to Monk's ELAINE  I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!  JERRY  Why'd you have to eat so many? ELAINE  Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.  JERRY  Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.  KRAMER  Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose?  ELAINE  Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.  JERRY  Don't say that. ELAINE  It's true. I'm George! I'm George!   ( Enter George, dressed in A Yankees suit ) GEORGE  Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! ( Sits down, says to waitress:)   Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. ( Turns to the Gang ) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - he's the first base man. We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , \"Danny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.\" Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.   ( J and K pay the check ) KRAMER  Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.  JERRY  Ah ... let's call it even.  (Comedy club) JERRY  Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee. THE END>",

I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically speaking, but ... I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party. It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong.   ( A waitress comes up to G ) WAITRESS  Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.  GEORGE  Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted ... and a cup of tea.  ELAINE  Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.  JERRY  You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cos salmon swim against the current, and the tuna swim with it.  GEORGE  Good for the tuna.  ( A blonde looks at George ) ELAINE  Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.  GEORGE  So what? What am I supposed to do?  ELAINE  Go talk to her. GEORGE  Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.  JERRY  Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.  GEORGE  Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.  JERRY  If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.  GEORGE  Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do   something!  ( He goes over to the woman ) GEORGE  Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.  VICTORIA  Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.   ( G takes a deep breath ) GEORGE  My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.  VICTORIA  I'm Victoria. Hi.  Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone. JERRY  Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye.   ( Enter Kramer ) KRAMER  Hey. Buddy, it's all happening! JERRY  What's happening? KRAMER  The coffee table book. It's a go! JERRY  Oh yeah, I heard all about it. KRAMER  You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop: Regis and Kathy Lee.  JERRY  You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?  KRAMER  Oh, you better believe it! JERRY  I'll loan you my puffy shirt. KRAMER  No,no,no. JERRY  What're you gonna talk about? KRAMER  Well, coffee tables.  ( The phone rings ) JERRY  Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye.   ( Turns to K ) JERRY  You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.  KRAMER  You know who you are? Even Steven  Cut to G's car; G and Victoria driving VICTORIA  Are you growing a beard? GEORGE  Why shave every day? It just grows right back.  VICTORIA  I guess ... GEORGE  I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.   ( A car cuts in in front of them, G has to make a sudden maneuver )  VICTORIA  Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!  GEORGE  Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.   Cut to the movie theater; two young men are sitting behind G and Victoria  MAN NO.1  Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?  MAN NO.2  Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!   ( They kick G and Victoria's seats ) VICTORIA  What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?  GEORGE  That won't be necessary.  ( G gets up and turns towards the two men ) GEORGE  Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll   shut'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!   ( People applaud as G sits down again )  Cut to G's car VICTORIA  Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.  GEORGE  I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.  VICTORIA  Who are you, George Costanza? GEORGE  I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.   Cut to movie theater. Elaine is waiting for someone THEATER MANAGER  Excuse me, is your name Elaine? ELAINE  Yes. THEATER MANAGER  Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?  ELAINE  Yeah. THEATER MANAGER  Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.  ELAINE  An accident? What happened? THEATER MANAGER  He got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent   Hospital, room 907. ELAINE  Oh. Ok. Thank you.  ( She starts to leave, but changes her mind and goes back to the counter )  ELAINE  Could I have a box of Jujyfruit?  Cut to hospital JAKE  So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.  ELAINE  ( With her mouth full of Jujyfruit ) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.   ( Jake looks at E eating ) ELAINE  You want one? JAKE  No thanks. ELAINE  So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?  JAKE  Where did you get those? ELAINE  At the movies. JAKE  Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?  ELAINE  Yeah, he did. JAKE  Then when did you get those? ELAINE  Right after ... that ... JAKE  So you heard that I was in a car accident , and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?  ELAINE  Well... the counter...was right there, and...  JAKE  I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.  ELAINE  No, no, it does! JAKE  If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!  ELAINE  But...Jake... JAKE  I would like to be alone now, please.  ELAINE  But, Jake, I didn't... JAKE  Goodnight!  Elaine is forced to leave. We cut to Jerry's apartment. He's having a poker night.  MAN NO.1  Ah, whaddya say we call it a night?  MAN NO.2  Good idea, I'm kinda tired. MAN NO.3  How'd you do? MAN NO.4  Won 50. MAN NO.2  Lost 72. MAN NO.1  Won 37. MAN NO.3  Lost 15. JERRY  Broke even.  Cut to \"Regis and Kathy Lee\" REGIS  Can I bring out our next guest now?  KATHY LEE  Please, please. REGIS  Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part -  KATHY LEE  I love this. REGIS  It's a coffee table book about coffee tables!  KATHY LEE  Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!  REGIS  I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?  KATHY LEE  I did. REGIS  I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?  KATHY LEE  I love his hair. REGIS  Yeah, oh, I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway, if you will, would you please welcome: Kramer!   ( K comes in, kisses Kathy Lee ) KATHY LEE  I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!  REGIS  Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?  KRAMER  Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, Regis... actually, this is a true story. I was skiing at the time.  REGIS  You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, and you're writing books!  KRAMER  Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!  KATHY LEE  Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one.  KRAMER  You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.   ( Demonstrates with his book ) KATHY LEE  Is that fabulous? REGIS  Look at this! KATHY LEE  Is that fabulous? REGIS  Fabulous! KATHY LEE  I want one of these. REGIS  Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?  KATHY LEE  This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.  KRAMER  That's true. That's right. REGIS  Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?  KRAMER  Oh, it's on file, right here. ( points to his head )  REGIS  I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!  KATHY LEE  But he's adorable.  ( Kramer takes a sip of coffee, then spits it out all over Kathy Lee's dress )  REGIS  We'll be right back.  Cut to Jerry's apartment JERRY  So it's all over? ELAINE  Yeah, it got pretty nasty. JERRY  And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?  ELAINE  It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.  JERRY  Why didn't you eat it in the cab? ELAINE  Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.   ( E points to the table ) ELAINE  What's all this? JERRY  Played cards last night. ELAINE  Oh yeah? How'd you do? JERRY  Broke even. ELAINE  You always break even. JERRY  Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!  ELAINE  Do you have twenty bucks? JERRY  What for? ELAINE  Just gimme twenty bucks.  ( E takes the money and throws it out the window ) JERRY  What the hell was that? ELAINE  Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.  JERRY  You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.  ELAINE  You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job   promotion, we were talking about moving in together - JERRY  Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.   ( George comes in ) GEORGE  Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -  JERRY  Bad. GEORGE  Day was - ELAINE  Night. GEORGE  Yes! JERRY  So you just did the opposite of everything?  GEORGE  Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion.  JERRY  So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.   ( George rushes out, J+E follow him. J puts his hand in his pocket )  JERRY  Elaine ... look! A twenty! ELAINE  Oh my God.  Cut to Mr.Lippman's office KRAMER  Hey boss. MR. LIPPMAN  Kramer. Come in. KRAMER  How're you doin' there, big guy? ( Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian )  MR. LIPPMAN  Have a seat. KRAMER  What, have you got yourself a cold?   ( Mr. L sneezes, K jumps in his chair ) KRAMER  Wow, that's quite a honk! Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.  MR. LIPPMAN  The reason I asked you in here, is I caught your appearance on \"Regis and Kathy Lee\" the other day and -  KRAMER  It was pretty good, huh?  ( New sneeze, K jumps again ) MR. LIPPMAN  Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best if you didn't do any more of these shows.  KRAMER  Because of the coffee thing? MR.LIPPMAN  Kramer, I'm sorry. KRAMER  What about \"Sonia Live\"? Now you're not cancelling \"Sonia Live\"?  MR. LIPPMAN  It's out - KRAMER  She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.  MR. LIPPMAN  Kramer, I -  ( Mr. L sneezes again, K falls out of his chair )  Cut to Yankee Stadium, and G's job interview MR. CUSHMAN  Why don't you tell me about some of your previous job experiences?  GEORGE  Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.  MR. CUSHMAN  Go on. GEORGE  Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.  MR. CUSHMAN  Do you talk to everybody like this?  GEORGE  Of course. MR. CUSHMAN  My niece told me you were different.  GEORGE  I am different, yeah. MR. CUSHMAN  I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen.   ( Mr. Cushman gets out of his chair ) MR. CUSHMAN  Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.  MR. STEINBRENNER  Nice to meet you. GEORGE  Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!  MR. STEINBRENNER  Hire this man!  Cut to Pendant Publishing SECRETARY  Tina Robbins is here to see you. MAN  Who's that? ELAINE  Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, but I've been sub-   letting my apartment from her. MAN  Alright, see ya. ( Meets Tina in the door ) Hey.  TINA  Please. ELAINE  Hi Tina. TINA  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  So, I haven't seen you in a while.  TINA  Elaine, we have a problem. ELAINE  Well, what is it? TINA  You're getting kicked out. ELAINE  Kicked out?! Why?! TINA  Well, there's been a number of complaints.  ELAINE  Yeah? Like what? TINA  Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.  ELAINE  I didn't know who he was! TINA  That's why there's a buzzer. ELAINE  What else? TINA  Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.  ELAINE  What else have you got? TINA  Well, let's see. ( Takes out a list from her bag )   Cut to Monk's JERRY  I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.  RACHEL  I suppose... JERRY  Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.  RACHEL  Jerry ... JERRY  Yes? RACHEL  I've been doing a lot of thinking.  JERRY  Aha? RACHEL  Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.  JERRY  Oh, that's okay. RACHEL  What? JERRY  Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.  RACHEL  You will? JERRY  Sure. See, things always even out for me.  RACHEL  Huh? JERRY  It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And ... good luck!  RACHEL  Yeah, you too.  Jerry leaves. Cut to Jerry's apartment JERRY  The New York Yankees?! GEORGE  The New York Yankees! JERRY  Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?  GEORGE  I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!  JERRY  I can't believe it.  ( The door buzzes, J lets E up ) GEORGE  And I' moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?  JERRY  That's a great place! GEORGE  I'm back in business, baby! JERRY  George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.  GEORGE  Hey! ( to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful )  JERRY  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  Hi. JERRY  How're things going? ELAINE  How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!  JERRY  Why? Why are they doing that? ELAINE  I don't know! They have a list of grievances.  JERRY  The jewel thief? ELAINE  Yeah, the jewel thief. JERRY  What else? ELAINE  I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta be out by the end of the month.  GEORGE  Well, you could move in with my parents.  ELAINE  Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just instinct? ( She squeezes G's mouth between her fingers )  GEORGE  Instinct. ELAINE  Stick ... with the opposite. ( Slaps G on the forehead )  JERRY  Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?   Cut to Pendant Publishing SECRETARY  Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.  MR. LIPPMAN  Alright... tell them I'll be right there. Well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.   ( Mr Lippman leaves the room, and forgets his handkerchief, which he probably needs because of his cold, and Elaine can't tell him, 'cos she's got her mouth full of Jujyfruit...)   ( Mr Lippman goes to meet the Japansese businessmen, then he sneezes, and realizes he doesn't have his handkerchief, but he is forced to meet the Japanese, as they have already spotted him and started talking to him )  INTERPRETER  Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.   ( The Japansese \"boss\" reaches out his hand to shake Mr L's )  MR LIPPMAN  I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.   ( This leads to a loud discussion in Japanese, and we sense a rather hostile atmosphere )   Cut to George's parents' house JERRY  Is that the end of it? GEORGE  Yeah, it's the last one. ESTELLE  I can't believe you're moving out. ( Grabs Kramer ) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.  KRAMER  Oh, it's true. GEORGE  Alright, let's go. FRANK  Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. ( Slaps G's forehead )  GEORGE  I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.  ESTELLE  Jerry, did you hear this? JERRY  He knows what he's doing.  ( G pulls both his parents to him ) GEORGE  I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.   ( K and J look at each other ) JERRY  Opposite.  Cut to Monk's ELAINE  I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!  JERRY  Why'd you have to eat so many? ELAINE  Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.  JERRY  Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.  KRAMER  Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose?  ELAINE  Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.  JERRY  Don't say that. ELAINE  It's true. I'm George! I'm George!   ( Enter George, dressed in A Yankees suit ) GEORGE  Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! ( Sits down, says to waitress:)   Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. ( Turns to the Gang ) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - he's the first base man. We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , \"Danny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.\" Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.   ( J and K pay the check ) KRAMER  Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.  JERRY  Ah ... let's call it even.  (Comedy club) JERRY  Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee. THE END>",

        "text": "   THE BIG SALAD Written by   Larry David   (Comedy club)  It's fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that they're  manufacturing millions of pens; constantly we're all buying them. I must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. I've used up maybe two of them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator there's a couple back there but it doesn't account for it. Where are all the pens? That's why it's so embarrassing if you don't have one. You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen? We always have to whisper because it's so humiliating. I don't have a pen. They're making millions of them every week! I know; where are they?   (Stationery store) STATIONER  May I help you? ELAINE  Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.  STATIONER  Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000. ELAINE  No, I'm sure you do. STATIONER  They're pretty expensive. ELAINE  Well, it's for my boss. STATIONER  What do you do? STATIONER  Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is?  ELAINE  Elaine. STATIONER  Elaine, . . . and your last name? ELAINE  It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha  STATIONER  And your number? ELAINE  Uh, aw, KL5-239O. STATIONER  Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me.  ELAINE  Okay, (to Jerry)  Move  along. . .  JERRY  Why did you give him MY number?  (On the street) ELAINE  I think he's got ideas. JERRY  I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?  JERRY  Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?   (On the street) ELAINE  Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?  JERRY  Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.  GEORGE  Hey, hey. ELAINE  Hey hey JULIE  Hi Jerry. JERRY  Hi Julie. GEORGE  Elaine, Julie. ELAINE  Hi. JULIE  Hi. JULIE  Oh, hi.  Elaine's my middle name. ELAINE  Oh, mine's \"Ike\". GEORGE  Hey, wanna get some lunch? JERRY  Just had a big bowl of Kix. GEORGE  Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?  ELAINE  Ah, no. JULIE  Please come, Elaine. ELAINE  No, no. How about if you bring me back something?  GEORGE  Sure, all right, what do you want?  ELAINE  Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?  GEORGE  What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.  ELAINE  They have big salads. GEORGE  I've never seen a big salad. ELAINE  They have a big salad. GEORGE  Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?  ELAINE  It's okay, you don't... GEORGE  No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?  JERRY  Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.  GEORGE  (???), we'll see you in a little while.   (Jerry's) ELAINE  Maybe I should just get married. JERRY  Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?  ELAINE  I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.  JERRY  People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.  ELAINE  You can say that again. JERRY  It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.  ELAINE  Good for you. JERRY  I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.  ELAINE  Right on baby. (???)  (noise from hall) JERRY  What was that?  (Kramer enters with his golf clubs) KRAMER  That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.  ELAINE  Who Gendason? KRAMER  Steve Gendason. .ELAINE  Why is that name familiar? HX  He used to be a baseball player. ELAINE  Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?  KRAMER  Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.  ELAINE  So what? KRAMER  Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.  JERRY  Certainly are. KRAMER  Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.  Jx; Ah, so what happened? KRAMER  He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .  JERRY  All right. You're in MY face. ELAINE  I still don't see what the big deal is.  KRAMER  A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.   (Monks) JULIE  I like Anna ???'s column and Sapphire. Don't you like Sapphire?  GEORGE  Oh, Sapphire. Uh ha JULIE  Although at times can be rather pedantic.  GEORGE  He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.  JULIE  And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.  GEORGE  Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No \"r\" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. \"Hebert\" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I   got it. JULIE  No, no. I'd like to take you out. GEORGE  No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.  JULIE  Okay, thanks, George. WX  Here's your big salad to go. JULIE  Oh, thank you.  (Jerry's) JERRY  (on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.  ELAINE  I told ya'. He has ideas. JERRY  He doesn't even care if a man answers.  ELAINE  Or you.  (George and Julie enter) GEORGE  Hey, hey. ELAINE  Hey. JULIE  Sorry e're late. ELAINE  No problem. JULIE  Here's your big salad. ELAINE  Thank you, Julie. JULIE  Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?  GEORGE  No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.  JULIE  Sure, George. GEORGE  Ya, you go. JULIE  Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.  JERRY  Bye bye  (Julie exits) GEORGE  Did you see what just happened? JERRY  Well, that all depends. . . GEORGE  Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?  JERRY  Yeah, so? GEORGE  Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.  JERRY  Is that a fact? GEORGE  Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.  JERRY  No it isn't. GEORGE  I mean I'm the one who bought it. JERRY  Yes you did. GEORGE  You think she should have said something?  JERRY  She could have. GEORGE  Oh, I know. JERRY  Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.  GEORGE  You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.  JERRY  Obviously.  (Kramer rushes in) KRAMER  Turn on the TV. JERRY  What? KRAMER  I'm puttin it on... TV  . . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.  KRAMER  Jerry . . . JERRY  Well, it has nothing to do with you.  KRAMER  Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.  JERRY  Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.   (In a cab) ELAINE  I like Julie. She's very personable.  GEORGE  Yeah, she's very lovely. ELAINE  That's great George. GEORGE  So did you enjoy your lunch? ELAINE  Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?  GEORGE  oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .  ELAINE  Even though what? GEORGE  . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?  ELAINE  What? What are you trying to say, George?  GEORGE  It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.  ELAINE  You want the money for the big salad, George?  GEORGE  No, no, ELAINE  What is the problem? GEORGE  There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.   (Jerry's) JERRY  And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.  MARGARET  Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.  JERRY  Ah, no , I don't think so. MARGARET  Why not? JERRY  We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.  MARGARET  Who is staring? JERRY  Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.   (Phone rings) JERRY  Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.   (Newman enters) JERRY  Hello Newman. MARGARET  Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.  JERRY  No, no I don't. Why? MARGARET  You know, Genderson. This is something big.  JERRY  I suppose. MARGARET  What did Kramer say? JERRY  I don't know. Nothing.? MARGARET  Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?  MARGARET  Hello. JERRY  You two know each other? NEWMAN  You might say that. MARGARET  We used to go out. NEWMAN  Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe  JERRY  . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?  MARGARET  Just a few times. JERRY  Why? MARGARET  I liked him. JERRY  You liked, Newman? MARGARET  Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?  JERRY  No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.  MARGARET  He ended it. JERRY  . . . HE ended it? MARGARET  YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?  JERRY  No, no of course not.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Jerry, Jerry they found a tee. JERRY  What tee? KRAMER  A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.  (Monk's) JERRY  Newman! She went out with Newman! ELAINE  It must be a mistake. JERRY  No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?  ELAINE  Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.  JERRY  No, there's less. ELAINE  It's possible. JERRY  No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.  ELAINE  He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.  JERRY  Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.  WX  Would you like some more coffee? JERRY  No,, but thank you. JERRY  Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.  ELAINE  Ugh! You are kidding me. JERRY  No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.  ELAINE  I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.  JERRY  Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.  ELAINE  To please Mr. Pitt. JERRY  Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.  ELAINE  Uh, great! JERRY  Hi Julie. JERRY  Hi. ELAINE  Hi Julie. JERRY  Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.  ELAINE  Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.  JERRY  How do you know THAT?  (Newman's apartment)  (knock knock) NEWMAN  Who is it. JERRY  It's Jerry. NEWMAN  You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?  JERRY  Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR! NEWMAN  Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?  JERRY  Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?  NEWMAN  There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?  JERRY  No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?  NEWMAN  Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.  JERRY  Noit your type? NEWMAN  Not really. JERRY  Well, how come? NEWMAN  Ah, she just didn't do it for me. JERRY  What, what is wrong with her? NEWMAN  Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.  JERRY  You don't think she's attractive? NEWMAN  No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.  JERRY  Okay, Newman, thanks a lot. NEWMAN  Care for some lemonade? JERRY  No, thank you. NEWMAN  Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha   (Jerry's apartment) KRAMER  Listen to this, \"If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. \" That's a rule, Jerry.  JERRY  But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?  KRAMER  Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.  JERRY  What are you so worried about this for?  KRAMER  You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?  JERRY  He did? KRAMER  Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.  JERRY  So it had nothing to do with you. KRAMER  Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.  JERRY  No, I don't think so. KRAMER  Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus. JERRY  Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.  JERRY  Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?  KRAMER  Oh, I love curls. JERRY  Yeah,, me too. KRAMER  All right, I'll see you later. JERRY  Where you going? KRAMER  Genderson's. JERRY  You're going to see Genderson? KRAMER  It's weighing on my conscience.  (Monk's) GEORGE  You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?  JULIE  Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.  GEORGE  A ha! We're just friends. JULIE  Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.  GEORGE  Oh, share. JULIE  Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.  GEORGE  Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.  JULIE  Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?  GEORGE  Well, she probably just assumed. JULIE  Um, did she? GEORGE  . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?  JULIE  That's what I'm suggesting. GEORGE  . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?  JULIE  George, all I did was hand someone a bag.   (Julie leaves)  (Stationery store) ELAINE  It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.  STATIONER  Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else?  ELAINE  No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.  STATIONER  I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman.  ELAINE  Really? A fight with the foreman? STATIONER  Yes. ELAINE  Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.  STATIONER  Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight?  ELAINE  Okay.  (In Margaret's car) MARGARET  I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.  JERRY  You had how many dates with him? Three?  MARGARET  Around three. I don't know. JERRY  And . . MARGARET  I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?  JERRY  What? I'm not looking. Nothing. JERRY  Why are you looking at my face? JERRY  Where am I going to look? MARGARET  Kiss me. JERRY  . . . I can't.  (Throws Jerry out onto sidewalk and drives off) JERRY  Newman!  (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.  ELAINE  Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.  JERRY  You're going out with the stationery store guy?  ELAINE  I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.   (George enters, upset) ELAINE  Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.  ELAINE  Uh, uh. GEORGE  You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.   (phone rings) JERRY  Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.  TV  As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies.  POLICE  9-1-1 What are you reporting KRAMER  Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.  POLICE  Okay, sir, and what's your name? KRAMER  My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!  GENDERSON  I told you not to take the turnpike.  KRAMER  I thought we would blend in. GENDERSON  If we took the palisades this never have happened.  KRAMER  we would have had all that bridge traffic.  GENDERSON  Ah, just drive.  (Comedy club) JERRY  Jail doesn't really seem like that great of revenge. Wouldn't years of subtle psychological mind games be a lot more satisfying? Constantly calling him, hanging up when he answers the phone. Sending pizzas and taxis to their house all night long. After a while he would go, \"I wish that guy would kill me already, I can't take it anymore.\" And how come when the police catch some really bad criminal or something they put him in the handcuffs, they hit him with the baton, they put the choke hold on him, then they're always careful they don't want him to hurt his head when they're putting him in the back of the patrol car. \"Watch your head, watch your head. Don't hit that metal edge there. . . . That REALLY hurts\"  THE END>",

        "text": "  THE PLEDGE DRIVE Written by        Tom Gammill &amp; Max Pross   (Comedy club)  There's something very insincere about these greeting cards we send back and forth to each other all the time. They're like these little one-dollar folded paper emotional prostitutes, isn't it? \"I don't know what my feelings are, so I'll just pay some total stranger a buck to make up this little Hallmark hooker to do the job for me. So I can go, 'Yeah, I didn't write this, but whatever they wrote, I think the same thing.'\" Wouldn't it be better if we just had one card that covered every occasion for everybody in one shot? Just \"Happy birthday, merry Christmas, happy anniversary, congratulations, it's a Boy and our deepest sympathies. Signed, the whole office\"  Elaine and Jerry and in Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?  JERRY  Your friend, Noreen. ELAINE  Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?  JERRY  If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little   less annoying than Noreen. ELAINE  I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.  JERRY  If you don't believe me, ask her. ELAINE  I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house? JERRY  Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.  ELAINE  Yeah.  Kramer enters. KRAMER  Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?  JERRY  Check the pile. KRAMER  Oh, who sent you a card? JERRY  I don't know. KRAMER  Open it, it's from Hallmark. JERRY  Oh. KRAMER  Hello, my love. ELAINE  Hello, darling. JERRY  Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.  KRAMER  Let me see. ELAINE  Who's Kristin? JERRY  She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.  KRAMER  Did you ask her about me? JERRY  Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone. KRAMER  Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right? JERRY  No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station. KRAMER  Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right? JERRY  Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.   Kramer leaves, satisfied. ELAINE  You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.  JERRY  Oh, go ahead. ELAINE  You sure you don't mind? JERRY  Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.   Elaine finishes dialing, the phone rings and a high pitched voice answers.  HIGH PITCHED VOICE  Hello? ELAINE  Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.  HIGH PITCHED VOICE  Jerry? ELAINE  Jerry Seinfeld. HIGH PITCHED VOICE  Oh, I like Jerry a lot. ELAINE  You mean like like? HIGH PITCHED VOICE  What are you talking about? ELAINE  Noreen, were you hitting on him?  Cut to the other end of the conversation, there's a bald man on the telephone.  HIGH PITCHED VOICE  Noreen's not here, this is Dan. ELAINE  Ooh. DAN  You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?  ELAINE  Uh, I'll call you back later. ELAINE  Uh oh. JERRY  So was I right? She likes me, right?   Elaine is sharpening pencils for Mr. Pitt. The phone is ringing.  MR. PITT  Hello? (to Elaine) It's for you. Must you keep giving my number out? ELAINE  Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello? HIGH PITCHED VOICE  Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld? ELAINE  Is this Noreen? HIGH PITCHED VOICE  What would ever possess you to make up a story like that. ELAINE  Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--  DAN  I think I deserve an explanation. ELAINE  Noreen, are you crying? DAN  No, this is Dan! ELAINE  Oh, hi Dan. MR. PITT  Elaine? Work? ELAINE  Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.  MR. PITT  Who was crying? ELAINE  No one. I'm sorry Mr. Putt, that won't happen again.   Mr. Pitt (unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with  KNIFE AND FORK)  I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.  Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--  Jerry and Kristin, the PBS rep, are in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is reading from a sheet of paper. JERRY  I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.  KRISTIN  Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.  JERRY  Oh, I know you are. KRISTIN  You got the card I sent? JERRY  I did. KRISTIN  So where is it? JERRY  What? KRISTIN  The card. Is this it in the trash?  JERRY  No? KRISTIN  This is my card, you threw it away.  JERRY  Well-- KRISTIN  I put a lot of thought into this card.  JERRY  You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem. KRISTIN  Fine. I gotta get back to the office.  JERRY  Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?  KRISTIN  You have no sentimentality. JERRY  I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy. KRISTIN  Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!  JERRY  Well, but, you see, I saved something!   See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?  Kramer enters as Kristin leaves. KRAMER  New cards, huh? JERRY  No, they're old cards from my grandmother.  KRAMER  Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits. JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Oh, a check. JERRY  Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I   save them. KRAMER  There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?  JERRY  I don't know, it's ten dollars. KRAMER  But you got a whole pile here. 1987?  JERRY  Oh so what. KRAMER  Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face. JERRY  Oh, get out of here. KRAMER  Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.  JERRY  Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.  KRAMER  Yeah.  Jerry and George are at the coffee shop. JERRY  It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it? GEORGE  The rule is a minimum of two days.  JERRY  You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?  GEORGE  I'm making it up. JERRY  I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel. GEORGE  Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.  JERRY  Absolutely. GEORGE  If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.  JERRY  So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.  GEORGE  Let's have it. JERRY  Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me... GEORGE  You want me to ask one of the Yankees.  JERRY  Could you? GEORGE  Alright. I'll run it by a few people.  JERRY  Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.  ELAINE  I should never have made that phone call.  JERRY  Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?  ELAINE  Yes, she's very upset. JERRY  So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?  ELAINE  I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--  GEORGE  Who was flirting with you? JERRY  Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?  GEORGE  She wasn't flirting with you. JERRY  Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on. ELAINE  Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.   Elaine and George laugh derisively. JERRY  Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?  ELAINE  So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork. GEORGE  Really? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Why does he do that? GEORGE  He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars. JERRY  Oh, you know. GEORGE  What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?  WAITRESS  That's the extra toast. Get it? GEORGE  Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here? ELAINE  What? GEORGE  Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.  JERRY  That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.  George is in a meeting at work. GEORGE  So, what do you think? MR. MORGAN  A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven.  GEORGE  Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.  George begins eating a candy bar with knife and fork. MR. MORGAN  Uh, what the hell are you doing? GEORGE  I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?  MR. MORGAN  You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.   Jerry and Kramer are at an ATM. JERRY  Okay, sixty bucks from Nana. KRAMER  Huh? Yeah.  Nana is home knitting, the phone rings. NANA  Hello? VOICE  Hello, this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn. NANA  Chemical Bank? I haven't used that account in months.  VOICE  Well, someone's been cashing the checks and you're overdrawn.   Oh dear. I'll be down there first thing in the morning. VOICE  Wait, we can do this over the  phone.  the alarm, fully dressed, gathers her coat and purse, sighs, and heads for the door.  George, Jerry and Kramer are at the coffee shop. JERRY  You got Danny Tartabull?! GEORGE  You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.  JERRY  Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.  GEORGE  Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.  KRAMER  So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.  GEORGE  Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.  JERRY  Excuse me? GEORGE  Jerry, I'm Yankee management. KRAMER  Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.  JERRY  You're just answering phones! KRAMER  It would put me at ease. GEORGE  Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses. JERRY  Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men  WAITRESS  Oh, you're getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), it comes with your breakfast special. JERRY  Right you are. GEORGE  I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.  WAITRESS  I'll check. GEORGE  I don't believe it, she did it again!  JERRY  Oh, she had an itch. GEORGE  She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me. KRAMER  Yeah, she knew what she was doing.  JERRY  By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.   Nana is standing on a deserted street in front of an abandoned building, checking for an address. A street tough approaches from behind.  STREET TOUGH  Looking for something, lady? NANA  Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block?  STREET TOUGH  The bank? It burned. It's gone! NANA  Oh dear. STREET TOUGH  Now what you wanna do is go down to forty-ninth street, that's the main customer service branch. Ask for Mr. Fleming. He'll help you.   Jerry is in his apartment, the phone rings. JERRY  Hello? UNCLE LEO  Jerry? Hello. JERRY  Uncle Leo!  Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.   Kramer enters. JERRY  Nana's missing? UNCLE LEO  I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years! JERRY  I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.  KRAMER  Yeah, that's right. You did. UNCLE LEO  What kind of checks? JERRY  I think Chemical Bank. KRAMER  Oh, they were Chemical. UNCLE LEO  Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway? JERRY  Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks! KRAMER  Hey, I didn't twist your arm. UNCLE LEO  Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?  JERRY  Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!  KRAMER  Well, don't look at me. JERRY  It's your fault! KRAMER  My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.   Mr. Morgan is sitting at an outdoor cafe, eating a candy bar with a knife and fork. Noreen walks by and takes notice. Cut to Noreen and Elaine seated at the counter at Monk's. NOREEN  So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up. ELAINE  I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.  NOREEN  No, why? ELAINE  Well, you know, because he's a high talker.  NOREEN  He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal.  ELAINE  No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.  NOREEN  Really? ELAINE  You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?  NOREEN  I never noticed that. ELAINE  Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know? NOREEN  Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.  ELAINE  Well, he looks like a man. NOREEN  Yeah. ELAINE  He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.  NOREEN  I guess. ELAINE  I know he belches a lot. NOREEN  Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with him.  ELAINE  Yeah. NOREEN  Hm. He's kind of a  baritone, isn't he? ELAINE  What are you doing? NOREEN  I'm eating this cookie. ELAINE  No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just think of that? NOREEN  No, I've seen people do it. I like it.   George is driving Danny Tartabull to the pledge drive. DANNY TARTABULL  This isn't gonna take long, is it?  GEORGE  Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval. DANNY TARTABULL  I'm sure it's fine. GEORGE  Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger! DANNY TARTABULL  You sure? GEORGE  Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!  DANNY TARTABULL  What are you doing? GEORGE  I'm following him.  Nana is at the bank. BANKER  I'm sorry, the account had insufficient funds. We had to return the checks made out to a Mr. Jerry Seinfeld. NANA  Oh dear, that's my grandson. May I call him now and explain?  BANKER  Oh, certainly.  Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is obsessed, he keeps leaving these annoying messages on my machine.   The phone rings. JERRY  Would you? ELAINE  Hello? NANA  Hello, I need to speak to Jerry. ELAINE  Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you. Listen, Jerry doesn't want to talk to you. Nobody wants to talk to you, so why don't you just drop dead? ELAINE  Heh?  Kramer enters. KRAMER  Any word from Nana? JERRY  No. ELAINE  Nana? JERRY  Yeah, my grandma's missing. ELAINE  Missing? JERRY  Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.  ELAINE  Um, what does Nana sound like? JERRY  Like a grandmother, why? ELAINE  Well... JERRY  Oh, you hung up on my Nana?! ELAINE  I don't know, maybe. JERRY  You told Nana to drop dead?! ELAINE  It's possible. JERRY  Yes, it is! KRAMER  Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.  JERRY  Alright.  George is still driving, he's all worked up. GEORGE  No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!  DANNY TARTABULL  Want this last donut? GEORGE  No, you can have it.  Danny Tartabull begins eating the donut with a knife and fork. George takes notice.  Jerry and Kramer are at PBS. KRAMER  Jerry, where are all the tote bags?  JERRY  I don't know. KRAMER  Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have. KRISTIN  Jerry, this man wants to see you. JERRY  Leo? UNCLE LEO  Hello. JERRY  Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?  UNCLE LEO  I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.  JERRY  Oh. UNCLE LEO  She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.  KRISTIN  Jerry, I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull. Where is he?  JERRY  He'll be here any second. KRISTIN  You know you guys are both on in five minutes.  JERRY  Yeah, yeah. KRISTIN  Okay. UNCLE LEO  Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know. JERRY  No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.  UNCLE LEO  What are you talking about? JERRY  Please- UNCLE LEO  I want- JERRY  It's not necessary. UNCLE LEO  Jerry, would you please take it. JERRY  I can't, I can't take it. UNCLE LEO  I want you to have it! JERRY  Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!  UNCLE LEO  Jerry, take the money! JERRY  I don't want it!!  There's a knock at the door. HIGH PITCHED VOICE  Jerry, open up. We need to talk. KRAMER  Who's that? JERRY  You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store. KRAMER  Jerry, I'll take care of it.  Kramer walks out and sees Dan. DAN  Is Jerry in there? KRAMER  Well, he can't be disturbed now. DAN  Well this situation is driving me crazy. He's all I think about. I can't get him out of my mind. KRAMER  I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man. DAN  What? KRAMER  Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know. DAN  No, I don't. KRISTIN  Are you Danny Tartabull? DAN  No, I'm not.  George is parked at a gas station, he steps out of the car and slams the door.  GEORGE  I'll take care of this, Danny.  George approaches the man he's been following, who's now pumping gas.  GEORGE  Excuse me. MAN  What's the problem? GEORGE  I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.  MAN  I did? Where? GEORGE  Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.  MAN  Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull? GEORGE  That's right, of the New York Yankees.  MAN  I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.   The man holds up his arm, it's in a cast with his middle finger sticking straight up.  Jerry is doing his bit for PBS. JERRY  I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.  Cut to Nana, watching the pledge drive. She picks up the phone and dials.   Cut back to Jerry, JERRY  This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-  Cut to Kramer sitting at the phone bank, his phone rings. KRAMER  PBS pledge drive. NANA  Hello, I'd like to speak with Jerry.  KRAMER  Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen. NANA  This is his grandmother. KRAMER  Oh, uh, Nana. Hello. NANA  Tell Jerry I'm sorry, I'm going to have to write him some new checks.  KRAMER  As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.  Cut back to Jerry. JERRY  -programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here,   I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'  Kramer rises in the background. KRAMER  Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.  JERRY  My Nana? KRAMER  And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!  Everybody applauds as Uncle Leo comes out from sidestage. UNCLE LEO  She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!   Jerry and Elaine are at the coffee shop. JERRY  I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.  ELAINE  Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-  JERRY  Yes, he is. ELAINE  You should show this to Georgie.  Yeah. WAITRESS  Here's your knife and fork. JERRY  Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.  ELAINE  I just don't get it. JERRY  You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&amp;Ms with a spoon.  ELAINE  What is wrong with everybody? JERRY  Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it! ELAINE  What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!! THE END>",

ELAINE     [wry/sarcastic] Don't worry, Jerry,          I can manage these bags; really          I'm     fine.   JERRY     I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns          grow in a little..   ELAINE     Can we rest here a second.   JERRY     [pause] Yeah, I guess.     [She sits on the stairs of a small          entryway.]   JERRY     .. So how's Noreen?   ELAINE     Mm! She's got a new boyfriend:          Paul.   JERRY     Already? That was fast.. I assume          he's not a High Talker..   ELAINE     No, but, he has, The Worst Habit.          Whenever he answers the phone,          he     won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta          go through, like, ten minutes of     chit-chat.   JERRY     A Long Talker.   ELAINE     Yeah! But he is so boring! But          now, whenever he answers the phone:          I     just hang up.   JERRY     [pause] All right; let's move it          out.     [ELAINE gets her bags.]   JERRY     Hey, isn't that George's father?   ELAINE     Oh, yeah, it is! Should we say          hello?   JERRY     I've never seen him in Manhattan          before; it's weird. So out of context.   ELAINE     That man he's with: is he wearing          a cape?   JERRY     I believe he is wearing a cape.   ELAINE     Why is Mr. Costanza with a man          in a cape?   JERRY     Well, it is good cape weather.          Cool. Breezy.   ELAINE     Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape?          Where do you even get a cape?   JERRY     You're right; it is strange. In          fact, let's cross to the other          side of     the street. Cover me.     [ELAINE positions the bags to cover          her face and upper body. JERRY          walks     by her so he's out of view, too.]   [End of Intro-- time: 1:23]     [Commercial Break]          [JERRY and ELAINE arrive at JERRY's          \"house.\"]   JERRY     Just, ah, plop it on the counter          there.     [ELAINE drops one bag deliberately          and throws the others on the counter.     He hadn't helped her at all on          the way--payback time. Then, during          the     following, she spends a lot of          time looking for food in the bags          and     puts some in one bag--presumably          hers.]   JERRY     Oh! I got a message. [presses button          on phone machine]   GEORGE     [on tape] Hey, it's George. I got          nothin' to say.. [beeeep]   ELAINE     That sounds Urgent..   JERRY     Let me call him back..     Hello?? Who is this?     Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must          o' dialed the wrong number.   ELAINE     Donna Chang?   JERRY     [is redialing] Should've talked          to her; I love Chinese women.   ELAINE     Isn't that a little racist?   JERRY     If I like their race, how can that          be racist?..     Hellooo??..     Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!..     Yyy-yes, I am calling George..     Oh, the lines are crossed; you're          getting his calls. Well, what do          you     know?!     [KRAMER comes in. He's got a bottle          of water. JERRY stays on the line          to     chat with Donna.]   JERRY     So listen..   KRAMER     I'm goin' through this stuff like          water.. [to JERRY] Who you talkin'          to?   ELAINE     He's on with a Chinese woman.   KRAMER     Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian          women. [a little distracted, pulling     down his underwear in back, through          his pants]   ELAINE     You got a.. comfort problem there?   KRAMER     Yeah, I think these Jockeys shrunk.   ELAINE     I thought you wore silk underwear.   KRAMER     No. Well, you know, I wore 'em          for about a month but I couldn't          stay     with it. Yeah, I need the secure          packaging of Jockeys. [he's serious.     Then he makes a hand gesture of          grabbing up.] My boys need a house.   ELAINE     [not charmed..] That's nice.     Listen, Kramer, you know, if you          ever want to have kids you shouldn't     wear briefs. Boxers are much better          for your sperm count.   KRAMER     Sperm count?     Well how many ssssperm should I          have?   ELAINE     A lot.     [JERRY comes back. He'd wandered          into the bedroom and is now off          the     phone.]   JERRY     I got a date!   ELAINE     With the Chinese woman?!   JERRY     She knew who I was! She saw me          in a club one time! My first date          ever     with the Pacific Rim. I'm very          excited.   KRAMER     Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm          count checked?   JERRY     No, why should I? I wear boxers.   KRAMER     You ever get a woman pregnant?   JERRY     I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records          are permanently sealed..   KRAMER     What would you say if I told you,          \"I never impregnated a woman\"?   JERRY     Really? You never slipped one past          the goalie in all these years??..     Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept          with a lot of women, I--   KRAMER     A lot of 'em! [wild gesture, freaked          out]     Do you think maybe I'm.. Depleted??!!   JERRY     Well, I'm sure you're not.. Totally          Depleted.   KRAMER     Well, but what if I am? I'm the          last male Kramer! We're facing          extinction!   JERRY     Well, go to a fertility clinic.          Have your sperm count checked.   KRAMER     Yeah, but then I'd have to.. well,          you know.. into a cup? In the middle     of the day??   ELAINE     Does that conflict with your regular          schedule?     [KRAMER, distracted, leaves.]   ELAINE     [going to the phone, she's been          eating chips from small package          of them]     All right. I'm gonna try Noreen          again.   JERRY     I am very excited about this date!          We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!   ELAINE     She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese          food?   JERRY     She suggested it!   ELAINE     I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese..   JERRY     She's very assimilated.     [Elaine's on the phone--we hear          a male, \"Hello?\" on the other end.     ELAINE quickly hangs up.]   JERRY     Paul again?   ELAINE     [matter of fact] You can't get          one ring past him.     [GEORGE comes in.]   GEORGE     Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me          back?!   JERRY     I tried! Your line's crossed with          a Chinese woman!   GEORGE     Uh?   ELAINE     [coming toward GEORGE to sit over          by JERRY, who's on the arm of the     couch. GEORGE is standing.] Hey,          George, we saw your father on the     street before.   GEORGE     What's he doin' in the city today?     [They both shrug.]   GEORGE     You didn't ask him?     [They both shake heads no. Elaine's          eating chips.]   GEORGE     You didn't say hello?   ELAINE     Well, he was with someone.     A man.. In a cape.   GEORGE     Why was he wearing a cape?..     [ELAINE and JERRY shrug.]   GEORGE     Was my father wearing a cape?   JERRY     No. Jacket and tie: no cape.   GEORGE     Huh.. Cape.. [turns, slowly goes          to door] W--a man with a cape doin'     with my father?.. What was my father          doing with a man in a cape? ..     [opens door] Why a cape? [out the          door and gone]   [Fertility clinic. In an examination          room. Kramer's waiting. The DOCTOR     comes in.]   DOCTOR     The results of your sperm test          are in.     Well, ummm.. Are you planning to          start a family?   KRAMER     Yes! I would like to! Very much!..     Well, I'm low, now, aren't I? I          ca--I can feel it!...   DOCTOR     Yes, I'm afraid you're a little          low.   KRAMER     Ohhh. Man!! It's over! The Kramer          name is finished! I'm never goin'          to     procreate! I--   DOCTOR     Hey--that's not necessarily true.          There are measures you can take          to     improve your fertility.   KRAMER     All right, all right. What. What.          You tell me; I'll do anything.          Come     on, Doc, tell me.   DOCTOR     First thing: you should wear boxer          shorts.   KRAMER     All the time?   DOCTOR     All the time. Ya have to get off          Jockeys right away.   KRAMER     Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.   [At Elaine's. She's in her robe          and talking on the phone, blowing          a hair     dryer onto the phone.]   ELAINE     Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling!     Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone          so I don't really have time to          talk.     Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!.. Oh.          She's not?! Okay, great. Well you          can     just tell her I called, then, an'--     Well, yes. It has been unseasonably          cool lately..     Oh, okay, well, I'm pulling up          to the building now. So, I'm gonna..     [a little later, is sitting] Yeah,          I took 20%, too..     Uuum. Look it's uh.. [turns hair          dryer on and off] Paul. The.. car..     seems to be running out of gas.          .. I'm gonna.. have to get off          the     phone. [hangs up]   [Night. The Hunan Balcony. Jerry's          in the waiting area, in a good          mood,     sitting next to a GUY.]   HOSTESS     Just let me know when the rest          of your party has arrived, sir.   JERRY     Yes, I will.   GUY     [indicating a cigarette] Mind?   JERRY     [good mood] No--go ahead--I second-hand          smoke two packs a day.     [DONNA CHANG walks up. She's not          oriental. But is good-looking.]   DONNA     Jerry.   JERRY     [pause] 'scuse me?   DONNA     Hi. Sorry I'm late.   JERRY     Who're you?   DONNA     I'm Donna Chang..   JERRY     [stands, in shock, it's not sinking          in] What do you mean?   DONNA     I mean: I'm Donna Chang.   JERRY     [pause] You're Donna Chang?   DONNA     Did you think I was Chinese?..   JERRY     Oh. No. Oh, you mean because of          the \"Chang\"?   DONNA     Actually, the family name wasn't          originally Chang.   JERRY     I didn't think so.   DONNA     It used to be \"Changstein.\"   [Day. At Jerry's, ELAINE and JERRY.          She's making herself a bowl of     Raisin Bran.]   ELAINE     She's not Chinese?   JERRY     No. Not Chinese.     Not even Asian.   ELAINE     So. What is she?   JERRY     Well, she's.. like you.   ELAINE     [pause] Oh, how.. disappointed          you must have been. [walks to couch,          with     her cereal]   JERRY     Well, it's false advertising, see?          And the thing is, I think she likes     people thinkin' she's Chinese.          She suggests Chinese food. She          always     introduces herself as \"Donna Chang,\"..   ELAINE     So why're you seeing her again..   JERRY     Well, she is a woman.   ELAINE     I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They          might be breakin' up.   JERRY     Really?   ELAINE     Well, maybe.   JERRY     [sits on couch as something occurs          to him] Hey, wouldn't it be funny          if     Paul an' Noreen broke up because          o' you kept hangin' up on him?   ELAINE     [pause] What do you mean?   JERRY     Well, you know if Paul thought          it was some guy.. hangin' up because          he     was having an affair with Noreen?     [As ELAINE considers the implications,          KRAMER comes in. he's got a pile     of underwear in his hands.]   KRAMER     Here. Take my Jockey shorts.     [JERRY leaps up and KRAMER's following          him as JERRY walks backward     around the apartment during the          following.]   ELAINE     Whoa! Whoa!   JERRY     What is that?!!   KRAMER     Look, you gotta help me. I have          to get off Jockey shorts.   JERRY     Wha--you have a low sperm count?   KRAMER     Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take          'em.   JERRY     Nnnoo--I don't want 'em.   KRAMER     Jerry, look! You gotta help me!          I can't have 'em near me! If I          have one     pair in my house, I'm gonna wear          them!   JERRY     Look! I don't want 'em!   KRAMER     All it takes is one pair! Now,          come on!   JERRY     I'm not gonna be able to sleep          if those are in the house!     [KRAMER's put the pile on Jerry's          table and is grabbing at his own     pants.]   KRAMER     Boxers! How do you wear these things!!          Look at that--they're baggin' up,     they're rising in! An' there's          nothing holding me in place! I'm          flip     pin'! I'm floppin'!     [ELAINE's distracted by disgust.]   KRAMER     What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm          goin' crazy in these things! [leaves]   JERRY     [calmly turns back to The Pile          on his table] Well. I'm gonna have          to     move now.   [At Monk's. GEORGE and his FATHER          at a booth.]   FRANK     Ya know what I like about Manhattan?          There's no mosquitoes.   GEORGE     Plenty of mosquitoes.   FRANK     Queens is full of mosquitoes.   GEORGE     So, Dad..   FRANK     Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.   GEORGE     Dad! I heard you were in the city          the other day!   FRANK     Your mother has to tell you every          move I make!?   GEORGE     No.. Jerry and Elaine saw you.   FRANK     They didn't say hello?   GEORGE     Well, they were in a rush.   FRANK     They couldn't just say hello?!          .. Oh, to hell with them.   GEORGE     They, uh.. said you were with some          guy who was wearing a cape, ha          ha.   FRANK     Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello.          She's very--what's the     word--supercilious.   GEORGE     So Dad.   FRANK     How could Jerry not say Hello?!!   [Night. At Jerry's with he and          DONNA CHANG. She's on the couch          and he's     drying the dishes. She's just hung          up the phone.]   JERRY     So did they, uh, uncross the lines,          yet?   DONNA     No. They can't find the problem.          It's really getting ridicurous(sic).   JERRY     [long pause--did he hear \"ridicurous\"(sic)--should          he say something--can't     decide if he should. finally..]          Did you say, \"ridicurous\"(sis)?   DONNA     Ridiculous.   JERRY     [pause] I thought you said.. \"ridicurous.\"(sic)          [he and she look at each     other, puzzled.]     [GEORGE comes in.]   JERRY     Oh, what are you doing here?   GEORGE     Oh, I wanted to, [notices DONNA]          talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't          know     you had company. [JERRY indicates          he should stay] Hi, uh, I'm George.   DONNA     Oh! Hi! [they shake hands] I'm          Donna Chang. [GEORGE to himself          registers     that as weird, is heading to the          kitchen.]     I just spoke to your mother before.   GEORGE     [pause] You spoke to my mother?   DONNA     She was trying to call you, but--   JERRY     The rines(sic) were crossed?     [They both look at him weird.]   GEORGE     Did you say, \"The rines(sic) were          crossed?\"   JERRY     Did I?   DONNA     [pause] George, she's so sweet.          We talked for an hour!     Anyway, I'm really sorry.   GEORGE     Sorry? Why sorry? What do you have          to be sorry for?   DONNA     Well, she told me she and your          father are getting divorced.     [JERRY and DONNA watch as GEORGE          immediately and ritually goes to          the     oven, turns on the gas, opens the          door and sticks his head in it.]   [End of Act I-- time: 10:18]     [Commercial Break]          [Same night, at Jerry's apartment--Donna's          left. Elaine's there.]   ELAINE     Divorced. That's really too bad..   JERRY     Yeah, you know it's a shame his          parents didn't get divorced thirty          years     ago. He could have been normal.   GEORGE     [coming out of bathroom] Oh my          God! You know what I just realized?!          If     they get divorced an' live in two          separate places? That's twice as          many     visits!   JERRY     I never thought of that.   GEORGE     Imagine if I had to see them both          on the same day? [mirthless] Haha!     It's like runnin' the double marathon!   ELAINE     Hey George, did you have any idea          that anything was wrong?   JERRY     Have you ever spent any time with          these people..?   GEORGE     You know what this has to do with?          The man in the cape--I bet you          he is     mixed up in this!     I don't trust men in capes.   JERRY     You can't cast aspersions on someone          just because they're wearin' a     cape. .. Superman wore a cape..          An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna          stand     here an' let you say something          bad about him.   GEORGE     All right Superman's the exception.   ELAINE     [has been watching that with amazed          disbelief]     [KRAMER enters.]   KRAMER     Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that          Noreen and Paul are breaking up.          I     want you to put in a good word          for me. [to JERRY] I've always          had a     thing for Noreen.   ELAINE     Oh, Kramer. You don't understand.          This could be my fault.   KRAMER     Well, if she's available now, I'm          not gonna let her slip through          my     fingers this time. Nooope. [walking          around at ease, some dancy moves]   JERRY     Well it looks like you've adjusted          to the boxers..   KRAMER     Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as          that.   JERRY     You went back to the Jockeys?   KRAMER     Wrong again.   JERRY     [pause] Oh, no.   ELAINE     What? What?..   JERRY     Don't you see what's goin' on here???          .. No boxers, no Jockeys..   ELAINE     Eeaawww...   JERRY     The only thing between him and          us is a thin layer of gabardine..   JERRY     Kramer, say it isn't so.   KRAMER     Oh, it be so.     I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin'          every minute of it!!!   JERRY     Don't you need a little.. help?   KRAMER     Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm          unfettered.. [opens door to leave,     still very happy, then:] I'm like          a naked innocent boy rrroamin'          the     countryside!!   [Day. At Monk's. ELAINE and NOREEN          are sitting at the counter. We're     looking straight at them.]   ELAINE     Well, you guys are tryin' to work          it out! That's great!..   NOREEN     Yeah, well.. We're trying.. He          just went insane there for a while..   ELAINE     Oh, he went insane?..   NOREEN     Believe it or not: Paul was convinced          I was having an affair because     somebody kept calling and hanging          up whenever he answered! What kind          of     a Sick Person calls and hangs up          over and over?   ELAINE     [awkward, defensive yet hypothetical,          avoids eye contact] Well. Uh. I     don't know about sick. I mean,          maybe it was somebody who, didn't          wanna,     talk to whoever was answering because          whoever was answering was always     making, boring chit-chat, an' was          completely oblivious to the fact          that     the person who was calling, didn't          want to speak to them, ah!   NOREEN     [has been growing increasingly          slackjawed in amazement] I can't          believe     that was you..   ELAINE     [looks at NOREEN] I'm really sorry,          Noreen..   NOREEN     [pause] So you thought he was boring?   ELAINE     Hey! Noreen! Don't go by me! Ha          ha.   NOREEN     [reconsidering Paul's worthiness.]   [Day. JERRY and ELAINE at Jerry's          apartment.]   JERRY     What are you doin' to this woman?!          This is the second relationship     you've ruined for her in a few          weeks!!   ELAINE     I know--   JERRY     First you ruin her relationship          with the High Talker.   ELAINE     Well, Jer--I got confused, they          sound exactly the same.   JERRY     So she breaks up with him. Somehow          picks up the pieces of her life.          Miraculously meets: A New Guy!          Ya bust that up! An' then, just          as they're     reconciling, you announce to the          world: He's Boring.   ELAINE     [apologetically] I didn't know          she'd take it so seriously.   JERRY     Well, apparently you have a tremendous          influence over this woman!     Anything you say she does!     [Door bell buzzes. JERRY goes over,          hits the button.]   JERRY     Yeah.   DONNA     It's Donna Chang.   JERRY     [hits button] Come on up.   ELAINE     Well, I guess I just didn't realize          it..   JERRY     Well, let's look back on your history          with this woman. Okay?   ELAINE     Okay..   JERRY     First, you encouraged her to join:          The Army. .. She did.   ELAINE     She was lost..   JERRY     Then: you suggest she goes.. AWOL!          She did!   ELAINE     Well, she didn't seem to be havin'          so much fun..   JERRY     You know.. You better make sure          you never tell this woman to jump          off     the Brooklyn Bridge..   ELAINE     If I have this much influence over          her, why don't I just call her          an'     tell her to get back together with          him--that's aalll!     [DONNA CHANG comes in briskly,          good mood.]   DONNA     Hi.   JERRY     Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine..     [At the same time--DONNA: Helllo..--ELAINE:          Hi! Good to meet you.]   DONNA     [to JERRY] Guess what? Mrs. Costanza          called me, they're not getting     divorced.   JERRY     Why? What happened?   DONNA     Well, she was trying to call George          last night, she got me, we spoke          for     an hour, she changed her mind!!!   JERRY     Wow! That's amazing!   DONNA     Anyway, she wants to meet me! She          invited me over for dinner! She          said     you should come too.   JERRY     Tonight?   DONNA     Yeah--I just remembered: I'm gonna          have to cancel my acupuncture class.     [goes to phone]     [Behind her, JERRY and ELAINE slowly          exchange looks.]   [Same day. At the Costanzas', are          GEORGE, FRANK, and ESTELLE--GEORGE     just entered. ESTELLE's snacking          watching TV.]   GEORGE     All right. Let me just say one          thing: there is no way that this          is goin'     to happen. No Way! Because if you          think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings,     you're out of your minds!!!   ESTELLE     [calmly] We're not getting divorced.   FRANK     You mother changed her mind.. [tries          to catch a fly with his hand]   GEORGE     [glee!] Ya-De! That's Goood! That's          Very good! I'm very glad to hear     that.   FRANK     Yeah. We worked it out.   GEORGE     All right. So let me ask you a          question. Who was the man in the          cape?   FRANK     He was my lawyer.   GEORGE     You lawyer wears a cape..?   FRANK     Yeah. So what?   GEORGE     Who wears a cape?   FRANK     He's very independent; doesn't          follow the trends.   ESTELLE     He looks ridiculous in that thing..   FRANK     You have no eye for fashion!!!   ESTELLE     I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!   GEORGE     All right! Come on!     Let's not fight.     FRANK and ESTELLE     All right! All right!   ESTELLE     Georgie's right.   GEORGE     So what made you change your mind?   ESTELLE     It was that Chinese woman.   [In Jerry's car. Jerry's driving,          DONNA CHANG is with him.]   JERRY     So I'm curious. What'd you tell          Mrs. Costanza that changed her          mind?   DONNA     I mentioned a few bits of wisdom          from Confucius.   JERRY     [pause] Confucius, huh?   DONNA     Yeah.   JERRY     [pause] You know, you're not Chinese...          [The Costanzas again. They open          the door for JERRY and DONNA.]   JERRY     Hey! I heard the good news!   FRANK     Jerry: how come you didn't say          hello to me the other day, huh?!   JERRY     Elaine was.. in a rush.   FRANK     I knew it was Elaine!!   DONNA     You must be Estelle.   ESTELLE     Yes. Who are you..?   DONNA     I'm Donna Chang!   ESTELLE     You're not Chinese!   [Meanwhile, in Noreen's apartment.          NOREEN and KRAMER are sitting on          the     couch when the phone rings. KRAMER          picks it up. Scene cuts back and     forth between ELAINE and them.]   KRAMER     Hello?   ELAINE     Paul?   KRAMER     Elaine!   ELAINE     Kramer?   KRAMER     [pause] Yeahh!   ELAINE     What're you doin' there?   KRAMER     Wellll, isn't it obvious?   ELAINE     Uh! Ah, is Noreen there?   KRAMER     Yes, she is..   ELAINE     Well? Can I talk to her?   KRAMER     What? Am I, tooo.. boring for you?   ELAINE     [tired] Fine--would you just put          her on?   KRAMER     Well, I feel it'd be best if you          just didn't talk to her for a while..   ELAINE     You feel?   KRAMER     That's right!     She an' I have had a very long          talk. An' I was appalled to learn          of the     destructive influence you've had          over her life lo these many years..   ELAINE     What are you insane?!   KRAMER     From now, on, I'll be calling the          shots around here..   ELAINE     Oh! Haha. An' what're you gonna          tell her?   KRAMER     Well. I've encouraged her to go          back into the Army..     There she'll get the structure          an' the discipline she needs right          now..     And she'll have qualified officers          telling her what to do..   ELAINE     Uh! Kramer! You have got to let          me talk to her!   KRAMER     Can't help ya, kid.   [Back at the Costanzas'. Still          daylight.]   ESTELLE     You're not Chinese!?!?   DONNA     [pause] No.   ESTELLE     I thought you were Chinese!!   DONNA     I'm from Long Island.   ESTELLE     Long Island?!?!     I thought I was gettin' advice          from a Chinese woman!!   DONNA     I'm sorry..?   ESTELLE     Well! Then, that changes everything!   GEORGE     What?!   ESTELLE     She's not Chinese; I was duped!!   GEORGE     So what?! She gave you advice;          what's the difference if she's          not Chi     nese?!?!   ESTELLE     I'm not taking advice from some          girl from Long Island!! [goes into   KITCHEN]   GEORGE     [chases her] Wait a minute! You're--now          you're getting a divorce because     she's from Long Island?!?!   FRANK     [from the living room, standing,          shouts after them] You want a     divorce?!!? You got one!!!   JERRY     [pause, to DONNA] You know, you          might wanna think about changin'          your     name..   [Day. JERRY and ELAINE, walking          down the street.]   ELAINE     So, ever since she started dating          Kramer, she won't even talk to          me!   JERRY     Well--Noreen listened to you like          George's mother listened to the     Chinese.   ELAINE     [pause] You know, everybody listens          to the Chinese.     I mean, look at the fortune cookie.          You couldn't get away with that          in     any other restaurant.   JERRY     [has just bought a newspaper out          of a machine] Yeah, no one's reading     any rolled-up messages in a knish..     [A cab pulls up and GEORGE gets          out.]   GEORGE     Oh, it had to happen!! I knew it!!   JERRY     Hey.   GEORGE     I predicted it! [hits cab roof          twice, it drives off]     Saw both of them today!     What a disaster!     I'm runnin' all over Queens. First          I saw my mother. We had lunch     together. Never had, Lunch, with          my mother before--it's like a date!     Then we drive down to Kew Gardens!          Tons of traffic! I see my father.          We     played \"Clue\"! All day with this!     [KRAMER sticks his head out of          his (or Jerry's) apartment window,          shouts     down to them.]   KRAMER     Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer          name might live on! Noreen's late!     She's laaate!! [During credit roll. Night on the          Brooklyn Bridge. NOREEN peers over          the     edge, the wind blowing up on her          face. Then a man in a black cape          edges     over to her cautiously, reaches          and holds her forearm.]   NOREEN     Who are you?!   MAN     [calmly, businesslike] I'm Frank          Costanza's lawyer. [he helps her          get     back off (and out of view of the          camera).]        THE END>",

        "text": "  THE COUCH Written by   Larry David   (Comedy club) JERRY  The love seat, that's a nice little item, there...I guess some guy thought, 'Well, if we can't get them to sit closer to us, why not just shorten the furniture?' My other favorite furniture brand is the La-Z-Boy. This is very flattering to the prospective customer, isn't it? Why don't we just call it the 'half-conscious deadbeat with no job, home all day, eating Cheetos and watching TV' recliner? I mean, it goes back so far, that thing...I mean, it's like, 'Go to bed already! It's over! You're wiped!'   Jerry and George in a furniture store. Jerry is shopping for a new couch.  JERRY  So, she got you to join a book club?  GEORGE  I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.  JERRY  Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?  GEORGE  Nah, I don't like that one. JERRY  So, what's your first book? GEORGE  \"Breakfast At Tiffany's.\" 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)  JERRY  It's kinda old, isn't it? GEORGE  They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.  JERRY  Oh, sure...Truman Capote. GEORGE  He's a great writer. JERRY  Oh, yeah. GEORGE  Did you ever read anything by him?  JERRY  No. You? GEORGE  Nah. JERRY  Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!   Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. The moving guys are delivering Jerry's new couch.  ELAINE  Hey, what's going on? JERRY  New couch, baby! ELAINE  New couch? Why? JERRY  I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.   (Elaine laughs. Carl and another furniture mover come in, and they pick up Jerry's old couch.)  ELAINE  Hello. CARL  Hello. ELAINE  Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!  JERRY  Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.  ELAINE  What are you doing with your old couch?  JERRY  Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?  ELAINE  Yeah, I'll take it. JERRY  Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.  ELAINE  Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.) KRAMER  Hey! Couch is comin.' JERRY  It's here! KRAMER  Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.  JERRY  Yeah. So do I. KRAMER  Ooh! Remember Poppie? JERRY  Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?  KRAMER  Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?  JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  What was that again? KRAMER  It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?  ELAINE  Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!  JERRY  What made you resurrect that old idea?  KRAMER  Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the \"old\" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.  ELAINE  I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.  JERRY  I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?  KRAMER  That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.  ELAINE  Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon! KRAMER  Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.  JERRY  Oh, Kramer, I -  (Kramer turns around and runs smack into Jerry's new couch being brought in by Carl and the other moving guy, and hits the floor. They place the couch in the same spot as the old one.)  JERRY  Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?  ELAINE  Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.  JERRY  Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.  CARL  Sign here. ELAINE  Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.  CARL  Sure. ELAINE  'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?  CARL  Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.  ELAINE  Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)  KRAMER  Did you offer those guys a drink? JERRY  Uh, no. Should I have? KRAMER  What kind of a person are you? JERRY  I don't know.  George at home, preparing to read \"Breakfast At Tiffany's.\"  GEORGE  Okay. \"Breakfast At Tiffany's.\" (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)   Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's Restaurant. ELAINE  So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, \"Do you date moving men?\"  JERRY  Ah ha... ELAINE  You wanna know what I said? JERRY  I can't wait. ELAINE  \"I do now.\" JERRY  Clever. ELAINE  Is that something? JERRY  Yes. ELAINE  Is that something? JERRY  You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.  ELAINE  Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.  JERRY  So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?  ELAINE  Yes. JERRY  Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)  POPPIE  Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.)  JERRY  Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine. ELAINE  Nice to meet you, Poppie. POPPIE  Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!  JERRY  Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.  POPPIE  Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.  ELAINE  Well, your mother must be very proud of you.  POPPIE  My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.  JERRY  So, what's good tonight?  Cut back to George at home. His television program finishes, and he turns off the TV. He stretches, then goes back to reading - not \"Breakfast At Tiffany's\" however, but an issue of Cracked magazine.   Cut back to Jerry and Elaine at Poppie's. ELAINE  Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.  JERRY  Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.  ELAINE  Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.  JERRY  Why not? ELAINE  Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.  JERRY  So, you won't eat the pizza? ELAINE  No way. JERRY  Really. ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?  ELAINE  Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.  JERRY  Really! ELAINE  Yeah. That's right. JERRY  Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)  POPPIE  Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.  JERRY  Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?  POPPIE  When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...  JERRY  Oh, boy. POPPIE  ...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.  ELAINE  Well...Poppie. I think differently.  POPPIE  And what gives you the right to do that?  ELAINE  The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.  WOMAN AT NEXT TABLE  I heard that. Let's go, Henry. HENRY  But we just got here... ELAINE  And I am not coming back! POPPIE  You're not welcome! JERRY  Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)   Jerry and George in a booth at the coffee shop. JERRY  Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.  GEORGE  I'm sorry I missed it. JERRY  Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?  GEORGE  Oh...pretty good. JERRY  So, what's it about? GEORGE  Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.  JERRY  Holly Go-Lightly. GEORGE  Yeah, she's quite a character. JERRY  Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?  GEORGE  No. JERRY  Big surprise. GEORGE  I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.  JERRY  You're not very bright, are you? GEORGE  No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.  JERRY  Why don't you rent the movie? GEORGE  'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)  KRAMER  So...how was the dinner last night?  JERRY  Oh...well... KRAMER  Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.  ELAINE  Oh...well... KRAMER  Alright, what did you do to Poppie?  ELAINE  Nothing. KRAMER  Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.  ELAINE  What's wrong with him? KRAMER  I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)  JERRY  We should get him something. ELAINE  Yeah. You're right.  Elaine and Carl sitting in carl's moving van after a date. ELAINE  Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?  CARL  Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.  ELAINE  You don't have any furniture? CARL  No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)  ELAINE  Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?  CARL  Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)   Kramer visiting Poppie at the hospital. There sitting on a bench outside.  KRAMER  Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.  POPPIE  What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!  KRAMER  Why, what...? POPPIE  Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?  KRAMER  Well, we're not very close. POPPIE  They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.  KRAMER  Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?  POPPIE  Oh, very good ducks.  Elaine shows up at Jerry's apartment. Jerry opens the door.  ELAINE  I'm in looove! JERRY  Whoa! ELAINE  This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!  JERRY  Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?  ELAINE  No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)  JERRY  No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?  ELAINE  Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.  JERRY  Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?  ELAINE  What? JERRY  What is his stand...on abortion? ELAINE  Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice. JERRY  How do you know? ELAINE  Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.  JERRY  Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.   George at a video store counter. GEORGE  I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.  CLERK  Uh, this is out. Someone has it. GEORGE  Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.  CLERK  Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.  GEORGE  Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.  CLERK  Oh, sorry. We can't do that. GEORGE  Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.  CLERK  I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.   (The clerk goes to help another customer, and leaves George unattended. George waits until the clerk's back is turned, then has a good look at the information on his computer monitor.)   Commercial break.  George at the address of the people who have rented Breakfast At Tiffany's. He's buzzed their apartment on the intercom.  VOICE ON INTERCOM  Yes? GEORGE  Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?  INTERCOM  Yes. GEORGE  Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?   Jerry laying on his new couch. Kramer enters. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey, what's happenin.' KRAMER  Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.  JERRY  You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.  KRAMER  Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)  JERRY  Okay. Hi, Poppie. POPPIE  Hello. JERRY  I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.  POPPIE  That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.  JERRY  Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)  KRAMER  Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?  POPPIE  No. KRAMER  Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?  POPPIE  Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -  JERRY  Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...  POPPIE  The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.)  JERRY  ...the...the... KRAMER  So long. I'll see you tonight. JERRY  Kramer, Kramer, what is this?! KRAMER  What is what? JERRY  This puddle on my sofa! KRAMER  What puddle? JERRY  That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)  KRAMER  I don't know. JERRY  Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!  KRAMER  Are you sure? JERRY  Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!  KRAMER  I'm sure it'll come out. JERRY  I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!  KRAMER  Ah, you're making too much of it. JERRY  Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.  KRAMER  Right!  George at Joe Temple's door. GEORGE  Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.  JOE  Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.  GEORGE  She was a delicate flower. JOE  Why didn't you just read the book?  GEORGE  Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)  JOE  Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us? (George smiles at Remy. Remy looks at Joe doubtfully.)   Elaine climbs into the cab of Carl's moving van. CARL  Hi. ELAINE  Hi. (They kiss.) CARL  I missed you. ELAINE  Oh, I missed you! CARL  I don't remember the last time I felt this way.  ELAINE  Me, either! CARL  I think about you all the time. ELAINE  You do? CARL  Do you think about me? ELAINE  Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.  CARL  What friend? ELAINE  Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)  CARL  You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.   (Elaine breaks down in tears.)  George sitting on Joe's couch, about to watch Breakfast At Tiffany's with Joe and Remy.  GEORGE  So, anything to uh, nosh? JOE  What did you want? GEORGE  Popcorn? REMY  Popcorn? Where do you think you are?  GEORGE  Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.  REMY  Well, we don't. GEORGE  You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.  JOE  Here's some nuts. GEORGE  Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.  REMY  Can we watch the movie now, Daddy? (Joe presses play on the remote.)  GEORGE  Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'  JOE  The lights are fine. (George shrugs, and the movie begins.)   Kramer and Poppie in the kitchen of the restaurant, making the first 'test pizza.'  KRAMER  See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)  POPPIE  Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!  KRAMER  Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...  POPPIE  Not too much! KRAMER  And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)  POPPIE  Wait a second...what is that? KRAMER  It's cucumbers. POPPIE  No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.  KRAMER  Well, why not? I like cucumbers. POPPIE  That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.  KRAMER  But that's the idea, you make your own pie.  POPPIE  Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!  KRAMER  What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?  POPPIE  Because it's a pizza! KRAMER  It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!  POPPIE  It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!  KRAMER  No, it isn't! POPPIE  Yes, it is!  Cut back to George, Joe and Remy watching the movie. Joe's wife enters.  JOE'S WIFE  I'm home. JOE  Hey, honey. REMY  Hi, Mom. JOE'S WIFE  Hi, baby. (To George.) Hello. Breakfast At Tiffany's?  JOE  Yeah. JOE'S WIFE  Well, I just came back from Angela's, it's not looking very good for Duncan.  JOE  Aw, that's too bad. JOE'S WIFE  Yeah, the doctor thinks it's just a matter of time -  GEORGE  Joe...could you... JOE'S WIFE  Poor guy, I hate to see him suffer like this...  GEORGE  You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.  JOE'S WIFE  Who are you? JOE  This is George Costanza. GEORGE  This is very hard to follow with all the talking.  JOE  I'll pause it, okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.)  GEORGE  Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)  JOE'S WIFE  Who is this guy? REMY  He's in some book club. JOE'S WIFE  And what's he doing here? REMY  Cheating on his test. (George returns from the kitchen with a glass of grape juice.)  GEORGE  So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.  REMY  What? GEORGE  C'mon, you took my seat. REMY  It's not your seat. GEORGE  I was sitting there, c'mon. REMY  You didn't save it. GEORGE  I had the arm! Joe... JOE  What's the difference? GEORGE  Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...  REMY  It's my couch. GEORGE  Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)  REMY  Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch, you've ruined our couch! (Joe slowly walks toward George with his hands on his hips.)  GEORGE  Joe...  Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment the next day, looking at the \"Poppie-stain\" on Jerry's sofa.  ELAINE  Oh my god. JERRY  You see?! ELAINE  So, you're gonna get a new couch? JERRY  Well, I guess I have no choice. ELAINE  Do you want your old couch back? JERRY  I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?  INTERCOM  It's the movers. JERRY  'Kay. (Buzzes them in.) ELAINE  Who's that? JERRY  Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.  ELAINE  No, no, he's not my boyfriend. JERRY  Why? ELAINE  Take a guess. JERRY  Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)  ELAINE  Hi. CARL  Hi. JERRY  Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.  CARL  Today? JERRY  Could you? CARL  Sure. ELAINE  What are you doing with this couch?  JERRY  George is taking it. ELAINE  Did you tell him it was peed on? JERRY  He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.   Elaine and Carl in Elaine's kitchen. CARL  I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.  ELAINE  Yeah, me too. CARL  It's just too bad. ELAINE  Yeah. It is. CARL  Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.  ELAINE  Can I offer you anything to drink?  CARL  Yeah, sure. ELAINE  All I've got is grape juice. CARL  Throw it!  (Elaine heaves the grape juice bottle over-hand at Carl, and we hear the sound of breaking glass.)  CARL  The couch!  Commercial break.  George sitting in with the book club around a back booth at Monk's.  MARIE  She didn't want the constraints of any relationship, that's why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence.  GEORGE  Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.  MARIE  George...Fred's gay.  (George ponders this quizzically.)   THE END>",

You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? \"Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!\"   (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" thing.  GEORGE  I think she finds my stupidity charming.  JERRY  As we all do. GEORGE  Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.  JERRY  Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?  GEORGE  Yeah, I'll zip in, \"How do you do?\", zip out. She'll love me.  JERRY  You're good with the mothers. GEORGE  Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.  JERRY  Maybe you should date the mothers.  GEORGE  Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.  JERRY  Oh, you got something goin'. GEORGE  Yeah. KRAMER  (enters apartment) Hey. GEORGE  Hey! (heads toward bathroom) KRAMER  Hey, you got a hammer? JERRY  What do you need a hammer for? KRAMER  Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.  JERRY  Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.  KRAMER  No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?  JERRY  Nah, I don't think so. KRAMER  (shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?  GEORGE  (inside bathroom) Nah. KRAMER  Oh, COME ON! JERRY  Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?  KRAMER  All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)  JERRY  Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?  KRAMER  A gymnast! JERRY  Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.  KRAMER  A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.  JERRY  Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing. KRAMER  (shuts door) \"Bailing\"? JERRY  Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.  KRAMER  Jerry, you should pay that price. JERRY  She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?  KRAMER  Ch- oo-... what? GEORGE  (emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.  JERRY  (watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?  GEORGE  What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.  JERRY  (stares at George, incredulous) \"Back on\"? What was it doing off?  GEORGE  I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the \"office\".  JERRY  (laughing) What for? GEORGE  Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.  JERRY  Unbuttoned, or all the way off? GEORGE  ALL the way, baby! JERRY  Of course. KRAMER  (convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa. JERRY  What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.  KRAMER  (exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...  JERRY  (picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?  GEORGE  Always. JERRY  Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.   (Mr. Pitt's office) MR. PITT  Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.  ELAINE  What meeting? MR. PITT  I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.  ELAINE  Oh! (tries to take paper) MR. PITT  (pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?  ELAINE  Yes? MR. PITT  They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.  ELAINE  All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.   (knock at door) KRAMER  Elaine? ELAINE  Come in, come in! KRAMER  Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?  ELAINE  Ah, right there, yeah. KRAMER  (rips open package) Yeah, that's...  ELAINE  Kramer, it's... KRAMER  (holds up framed picture): There she blows! (throws paper around)  ELAINE  Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?  KRAMER  Oh, these are nice corners, huh? MR. PITT  Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.  KRAMER  (looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.  MR. PITT  Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?  KRAMER  Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!  MR. PITT  I don't see it. KRAMER  Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...  MR. PITT  I still don't see it. ELAINE  Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.  KRAMER  Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.  MR. PITT  A spaceship, where? KRAMER  (pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!  ELAINE  Kramer, what's wrong? KRAMER  Mama! ELAINE  Kramer, Kramer, are you okay? KRAMER  I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!  MR. PITT  (still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?   (Lindsay's mother's apartment)  (Lindsay's relatives are laughing, and George has apparently been witty and charming)  MRS. ENRIGHT  Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.  LINDSAY  Mother... GEORGE  Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.  MRS. ENRIGHT  Oh? Are you and your family close?  GEORGE  (hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.  LINDSAY  Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?  GEORGE  Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?  MRS. ENRIGHT  Can I offer you anything to eat? GEORGE  Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?  MRS. ENRIGHT  Oh no, George, you don't have to...  GEORGE  No, I know I don't have to, I want to.  MRS. ENRIGHT  George, you are such a gentleman. GEORGE  I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.   (Kitchen)  (George opens trash bin, sees an éclair at the top with one bite taken out of it. After looking around to make sure no one is watching, he picks up the éclair and takes a bite just as Mrs. Enright enters the kitchen.)  MRS. ENRIGHT  (wide-eyed) Oh... GEORGE  (spits out mouthful of food): Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!   (Mr. Pitt's office) ELAINE  (pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!  MR. PITT  Where is it? ELAINE  (pointing) Right here. MR. PITT  I'm looking there! ELAINE  No, no, unfocus. MR. PITT  I am unfocused!  (phone rings) ELAINE  (answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.  MR. PITT  (still staring at picture) Meeting?  ELAINE  Yeah, the Poland Creek merger? MR. PITT  Why don't you go for me? ELAINE  How can I go? MR. PITT  Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.  ELAINE  Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.  MR. PITT  Oh, DAMN this thing!  (Jerry's car) JERRY  (trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.  KATYA  Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.  JERRY  He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. \"I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!\"  KATYA  And you could not refuse. JERRY  No, you'd have to be crazy. KATYA  He was a very bad dictator. JERRY  Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.  (Monk's Diner) JERRY  So lemme get this straight: you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an éclair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, \"What the hell, I'll just eat some trash.\"  GEORGE  No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!  JERRY  Was it in the trash? GEORGE  Yes. JERRY  Then it was trash. GEORGE  It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.  JERRY  But it was in the cylinder! GEORGE  Above the rim. JERRY  Adjacent to refuse, is refuse. GEORGE  It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.  JERRY  Was it eaten? GEORGE  One little bite. JERRY  Well, that's garbage. GEORGE  But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!  JERRY  Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.   (Kramer enters, walking awkwardly) JERRY  Hey! KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  What's with you? KRAMER  I got a stone. JERRY  What stone? KRAMER  A kidney stone. JERRY  What is that, anyway? KRAMER  It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!  JERRY  Oh, that's gotta hurt.  (Poland Creek office) ARONSON  Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.  ELAINE  Ah. The \"stock swap\". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)  BECK  And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring.  ELAINE  All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?  BECK  Moland Spring. ELAINE  (making a face) \"Moland\"? ARONSON  Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.  ELAINE  Yeah, I know, but... \"Moland\"? I wouldn't drink anything called \"Moland\".  ARONSON  But it was Mr. Pitt's idea. ELAINE  Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?  ARONSON  (to Beck) We've got to do something about that name.   (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  (on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.  JERRY  Good for you. GEORGE  Yes, good for me! JERRY  Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.  GEORGE  Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!  KRAMER  (enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)  JERRY  Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.  KRAMER  Jerry, what is your problem? JERRY  Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.  KRAMER  All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?  JERRY  No. KRAMER  Tantric yoga? JERRY  No. KRAMER  Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!  JERRY  Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.  KRAMER  All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)  JERRY  All right. GEORGE  Did you pass your stone yet? KRAMER  Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.  JERRY  (pointing at TV) Hey, that's her! KRAMER  Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.   (Jerry's car, night) JERRY  (smiling and excited) Well, here we are.  KATYA  Yes. We are here. JERRY  How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!  KATYA  I can balance myself in any position.   (Jerry swallows) KATYA  It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.  JERRY  Oh boy...  (Jerry's apartment, morning) JERRY  I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a \"magical world\" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.  ELAINE  Well, what did you think she was gonna do?  JERRY  Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.  ELAINE  No, what? JERRY  Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...  ELAINE  What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...  JERRY  You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...  ELAINE  Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?  JERRY  Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.  KRAMER  You mean like the uneven parallel bars?  JERRY  See, again, I really don't feel that...  ELAINE  The balance beam? JERRY  Could we stop? ELAINE  (gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?  JERRY  All right. Let's just drop it.  (Jerry and Elaine move to couch) JERRY  So lemme ask you this: how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.  ELAINE  I dunno, at least three weeks. JERRY  (sarcastic) Oh, great. ELAINE  Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.  JERRY  Between Poland and Morgan? ELAINE  Yeah. Started a big name controversy.   (Kramer shouts from off-screen) JERRY  Kramer! The stone!  (Jerry and Elaine rush to Kramer's apartment, stand in doorway)  JERRY  What happened, did you pass the stone?  KRAMER  (Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.   (City street) GEORGE  (singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) \"...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie...\" (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)  MAN IN CAR  Hey! What the hell was that?! GEORGE  I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-  MAN IN CAR  Clean that up! GEORGE  Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.  MRS. ENRIGHT  (sees George cleaning car windshield, looks appalled)  GEORGE  Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!   (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  (on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)  JERRY  Strike two! GEORGE  You think I'm going down? JERRY  You're behind in the count. GEORGE  I know. KRAMER  (enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?  JERRY  I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.  KRAMER  Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time: people are a little shy, a little reticent.  JERRY  If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.  KRAMER  All right, where you going? JERRY  We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.  KRAMER  Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.  JERRY  Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!  KRAMER  No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.  JERRY  Yeah, well you're going. KRAMER  Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!  (Mr. Pitt's office) MR. PITT  (in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.  ELAINE  Well, I couldn't help it. \"Moland Spring\"?  MR. PITT  I like the name \"Moland\". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!  ELAINE  Well, I'm so sorry! I- MR. PITT  Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?  ELAINE  Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?  MR. PITT  (walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!   (Circus, backstage)  (Clowns rush by Jerry and Kramer, Kramer flinches in fear) KATYA  So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?  JERRY  \"Greatest Show on Earth\"! KATYA  My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.  JERRY  Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.   (Katya's friend walks up) KATYA  Ah, Misha! MISHA  Katya! KATYA  Misha, this is Jerry. MISHA  Ah, yes. The \"co-me-dian\", eh? (speaks in Romanian to Katya)  KATYA  (laughs, replies in Romanian while pointing at Jerry)   (Mr. Pitt's office) ELAINE  (on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!  MR. PITT  (staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!  ELAINE  Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!  MR. PITT  You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!  ELAINE  (on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!  MR. PITT  I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?  ELAINE  (grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!  MR. PITT  Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?  ELAINE  In about twenty minutes. MR. PITT  Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an \"Adolph Hitler\"-style moustache) Do I have time to change?  ELAINE  Um, no. MR. PITT  Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.  ELAINE  Uh, Mr. Pitt... MR. PITT  Yes? ELAINE  Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)  MR. PITT  (sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?  ELAINE  No?  (Pitt exits)  (George's car) GEORGE  Well, here we are. LINDSAY  Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.  GEORGE  Maybe I could just use the bathroom.  LINDSAY  Sure.  (Circus, back stage) ANNOUNCER  (voiceover) Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb.  MISHA  It is time. JERRY  Well, break a leg.  (Misha gives Jerry a dark look) JERRY  Eh, show biz... ANNOUNCER  Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!   (Misha exits) JERRY  Boy, those capes are really coming back.   (Lindsay's mother's apartment) PARTY GUEST  (exits bathroom, finds George waiting) Oh, sorry I took so long. They've got one of those 3-D art posters in there. (wipes eyes) It's mesmerizing.   (George enters bathroom)  (Circus)  (Kramer repeatedly convulses in pain, spilling popcorn and food everywhere, enters Men's room)   (Misha walks slowly across tightrope)  (Long scream bellows forth from Men's room, causing other occupant to flee and Misha to wobble)   (Circus, back stage) JERRY  What is that sound? KATYA  (covering ears) It is horrible!  (Shots of various circus performers reacting to the reverberating scream. Misha falls off the tightrope as audience gasps in horror)   (Lindsay's mother's apartment)  (George emerges from bathroom, shirtless and rubbing eyes) GEORGE  Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!   (George looks around and sees all the party guests staring at him, then realizes he's shirtless. Tries to act casual)   (Morgan Springs shareholder meeting)  (Mr. Pitt stands at a podium, and still has the small black \"ink moustache\". He speaks harshly and with conviction, gesturing emphatically.)  MR. PITT  I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)   (Circus, back stage) KATYA  He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want you to come with me.  JERRY  Oh, why not? KATYA  It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in.  JERRY  Really? KATYA  In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the \"Comedian\". You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian. (walks off)   (Circus, Men's room)  (Kramer walks out, jubilant and whistling)   THE END>",

        "text": "          THE MOM AND POP STORE Written by        Tom Gammill &amp; Max Pross   (Comedy club) JERRY  I like the names they have for cars. Like, no baron has ever owned a LeBaron. Or the Ford LTD. \"LTD.\" Limited. It's a \"limited\" edition...what did they make, fifty million of those? \"Yes, it's 'limited' to the number we can sell.\" Or when they try and mangle a positive word into a car name, you know how they'll do that? The \"Integra.\" Oh, integrity? No, Integra. The \"Supra.\" Or the \"Impreza.\" Yeah? Well, I hope it's not a \"lemona\"...or you'll be hearing from my \"lawya.\"   (George looking at cars at a used car lot, checking out an '89 Volvo.)  CAR SALESMAN  George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?  GEORGE  I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.  SALESMAN  I got a LeBaron convertible right here.  GEORGE  N.I. Not interested. SALESMAN  It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight.  GEORGE  Jon Voight?  Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone with Tim Whatley.  JERRY  Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)  ELAINE  Was that Tim Whatley? JERRY  Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?  ELAINE  I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)  JERRY  Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.  ELAINE  Why? JERRY  He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)  JERRY  Uh - new car! ELAINE  Ohhh!  Mark's Michelle is a dog. JERRY  Hey! Did you get the Volvo? GEORGE  No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.  ELAINE  A LeBaron? JERRY  I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.  GEORGE  What Consumer? I'm the consumer. JERRY  Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.  GEORGE  Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.  ELAINE  Jon Voight? The actor? GEORGE  That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.  JERRY  You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?  GEORGE  No, no... JERRY  I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.  GEORGE  Alright, maybe I do. So what. ELAINE  I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)  KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.  ELAINE  I like coffee. GEORGE  I like (imitates Kramer) \"cookies.\"  KRAMER  Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.  GEORGE  Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.  KRAMER  Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'  JERRY  I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.  KRAMER  Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.  JERRY  Alright, take 'em. KRAMER  Yeah-yah.  Kramer dropping off a box full of Jerry's sneakers at Mom and Pop's shoe repair shop.  POP  Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business.  KRAMER  Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.  MOM  So many sneakers! KRAMER  Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.  POP  They'll be ready a week from Thursday.  KRAMER  Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.  MOM  What's the matter? KRAMER  Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.  MOM  Oh, lie down, and put your head back.  KRAMER  Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)  POP  What? KRAMER  Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.  POP  You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever called an electrician.  KRAMER  Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.   Elaine at Mr. Pitt's, listening to big band music on the radio. Mr. Pitt enters.  MR. PITT  Elaine? ELAINE  Yes, Mr. Pitt? MR. PITT  Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?  ELAINE  No, I'm still working on it. MR. PITT  What in blazes are you listening to?  ELAINE  Artie Shaw. \"Honeysuckle Jump.\" (The song ends.)  DJ ON RADIO  That was Artie Shaw, \"Honeysuckle Jump.\"  MR. PITT  Elaine! How did you know that? ELAINE  Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.  DJ ON RADIO  Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Mr. Pitt hears this and is intrigued; mouths the words \"Woody Woodpecker.\") There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker.  MR. PITT  Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?  ELAINE  Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?  MR. PITT  My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.  ELAINE  Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)  DJ ON RADIO  Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND. (The music starts. Elaine listens intently.)  MR. PITT  Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?  ELAINE  Will you shut up? I can't hear! MR. PITT  I'm sorry! ELAINE  Oh! I've got it! It's \"Next Stop Pottersville\"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)  MR. PITT  Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!   Jerry and George walking down the street toward George's new car.  GEORGE  You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.  JERRY  I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.  GEORGE  What do you mean \"might\"? You don't think he really owned this car?  JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?  JERRY  Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.  GEORGE  Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)  JERRY  Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.  GEORGE  Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.  JERRY  Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)  GEORGE  Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.   Cut to Jerry and George coming back to Jerry's apartment. Jerry tosses his gummy sneakers on the floor.  JERRY  Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)  GEORGE  Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...  JERRY  Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?  KRAMER  You said take 'em. JERRY  Not all of 'em! KRAMER  Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.  JERRY  Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?  KRAMER  Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.  JERRY  I can't wear these! KRAMER  Well, why not? JERRY  They're uncomfortable. KRAMER  C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)  GEORGE  Where did you get those? JERRY  I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!  KRAMER  Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh? JERRY  But I don't wanna be a cowboy! KRAMER  Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.  GEORGE  Yeah, I got one too. KRAMER  Yeah? JERRY  Oh yeah? Huh. GEORGE  What? JERRY  No, nothing. GEORGE  No, what is it? JERRY  No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.  GEORGE  You didn't get one? JERRY  Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.  KRAMER  Not necessarily. JERRY  Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?  GEORGE  That's the genius of it. JERRY  I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.  GEORGE  Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.)  KRAMER  Boss!  Mom and Pop talking to the electrician about the faulty wiring in the ceiling of the shop.  POP  Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!  ELECTRICIAN  Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.  POP  But what if we can't pay for it? ELECTRICIAN  Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry. (Exits.)  POP  48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose! (Kramer enters.)  KRAMER  Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.   (Pop glares at Kramer angrily.)  George and Jerry driving along in John Voight's car. George is humming the tune to \"Everybody's Talkin.'\"  GEORGE  So? JERRY  C'mon, put the top up, it's November!  GEORGE  I feel alive, Jerry. JERRY  Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.  GEORGE  Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!  JERRY  With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.  GEORGE  Ah! See? I told ya. JERRY  Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.  GEORGE  So? JERRY  Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?  GEORGE  So, what are you saying? JERRY  Nothing. I'm sure \"Jon\" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)  GEORGE  Get out of the car! JERRY  What? GEORGE  That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!  JERRY  Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!  GEORGE  Get out! JERRY  And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!  GEORGE  Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)  TOUGH GUY  Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse? (Jerry slips and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.) Yeah, you better run!   Commercial break.  Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment. GEORGE  Did they take anything? JERRY  No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.  GEORGE  Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.  JERRY  You really seemed to enjoy it. GEORGE  It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.  JERRY  Yeah, that's possible. GEORGE  How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.  JERRY  He'll dispose of it. GEORGE  Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)  ELAINE  So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.  JERRY  Ah! What'd you find out, Lois? ELAINE  Well, I talked to Tim Whatley... JERRY  Yeah... ELAINE  And I asked him, \"Should Jerry bring anything?\"  JERRY  So...? ELAINE  Mmmm...and he said, \"Why would Jerry bring anything?\"  JERRY  Alright, but let me ask you this question.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, \"Why would Jerry bring anything?\" or, \"Why would Jerry bring anything?\" You emphasize \"Jerry\" or \"bring.\"  ELAINE  I think he emphasized \"would.\" JERRY  You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)  KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey, so where's my sneakers? KRAMER  That's what I wanna know. JERRY  What do you mean? KRAMER  Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.  JERRY  So all my sneakers are gone? KRAMER  I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.  JERRY  Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!  KRAMER  It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.  ELAINE  So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.  KRAMER  Apparently. ELAINE  Alright, that's enough of this. JERRY  Where ya goin'? ELAINE  I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.  JERRY  Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?  ELAINE  He finds his laugh \"intoxicating.\" (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)   George in a meeting at Yankee stadium. MR. MORGAN  So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?  GEORGE  Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.  MR. MORGAN  Jon Voight? The actor? (Rubs his eyes wearily.) Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza.  GEORGE  I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.   Elaine at the Dixieland Deli, seated at a table with the other contest winners.  CONTEST WINNER  I guessed Stan Herman's \"Boomtown Blues.\" What'd you guess?  ELAINE  Um, it was, uh...\"Next Stop Pottersville.\" (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?  CONTEST WINNER  After the music. (The band starts playing directly behind Elaine. She is deafened by the loudness of the horns.)   Kramer walking down the street. His nose starts to bleed. KRAMER  Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)  VOIGHT  Taxi! (Walks right by Kramer.) Taxi.  KRAMER  Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)   Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. JERRY  No Jon Voight Day, huh? GEORGE  No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?  JERRY  Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.  GEORGE  You should have somebody take a look at that.  JERRY  I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.  GEORGE  You going to the party? JERRY  No, I don't know if I'm invited. GEORGE  Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.  JERRY  Yeah, you're right. GEORGE  You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.  JERRY  Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.  GEORGE  Maybe I'll just meet you there. JERRY  You don't want to go with me? GEORGE  Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?  JERRY  The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?  KRAMER  No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?  GEORGE  Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?  KRAMER  Well, he was a little standoffish.  GEORGE  What, you didn't ask him about the car?  KRAMER  No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.  JERRY  What? KRAMER  His tooth marks. He bit me. GEORGE  Jon Voight bit you? JERRY  Well, what is he, a vampire? KRAMER  No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.  GEORGE  He left perfect imprints. KRAMER  That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!  JERRY  Oh, please. GEORGE  Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.  JERRY  No, it's stupid. GEORGE  Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.  JERRY  So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.  GEORGE  It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)  JERRY  So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?  KRAMER  Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.   Tim Whatley's party. Jerry peeks his head around the corner, then slowly moves through the crowd, covering his face to keep a low profile.  JERRY  Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?   Cut to George and Kramer looking at the parade out the window.  GEORGE  These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.  KRAMER  You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?  GEORGE  Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?  KRAMER  That's right. He's a troublemaker.   (Elaine enters the party with a trophy under her arm, and runs into Jerry.)  JERRY  Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?  ELAINE  What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?  JERRY  What is that, the Empire State Building?  ELAINE  What? I can't hear you. JERRY  Elaine, would you marry me? ELAINE  I told you, I can't hear a word. JERRY  Alright. Forget it.  (Tim gets up from the couch and meets George and Kramer.) GEORGE  Hey, Tim. TIM  Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)  GEORGE  Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.  TIM  No, it's no problem, what is it? GEORGE  Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)  GUY  Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.' TIM  Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?  KRAMER  He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)  GEORGE  Uh, Tim, the pencil... TIM  Jerry. JERRY  Hey, Tim. TIM  Jerry. I didn't think you'd show. JERRY  Did you say, \"Jerry, I didn't think you'd show\" or, \"Jerry, I didn't think you'd show\"? (Elaine comes over.)  TIM  Elaine! Hi! ELAINE  Tim. TIM  Well. I'm really glad you came. ELAINE  What? TIM  Really glad you came. ELAINE  Uh huh. TIM  Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.  ELAINE  What? What?  (Cut to George and Kramer talking to another dentist at the party.)  GEORGE  Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?  DENTIST  It's possible. GEORGE  Roll up your sleeve. DENTIST  Somebody bit you? KRAMER  Not just someone. Jon Voight. DENTIST  Jon Voight bit you? (George notices Tim across the room with the pencil in his mouth.) The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks!  TIM  That's John Voight's pencil? GEORGE  That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.  TIM  Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?  GEORGE  Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!  TIM  Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.  GEORGE  Jon Voight, the actor? TIM  No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.)   (Cut to Jerry by the window, getting one of the dentists at the party to look at his chipped tooth.)  DENTIST  Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.  JERRY  Just a quick peek. I'm in agony. DENTIST  Alright. Sit down. JERRY  It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)  KRAMER  Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker! TIM  Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)   Jerry and Kramer in Jerry's apartment, watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on TV.  ANNOUNCER ON TV  Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact, he's collapsing.  KRAMER  Those kids look pretty disappointed.  JERRY  Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?  GUY ON PHONE  Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld? JERRY  Yes it is. GUY ON PHONE  You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened. I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.  JERRY  Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!  KRAMER  Where are they? JERRY  Parsippany, New Jersey. KRAMER  Let's go! JERRY  My car's in the shop. KRAMER  Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?   (Cut to Jerry and Kramer sitting in the back of a Trailways bus, en route to Parsippany. Kramer's nose starts to bleed again.)  KRAMER  Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.  JERRY  Maybe we should get you to a hospital.  KRAMER  Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.  THE END>",

JERRY  Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?  SHEILA  You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.  JERRY  You're a shmoopy! SHEILA  You're a shmoopy! JERRY  You're a shmoopy! GEORGE  All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.  JERRY  Uh..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?  SHEILA  No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.  GEORGE  Hey. ELAINE  Hey. SHEILA  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  Hi Sheila. JERRY  All right, then. I'll see you later.  SHEILA  Bye shmoopy. JERRY  Bye shmoopy. ELAINE  Okay. We ready to go? GEORGE  Yes. Please. Please, let's go. ELAINE  Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.  JERRY  No. We gotta go to the soup place.  ELAINE  What soup place? GEORGE  Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.  JERRY  He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.  ELAINE  Stunned by soup? JERRY  You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.  ELAINE  Huh. All right. Come on. JERRY  There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.  ELAINE  Why? What happens if you don't order right?  JERRY  He yells and you don't get your soup.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.  GEORGE  All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.  JERRY  All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  The main thing is to keep the line moving.  GEORGE  All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.  JERRY  Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.  ELAINE  Oh, boy, I'm really scared! JERRY  Elaine. ELAINE  All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.  JERRY  Ar-moire. ELAINE  How much is this? FURNITURE GUY  I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.  ELAINE  Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.  JERRY  He gave you the nice face discount.  ELAINE  Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.  JERRY  What about the soup? ELAINE  I'm getting an armoire, Jerry. JERRY  (in French accent) Pardon. GEORGE  This line is huge. JERRY  It's like this all the time. GEORGE  Isn't that that Bania guy? JERRY  Oh, no. It is. Just be still. GEORGE  Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.  BANIA  Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.  JERRY  Hard to believe. BANIA  This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.  JERRY  Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.  BANIA  Why not? JERRY  Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.  BANIA  Okay. Okay. GEORGE  Medium turkey chili. JERRY  Medium crab bisque. GEORGE  I didn't get any bread. JERRY  Just forget it. Let it go. GEORGE  Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.  SOUP NAZI  Bread -- $2 extra. GEORGE  $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.  SOUP NAZI  You want bread? GEORGE  Yes, please. SOUP NAZI  $3! GEORGE  What? SOUP NAZI  No soup for you! (snaps fingers)  (cashier takes George's soup and gives him back his money) ELAINE  What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.  SUPER  It's Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule.  ELAINE  But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.  SUPER  Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right?  ELAINE  Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.  FURNITURE GUY  I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.  ELAINE  Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.  JERRY  Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?  GEORGE  You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?  JERRY  I gave you a taste. What do you want?  GEORGE  Why can't we share? JERRY  I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!  GEORGE  Do you hear yourself? JERRY  I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.  GEORGE  Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.  SHEILA  Hi. Hi shmoopy. JERRY  Hi shmoopy. SHEILA  No, you're a shmoopy! JERRY  You're a shmoopy! GEORGE  I'm going. JERRY  Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?  GEORGE  You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  I just don't feel like it anymore.  JERRY  Just like that? GEORGE  Just like that. SHEILA  Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he? KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  (taking Jerry's couch cushion) Yeah.  JERRY  Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?  KRAMER  Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all   night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.  JERRY  Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.  KRAMER  Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!  ELAINE  Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.  KRAMER  Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.  ELAINE  Do you need anything? KRAMER  Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.  ELAINE  Mulligatawny? KRAMER  Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of   the great soup artisans  in the modern era. ELAINE  Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi? KRAMER  He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most   geniuses are. ELAINE  All right. I'll be back. KRAMER  Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.  ELAINE  Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it. KRAMER  No. No, Elaine! ELAINE  Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?  GEORGE  No. I didn't get it. ELAINE  Why? What happened? GEORGE  I made a mistake. ELAINE  (laughing) GEORGE  All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.  ELAINE  Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of   there with a bowl of soup. GEORGE  Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you   find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl? ELAINE  Oh, I know! It is awful! GEORGE  Why do they have to do that in front of people?  ELAINE  I don't know. GEORGE  What is that with the shmoopy? ELAINE  Ohh! GEORGE  The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!  ELAINE  Ohh! Stop it! I know. GEORGE  I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is   actually called shmoopy. ELAINE  Ugh! GEORGE  And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.  ELAINE  You know, we should say something.  GEORGE  You know, we absolutely should. ELAINE  I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff   that is? GEORGE  I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.  ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  I still haven't figured him out. ELAINE  No. Me neither. GEORGE  All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.  ELAINE  Oh, God! GEORGE  Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.  SOUP NAZI  You're pushing your luck little man.  GEORGE  Sorry. Thank you. ELAINE  Hi there. Um, uh -- (drumming on countertop) Oh! Oh! Oh! One   mulligatawny and, um....  what is that right there? Is that lima bean? SOUP NAZI  Yes. ELAINE  Never been a big fan. (coughing) Um..you know what? Has anyone ever   told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, \" Scent Of A Woman.\"   Who-ah! Who-ah! SOUP NAZI  Very good. Very good. ELAINE  Well, I -- SOUP NAZI  You know something? ELAINE  Hmmm? SOUP NAZI  No soup for you! ELAINE  What? SOUP NAZI  Come back one year! Next! RAY  Look at this. BOB  It's an antique. RAY  It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.  BOB  Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No.   Pick it up from the bottom over there. KRAMER  Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?  BOB  What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.  KRAMER  You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.  BOB  Look, you wanna get hurt? KRAMER  Huh? BOB  I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can   hurt you. Now, just back off. RAY  Bob. BOB  Just pick it up. KRAMER  What is this, huh? BOB  You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding?   We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay? ELAINE  I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna   call the states' attorney office. I really am. GEORGE  Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.  ELAINE  All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit   down. What happened? Where's my armoire? KRAMER  Well, b -- it was stolen. ELAINE  Wha--? KRAMER  These street toughs, they robbed me.  ELAINE  Street toughs took my armoire? KRAMER  Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've   seen the way they talked to me. ELAINE  I can't believe this! KRAMER  Well, where's the soup? ELAINE  Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.  KRAMER  Oh...yeah! JERRY  What are you gonna get? SHEILA  I'll decide at the last minute. JERRY  You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!   (Soup Nazi pounding on countertop) JERRY  Uh-oh. SOUP NAZI  Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in   my line! SHEILA  I can kiss anywhere I want to. SOUP NAZI  You just cost yourself a soup! SHEILA  How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?  JERRY  Do I know you? ELAINE  So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?  JERRY  It was a bisque. ELAINE  Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become   much more normal than you. JERRY  Really? ELAINE  Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married.   Your top priority is soup. JERRY  Have you tastes the soup? ELAINE  Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.  JERRY  See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with   Sheila than with the Soup Nazi. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Hey. KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  Oh, thanks. ELAINE  There he is. KRAMER  Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.  ELAINE  Yeah. I know. Me, too. JERRY  So, did these thieves want any money?  KRAMER  No. JERRY  They just wanted the armoire? KRAMER  Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.   (interom buzzes) JERRY  Yeah? GEORGE  Hup! Hup! JERRY  Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?  ELAINE  No. In what way? JERRY  I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or   something. ELAINE  I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.  GEORGE  Hello. JERRY  Hello. KRAMER  Hey. GEORGE  Hello. ELAINE  Hello. GEORGE  Were you just talking about me? What's going on?  JERRY  Absolutely not. GEORGE  Something's going on here. KRAMER  All right, (claps hands) I'm gonna go get some soup.  ELAINE  One of these days that guy is gonna get his.  GEORGE  So, how was the movie? JERRY  Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.  GEORGE  Oh, yeah? JERRY  Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?  GEORGE  Happy? Why should I be happy? JERRY  I don't know, but you look like you're happy.  GEORGE  Why should I care? JERRY  You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when   you're happy. GEORGE  All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of   you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?   (Elaine sneaks out of Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Is that so? GEORGE  Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy,   shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!  JERRY  Disgusting? GEORGE  People who do that should be arrested.  JERRY  Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.  GEORGE  Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.  JERRY  What? GEORGE  You shook my hand in that coffee shop.  JERRY  You're still with the pact? GEORGE  Mmm-hmm. You reneged. JERRY  All I did was shake your hand. GEORGE  Ah-ha! KRAMER  And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.  SOUP NAZI  Ohh! This city. NEWMAN  One large jambalaya, please. SOUP NAZI  So, continue. KRAMER  Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very   emotional. NEWMAN  Thank you. (inhaling deeply) Jambalaya!  SOUP NAZI  All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have   an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome   to it. So, take it, it's yours. KRAMER  How can I possibly thank you? SOUP NAZI  You are the only one who understands me.  KRAMER  You suffer for your soup. SOUP NAZI  Yes. That is right. KRAMER  You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.  SOUP NAZI  How can I tolerate any less from my customer?  CUSTOMER  Uh, gazpacho, por favor. SOUP NAZI  Por favor? CUSTOMER  Um, I'm part Spanish. SOUP NAZI  Adios muchacho! KRAMER  Git. JERRY  It was stupid of me. SHEILA  Well, it was very insulting. JERRY  No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.  SHEILA  Well, behind every joke there's some truth.  JERRY  What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth   to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States   to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get   there and they don't have it he says \" Aw, I'll just have some   coffee.\" There's no truth to that. SHEILA  Well, I guess you're right. JERRY  So, am I forgiven, shmoopy? SHEILA  Yes, shmoopy. JERRY  Aw! SUSAN  Hey, Jerry! JERRY  Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.  GEORGE  Oh, yes. Hello. SHEILA  Hello. Won't you join us? GEORGE  No, thanks. SUSAN  Of course. GEORGE  Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?  JERRY  Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?  GEORGE  I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one   side...and leave the other side empty. JERRY  Well, we're changing the rules. GEORGE  Ahh. Good for you. SUSAN  Aw, what are you getting George? GEORGE  I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? (in babying voice) I   want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I   want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie? SUSAN  Oh, George, you're so sweet. GEORGE  Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.  SUSAN  Aww! JERRY  What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little   tuna fishy? SHEILA  Yeah. JERRY  Yum yum little tuna fishy? GEORGE  Come here.  (George &amp; Susan begin making out; Jerry &amp; Sheila begin making out in order   to keep up) KRAMER  And..voila! ELAINE  (gasps) KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!  KRAMER  Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?  ELAINE  The K Man did it! KRAMER  Yeah! ELAINE  (laughing) How much did you pay for this thing?  KRAMER  How 'bout zero? ELAINE  What? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?  KRAMER  I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously   refer to as the Soup Nazi. ELAINE  Get out!  (Elaine pushes on Kramer's chest, causing in to fall backwards through her   swinging door) ELAINE  The Soup Nazi gave it to you? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Why? KRAMER  Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha --   Yeah. He's a wonderful man. ELAINE  (gasps) KRAMER  Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....  ELAINE  Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I   mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful! KRAMER  Yeah. Well, he's a dear. GEORGE  How much tip do you leave on $8.15?  SUSAN  You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you   today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all.   Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step   forward in our relationship. GEORGE  Huh? SUSAN  (in babying voice) Because you love your little kiki don't you?  CUSTOMER  How is he today? BANIA  I think he's in a good mood. ELAINE  Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful.   I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it. SOUP NAZI  You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to   him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it   to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up! JERRY  I'm heading over to Elaine's. KRAMER  Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.  JERRY  Those two? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  Are you sure? KRAMER  Yeah. That's them. JERRY  Well, let's confront 'em. KRAMER  No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop. JERRY  There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.  KRAMER  No! JERRY  Let's go. BOB  Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.  RAY  Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.  BOB  Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't   think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.  KRAMER  Excuse me. RAY  Are you talking to me? KRAMER  Uh, well, uh, we -- RAY  I said, are you talking to me? BOB  Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you   was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you   talking to?! KRAMER  Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each   other, weren't we?  (Jerry &amp; Kramer turn around and run away) ELAINE  I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life.   There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi.   What? What is that? JERRY  I don't know. \" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of   olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley...\" ELAINE  Let me see this. (gasps) You know what this is? This is a recipe   for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes.   These are his recipes! JERY  So? ELAINE  So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to   every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could   drop fliers from a plane above the city. JERRY  Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?  ELAINE  What do you care? JERRY  Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup   stand. I happen to love that soup. ELAINE  Get out of my way, Jerry. JERRY  Elaine, let the man make his soup!  ELAINE  Don't make me hurt you, Jerry. SUSAN  Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby   bluey? GEORGE  Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey. JERRY  Well. Well. SUSAN  Hi, Jerry. JERRY  Hey, Susan, George. SUSAN  You know, I really like Sheila a lot.  JERRY  Oh, really? SUSAN  Mmm-hmm. JERRY  Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.  SUSAN  Oh, no! That's too bad. JERRY  Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.  GEORGE  Really? JERRY  Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.  SUSAN  Mmm-hmm. GEORGE  You did? JERRY  Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.  GEORGE  Yeah. See ya. SOUP NAZI  Go on! Leave! Get out! WOMAN  But I didn't do anything. SOUP NAZI  Next! ELAINE  Hello. SOUP NAZI  You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.  ELAINE  I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. \" 5 cups chopped Porcine   mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery.\" SOUP NAZI  That is my recipe for wild mushroom.  ELAINE  Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.  SOUP NAZI  Mulliga...tawny? ELAINE  You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!  NEWMAN  (panting) Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! JERRY  What is it? NEWMAN  Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!  JERRY  Wha - wha - what's the matter? NEWMAN  Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more soup for any of us!  JERRY  Well, where are you going? NEWMAN  He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!  THE END>",

        "text": "   THE SECRETARY Written by     Carol Leifer &amp; Marjorie Gross   (Comedy club)  I don't even know what, what is supposed to be attractive about fur? Why does a man want to see a woman in a fur? Men want women to shave their legs, shave their armpits, pluck their eyebrows and then before we go out, we dress them up like a bear.  To me the only reason to wear fur, would be if you were trying to sneak up on another animal. Did you ever see those tribal hunters where they wear the fur and then they had the other animals, head on top of their head? You know I'm sure there's a moose looking at that going,   Yeah, that looks real good. Yeah, I'm gonna turn my back on this goof ball with the extra head. Because there's nothing fishy going on there.   I'll just keep drinking from the stream. I've seen a lot of two-headed  tigers with knees.  Exterior of a Dry Cleaners -- then inside where Jerry and George are talking, Jerry is holding a few items, waiting to drop them off to be dry cleaned. GEORGE  Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview. JERRY  That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother. GEORGE  Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.  JERRY  From your mother.  (George &amp; Jerry turn and move closer to the counter as a few customers leave the store.) JERRY  So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category? GEORGE  Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. I'll never get any work done. So I'm doing a complete 360. I'm going for total efficiency and ability. JERRY  That's a 180, George. GEORGE  Whatever.  (Jerry turns and walks up to the counter. George wonders about the lobby area) JERRY  Hi Willie. WILLIE  Hey Jerry.  JERRY  I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.  WILLIE  What are you doing with it? JERRY  Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida. DONNA  Hi. JERRY  Hi. WILLIE  Hey Jerry, you know my wife Donna.  JERRY  Yeah, that's why I said hi.  (Donna smiles and walks away) WILLIE  Hey, nice jacket. (looking over the jacket)  JERRY  Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth. WILLIE  Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very flattering. JERRY  Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.   Daylight exterior shot of Yankee Stadium, then to George Costanza's   office where he is interviewing an attractive applicant for his   secretary job. APPLICANT  Well, I type about 90 words a minute. I'm completely well-versed in all IBM and Macintosh programs. GEORGE  (looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience.   But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. I'm looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, I'm afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.   (the camera is now back on the applicant's seat, but another even more attractive woman is seated there) GEORGE  You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. I'm terribly sorry. (both   George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)  (A very plain looking applicant now sits across from george)  ADE  As you can see my references are impeccable. I think I'd be a real asset here. My only concern is, I do take care of my mother. So will there be any late nights? GEORGE  I can't imagine.  Exterior shot of Jerry's apartment, then inside where Elaine is holding a garment bag and talking with Jerry. ELAINE  Ok, So Barney's is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself. JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like I'm carrying twins. JERRY  So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.  ELAINE  Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.  JERRY  I thought we were going to the movies?  ELAINE  All right I'll try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)  (George Enters) GEORGE  Hey hey. ELAINE  Hey George GEORGE  Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) I'm telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didn't have one before. JERRY  Because you didn't have a job? GEORGE  Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade. JERRY  A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.  (Elaine walks back into the living room, modeling the dress, arms extended straight out from her sides, elbows bent, with the look on her face that says, huh ... what do you think? -- She walks towards George and Jerry) JERRY  It's a little ... ELAINE  All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.  JERRY  You got no waist in that thing. GEORGE  You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.  ELAINE  I said, All Right. GEORGE  Well wha'd you buy it for? ELAINE  Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barney's, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal. JERRY  How fast was she walking?  (Elaine heads for the bedroom to change out of the dress, turns and looks at Jerry) GEORGE  Demi? I thought it was Demi? JERRY  No. I think it's Demi. GEORGE  Really? I never heard of a semi tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)  (Elaine walks back in, still in the dress) ELAINE  Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their   respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise) JERRY  What? ELAINE  Skinny Mirrors! Barney's has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter. JERRY  Oh, you're crazy. ELAINE  Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barney's? GEORGE  (to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.  (Kramer enters, seeing Elaine -- his head and upper body lurches   backwards) KRAMER  Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?  ELAINE  Oh I'm returning this dress to Barney's.  KRAMER  Good idea. JERRY  Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.  ELAINE  Yeah yeah, ok. KRAMER  Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.  ELAINE  Moisturizer? That's girls stuff. KRAMER  No no, look. I'll tell you what -- they're having a sale right.  ELAINE  yeah. KRAMER  I'll meetcha down there, well have lunch.  ELAINE  Well we could ... KRAMER  Well, we'll get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)  Daylight exterior shot of Yankee Stadium, then to George Costanza's   office, he stands in front of a wall calendar, as Ade, his new secretary takes down notes as to what George is saying. GEORGE  And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So let's clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.  ADE  Anaheim Hotel. (George picks up a container of chinese food from the credenza) You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods.  GEORGE  Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)  ADE  OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable.  GEORGE  Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient. ADE  Well thank you, I'm flattered. GEORGE  I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.  ADE  Well I'm just, hm, doing my job. GEORGE  It's like I'm thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me. ADE  What can I say? I'm ... I'm good at what I do. (smiling and quietly laughing proudly) GEORGE  (coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what I'm ... thinking about now? ADE  (thinking about the question, she stops writing) Yes, I think I do. (she turns her head slowly and looks directly at him) GEORGE  Is it, uh, doable? ADE  It's definitely doable.  (Ade throws her note pad and pencil in to the air, along with her glasses. George grabs his glasses and takes them from his face and throws them on the couch as he and Ade embrace in a frantic kiss and slither down to the floor between the desk and the couch -- the camera cannot see them on the floor)  Outside a movie theater (The Paragon) Jerry and Elaine have exited the theater and are walking slowly and then stop to talk, as other movie goers leave the theater behind them - in the background, there is a line of people waiting to buy tickets for the next show. JERRY  Well, that was the worst. ELAINE  I can't believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break. MAN  (waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth! ANOTHER MAN  (waiting in line, closer to the box office) Yeah! (in agreement with the other guy)  (Kramer rushes up to Elaine and Jerry) KRAMER  You got a pen? JERRY  Yeah, I think I do. KRAMER  And I need something to write on. JERRY  Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.  KRAMER  I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma. JERRY  Uma Therman? Really? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  How'd you manage that. KRAMER  Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater) JERRY  He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?  ELAINE  Where? JERRY  He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket. ELAINE  What would he be doing wearing your jacket?  JERRY  It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it. ELAINE  Are you sure?  (Kramer walks up, smiling gleefully) KRAMER  I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)  ELAINE  You are amazing. KRAMER  Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)   Exterior shot of Yankee Stadium at dusk and then to George Costanza's   office. (moaning) George and Ade are struggling to kneel and undress while kissing. ADE  Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt. GEORGE  Ade you are incredible  (as he unbuttons her jacket, they fall to the floor again -- the camera cannot see them between the desk and the couch -- we see over George's desk, keyboard, manila folders and then we see Ade's shoe in the air above the desk) ADE  Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me that pillow.  (we see George's head and arm above the desk ridge, he grabs a pillow from the couch and hands it to Ade. Her arm pulls him back down to her on the ground) GEORGE  What? Oh, My God! ADE  Mr. CO STAN ZA! GEORGE  Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... I'm giving you a raise!   Exterior shot of the restaurant (Monks) then inside. George and Jerry are sitting in the normal booth. JERRY  So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out I'm giving you a raise. GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises? GEORGE  Not that I'm aware of, no. JERRY  So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head. GEORGE  I didn't think ahead. JERRY  Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.  GEORGE  I didn't say any other bawdy things.  JERRY  Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.  GEORGE  All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.  (they stand up from their seats at the booth) JERRY  All right, all right. I'm sorry. GEORGE  Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenner's office and tell him he has to give her a raise.  JERRY  How long has she been there? GEORGE  3 days. JERRY  It's almost a week.  (Jerry picks up several items of clothing from the booth, in their dry-cleaning bags -- He is wearing his Hounds-Tooth jacket. George and Jerry walk over to the cash register to pay for lunch. At the register, Jerry reaches into his Hounds-Tooth jacket pocket, he pulls out a movie stub) JERRY  Oh, My god. GEORGE  What? JERRY  It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.  Commercial  Exterior shot of Barney's department store, street scene with store windows. Then inside to Elaine, Kramer and the Barney's sales   associate -- they stand in the women's clothing dept. (Zelda is the name of the clothing line on the wall), outside of the dressing room area. Elaine is wearing the dress she plans on returning. ELAINE  These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.  something else. ELAINE  OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the   direction of the elevator) ELAINE  Ok thanks so much. (the Barney's sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for? KRAMER  Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank. ELAINE  I like your little bag. KRAMER  Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.  ELAINE  Huh.  (Kramer opens the moisturizer and squeezes some onto his palm)  KRAMER  Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.   (Elaine walks away into the dressing from area. Kenny Bania enters the clothing dept.) BANIA  Hey Kramer. KRAMER  Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes) BANIA  I'm looking for a new suit. I can't find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramer's suit) KRAMER  Well, thank you. BANIA  Did you get that here? KRAMER  No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.  BANIA  You're telling me. KRAMER  I sure am. BANIA  It's hard for me to find pants that --  KRAMER  (interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.  BANIA  Yes KRAMER  Me too. BANIA  What size are you? KRAMER  Uh, 42. BANIA  42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, I'm huge. How'd you like to sell it? KRAMER  make me an offer. BANIA  100 Bucks KRAMER  Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania)  BANIA  175 KRAMER  Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship. BANIA  300 dollars. KRAMER  Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.  BANIA  You throw the shirt in? KRAMER  Bania, you're killing me. BANIA  Hey that's the women's dressing room.  KRAMER  There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.   Daylight exterior shot of Yankee Stadium (Louisville Slugger) then to George Steinbrenner's office. The camera is behind Steinbrenner,   looking towards the door. GEORGE  (Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second? STEINBRENNER  Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- I'm a very accessible man. I just wanted to say you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff. GEORGE  Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one. STEINBRENNER  Ade, Ade, I like that name George.  GEORGE  She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)  STEINBRENNER  Is that a fact George? GEORGE  Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards   Steinbrenner's desk) STEINBRENNER  I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass. GEORGE  She can't even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.  STEINBRENNER  What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter? ($2.25)  GEORGE  You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.  (Telephone rings -- Steinbrenner reaches for the receiver) STEINBRENNER  You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. (picks up the telephone hand set) Hello, ah, George will you excuse me.  Daylight exterior shot of Barney's department store windows, with traffic driving by -- then to Elaine in the dressing room -- she is almost done dressing in the Calvin Klein dress.  Kramer climbs up the wall of his dressing room adjacent to Elaine's -- we see his head, top of his bare chest, arm and both hands over the top of Elaine's' dressing room wall -- he is looking down at her.  KRAMER  Psst. Hey.  (Elaine is startled and tries to cover her top, which is mostly covered from the dress she is putting on) ELAINE  Kramer, what are you doing here? KRAMER  Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.  ELAINE  What? KRAMER  Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.  ELAINE  So go buy a new one. KRAMER  What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.  ELAINE  So. KRAMER  Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes. ELAINE  Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)  Exterior shot of the Dry Cleaners store front, then to the interior -- Jerry enters as a female customer is leaving the counter with her dry-cleaning . JERRY  Hello, Willie. WILLIE  Hey, Jerry. You dropping off? JERRY  No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?  WILLIE  You came by to ask that? JERRY  Yeah. Specifically 9:30 shows. Seen any good 9:30 shows at the Paragon, Willie? WILLIE  What are you gettin at? JERRY  I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket. WILLIE  Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaner's code.  JERRY  You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples' clothes  WILLIE  I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things. (he makes the circular motion next to his ears - the international   symbol for insane) JERRY  Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter) WILLIE  Jerry. JERRY  Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- I'll be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.  WILLIE  Jerry, come on. JERRY  Now. WILLIE  Now? (Willie looks off with his eyes to his left -- he is thinking about his wife Donna)  (Shot of Donna wearing the fur coat, standing at a hot dog stand, eating a hot dog) JERRY  Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket) WILLIE  Well ... ahh. (apprehensively) JERRY  Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer. WILLIE  Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the coat? JERRY  No, not on me. WILLIE  Well, I, I need to see that ticket.  JERRY  Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.  WILLIE  Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You can't, get anything without a number. JERRY  All right, I'll be back.  Elaine inside Barney's, she stands in front of a full length mirror. The sales associate behind her, giving advice on the dress.  ELAINE  Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?  ELAINE  I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.  (Elaine looks around, like she is trying not to be noticed and walks out of the clothing dept.)  Daytime exterior of Yankee Stadium, then inside to George Costanza's   office. ADE  I can't thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. I'm so grateful  GEORGE  Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didn't get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right) ADE  It was just so generous. GEORGE  Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her) ADE  Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand.  GEORGE  (spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise. ADE  Yes, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner...  GEORGE  You're making more than I am. ADE  I am? GEORGE  What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss. ADE  Well apparently they can.  Elaine, in the Calvin Klein dress, is walking outside along the   sidewalk, snow along the curb and store fronts -- It's obvious she is cold without a coat. She checks out her reflection in a florist's   window, then stops at the Love, Health &amp; Beauty Aids store, where the reflection is more like a mirror in the alcove of the store.  ELAINE  Oh, this is insanity. I'm not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)  (a man exits the store) ELAINE  Hey, what do you think of this? MAN  (with disbelief): You'll never pull it off.   Barney's Department store, inside the dressing room area, a customer   knocks on the door where Kramer is waiting for Jerry. FEMALE CUSTOMER  Hey, what's going on in there?  (Jerry enters the women's clothing dept.) JERRY  (to the Barney's sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?  (Female customer walks up to the Barney's sales associate that Jerry was just talking to) FEMALE CUSTOMER  This woman has been in there for over an hour.   (The Barney's sales associate walks into the dressing room area and up to the dressing room door where Kramer is waiting for Jerry)  KRAMER  (Yeah) (through the door)  (Jerry hears Kramer and walks into the dressing room door) JERRY  Kramer? KRAMER  Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes? JERRY  What clothes? KRAMER  Didn't Elaine call you? JERRY  No. KRAMER  Well what are you doing here? JERRY  What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.  KRAMER  Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants  JERRY  Where are your pants? KRAMER  Well, I sold them to Bania. JERRY  What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.   (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room. Kramer is standing there in his white boxer shorts and no shirt) JERRY  Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?  KRAMER  ouhhh -- I had Uma Therman's number written on that stub. I lost Uma's number. JERRY  Where are your clothes? KRAMER  I told you I sold them to Bania. JERRY  You mean what you were wearing? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  How'd you expect to get out of here?  KRAMER  Well, I didn't think ahead.  (Elaine reenters the Barney's clothing dept., rubbing her arms because he is cold. The sales associate is also coming back from the dressing rooms. Elaine sees her, and quickly stands next to the register counter and tries to act like she has been there for a while.) ELAINE  This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else. ELAINE  No? ELAINE  I am? ELAINE  Ha! That's preposterous.  snow in the store.  (Elaine looks down and gathers the dress at the salt stain)  ELAINE  No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there? JERRY  (Elaine) ELAINE  Jerry?  (Bania enters the dressing room area) BANIA  Elaine, where's Kramer? KRAMER  Bania? BANIA  Kramer. JERRY  I'm going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside) BANIA  Jerry. JERRY  Bania. BANIA  Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined. KRAMER  Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here. JERRY  (to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)  KRAMER  Uma's number is on that ticket. JERRY  Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit? KRAMER  I'm not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it. JERRY  I got an idea. KRAMER  What? JERRY  I can't believe I'm gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania) JERRY  Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?  BANIA  Pretty good. JERRY  Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, I'm in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants. BANIA  Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket. JERRY  Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner. BANIA  Can we go back to Mendy's? JERRY  You want to go to Mendy's, I'll take you to Mendy's.  BANIA  Twice? I wanna go twice. JERRY  all right let's be reasonable, Bania. I'm taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal. BANIA  Two Mendy's. JERRY  . . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.  BANIA  Here you go. JERRY  Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)   Exterior of yankee Stadium (Louisville Slugger) then to George   Steinbrenner's office. George Costanza stands pleading his case.  GEORGE  But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack. STEINBRENNER  Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies.  (George starts to back away from the desk) STEINBRENNER  I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets.  (George turning around, nodding and making hand gestures, walking slowly towards the door, his hand gestures get progressively wider eventually   to full arms extended upwards) STEINBRENNER  Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just can't even make up my mind. A lot of times I'll mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge.  Jerry stands outside the Barney's dressing room door that Kramer is waiting in. Jerry quickly knocks on the door. JERRY  Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket) KRAMER  (closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Uma's number? The   moisturizer smudged out the phone number. JERRY  (Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too. KRAMER  (grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts. JERRY  (grabs the ticket back) Give me that.   (Jerry Opens the door and walks into the clothing dept., while Bania is walking towards the exit of the clothing dept.) JERRY  Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)  BANIA  (looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendy's? you can't do that. JERRY  The ticket is worthless. BANIA  You promised me.  (Jerry makes a smudged up face -- he knows he cannot get out of the deal. Bania turns and walks quickly out of the clothing department.   Jerry sees a woman from the back walking into the dressing room area. She has a fur coat on and is carrying a few items over her arm to try on) JERRY  Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?   (Elaine stands at the register counter, now she wears her own clothes. The Calvin Klein dress rests across the counter -- she watches as Jerry follows the woman into the dressing room area. Jerry stands in front of the door where she went into, listens for a half second and then pushes the door open, as she has not had an opportunity to latch it yet -- It is Donna, the dry-cleaners wife -- she is stunned, startled and taken aback ...) DONNA  No it's not. (the coat) JERRY  It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back. DONNA  No, what are you talking about.  (The camera pans down to the bottom of the dressing room door, so all you see is Jerry and Donna's scuffling feet and lower legs, as Jerry takes the coat from her.) DONNA  Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...  JERRY  You can't have that coat, it's not yours.   (Donna opens the door -- the camera pans back up to eye level as she walks out, kind of indignant. She places her long purse strap over her Left shoulder) JERRY  What do you think the dry-cleaner's is your own personal closet!   (Donna walks over to where Elaine is still standing at the register   counter)   CONTINUITY ERROR -- AS SHE WALKS UP TO ELAINE, DONNA IS NOW HOLDING her long purse strap in her right hand only, then switches it to her left hand and puts the strap over her left shoulder. The purse hangs below her left hip. She just had placed the long purse strap over her SHOULDER AS SHE LEFT THE DRESSING ROOM AREA WALKING AWAY FROM JERRY.   ELAINE  Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this? (Holding the bottom of the Calvin Klein dress out) DONNA  Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it in. (Holding the dress up by the hanger) What size is it? ELAINE  (Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of Donna's question)  The camera fades from the previous scene to the winter sidewalk outside.   L-R Kramer, Elaine and Jerry walk silently in the cold. Above their heads in the background is a sign that reads KalSigns -- I believe this is an homage to Jerry's (real life) father that owned a sign company.  Kramer is wearing Jerry's mother's fur coat. It is obviously too small for his large frame -- the arms are way too short. The coat comes down to his mid thigh. He has no pants on. He wears shoes and white socks. He looks ridiculous, uncomfortable and cold.  Elaine is wearing a long winter overcoat, carrying her Calvin Klein dress in a garment bag over her left arm. Jerry has both hands in the pockets of his winter jacket he is wearing a scarf that he had on earlier in the store.  Kramer looks around as he walks along. He tries to button or close up the coat to the best of his ability, but nothing changes. As the scene ends, the fur coat opens slightly at the bottom and you can see his white boxer shorts (actually they look like jockey shorts, but earlier he had on boxers in the dressing room)  The camera fades from the previous scene to an exterior shot of Mendy's Restaurant at dusk, then inside to Bania and Jerry dining at a table.  BANIA  Mmm. This soup is great. JERRY  Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)  BANIA  I told you Mendy's had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it? JERRY  Yeah. I'm having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)  BANIA  Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --  JERRY  (Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.  BANIA  Yeah. Well, let's hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. I'm meeting a woman for a drink. JERRY  Oh, and who might that be? BANIA  Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air)  (Comedy club) JERRY  If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, I'm telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. I'm sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions  of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.  THE END>",

Lets go ELAINE  No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.  JERRY  What's it doin here? ELAINE  He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up  LANDIS  Hello ELAINE  Oh, Hi. LANDIS  Jocylin Landis from Doubleday. I interviewed you for a position   a couple of months ago. ELAINE  Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)  LANDIS  I was watching you play ELAINE  Oh, I'm not very good. LANDIS  No. You exhibited a lot of grace out there.  ELAINE  Really? Grace? LANDIS  Yes. So have you found anything yet?  ELAINE  Uh, no. Not really. LANDIS  You know you should keep in touch. Something may be opening   up in a few weeks. Is that a Bruline? JERRY  Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.  ELAINE  Newman plays tennis? JERRY  He's fantastic. LANDIS  Would you mind if I tried this out?  ELAINE  Uh, no ... take it. LANDIS  How will you get it back? ELAINE  Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.  LANDIS  That's so generous of you. ELAINE  Thanks JERRY  You loaned her Pitt's racquet?  E What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday.   Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.  SANDY  I gotta get going. JERRY  Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.  SANDY  (nods silently) ELAINE  Bye JERRY  Bye bye ELAINE  Have you noticed she never laughs JERRY  Hm, really?

GEORGE  And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'.   I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything.   I don't know how she does it. KRAMER  Maybe she's bulimic GEORGE  Wa? KRAMER  Bulimic, GEORGE  Kramer, she's a model. KRAMER  Exactly GEORGE  I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after   we finish eating. KRAMER  There you go monkey boy.  Pepperdella's Restaurant NINA  Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?  GEORGE  Just enjoying watching you.  Other restaurant SANDY  So did you like the movie? JERRY  Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me.   I missed the sport jacket. SANDY  (nods silently) JERRY  Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him   that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer.   It shows at least he's making an effort. SANDY  (nods silently) That's funny. JERRY  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  Pepperdella's Restaurant NINA  Oh, I'm so full. GEORGE  Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the   old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.  NINA  Will you excuse me. GEORGE  Where you going? NINA  I just need to freshen up. GEORGE  You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem   very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.  NINA  George I need to freshen., George, George, George ...   Jerry's Apartment JERRY  It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her   like superman. ELAINE  See, what did I tell ya? JERRY  And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She   says, \"That's funny.\" ... That's funny! ELAINE  Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can   pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet. JERRY  I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ...   well it's like something! ELAINE  (on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please.   Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh.

GEORGE  From the bathroom. JERRY  Oh, you think she was refunding? GEORGE  Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating   she's runnin to the bathroom. ELAINE  So you're concerned. GEORGE  Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals.   It's like throwing money down the toilet. JERRY  In a manner of speaking. GEORGE  Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what   would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.   Kramer enters. KRAMER  Here's your scrubber back. JERRY  Thanks. GEORGE  Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the   towels in the powder room. JERRY  A matron? GEORGE  Yeah  Kramer nervously waves at to stop Jerry talking. JERRY  uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).  GEORGE  Wha? KRAMER  Nothin' GEORGE  You know a matron? KRAMER  Me?

KRAMER  let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five   years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood.   I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain. GEORGE  Come on, Kramer.

ELAINE  augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy  JERRY  He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?  ELAINE  He'll only play with his racquet JERRY  Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just   take it? ELAINE  That's stealing? JERRY  Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!  ELAINE  I know.  George enters GEORGE  Hey oh. ELAINE  JERRY: Hey JERRY  So what happened with Kramer's mother?  GEORGE  It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant   where Babs works. JERRY  What's she like? GEORGE  Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up   another juicy little nugget about our friend. ELAINE  Ah, I'm ready what? JERRY  What is it? GEORGE  I uh got the first name. ELAINE  You found out Kramer's first name?  GEORGE  That's right. You ready? JERRY  We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?  GEORGE  Cosmo ELAINE  JERRY: Cosmo? GEORGE  Cosmo ELAINE  JERRY: Cosmo  - all laugh - ELAINE  Cosmo, Cosmo?  Kramer enters KRAMER  What's so funny? ... wha? ELAINE  COSMO? KRAMER  All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.   J; Well I got to hand it to you. You did a hell of a job keeping it a secret all these   years. ELAINE  It's not such a bad name. KRAMER  Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name.   That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time   I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry.   I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who   I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!  X's apartment LAURA  Yes? JERRY  Hi, is Sandy here? LAURA  Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want to come in?  JERRY  I would except I forgot to bring a towel.  LAURA  (laughs nicely)  Monks  {Jerry starts.} JERRY  So the roommate laughed at everything I said.  GEORGE  Wow. JERRY  It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of   those big coarse \"ha's.\" You know those? GEORGE  Oh yeah: HA-A-A, HA-A-A. JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Hate the big coarse \"ha.\" Hate those.  JERRY  And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the   other qualities prized by the Superficial Man. GEORGE  I see. JERRY  So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.  GEORGE  Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you   is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention   this to anyone again. JERRY  Can't be done, huh? GEORGE  The Switch? JERRY  \"The Switch.\" GEORGE  Can't be done. JERRY  I wonder. GEORGE  Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has   successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you   could get locked up for even suggesting it! JERRY  They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.  GEORGE  Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and   1200--somewhere--there were two women living together. JERRY  The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without   you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's   get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on   board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be? GEORGE  All right, dammit, I'm in. JERRY  I couldn't do it without you. GEORGE  All right. Let's get to work.  {Now here's the boys' second conversation on the subject, after we've   seen them struggling with the issue over coffee, wandering the sidewalks   of NYC-- all to 40's-style movie music--before continuing their   discussion in Jerry's apartment. George begins this time.} GEORGE  All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see   you first thing in the morning. JERRY  Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You   can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to   begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's   that! GEORGE  We'll come up with something. JERRY  Yeah, sure we will. GEORGE  All right. See you tomorrow. {George sighs, exits.}   {Pregnant pause, then George bursts back in.} GEORGE  I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!  {Commercial, then \"third scene,\"The boys are finishing pizza and beer.   George begins here, slowly, carefully, to make sure Jerry's got it. (Be   sure to keep in mind the descriptions' hilarious visual enactments.)}  GEORGE  All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.  JERRY  All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a ménage à trois with her   and her roommate. GEORGE  That's right. JERRY  And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect.   Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in   disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the   premises. GEORGE  Keep going. JERRY  At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to   apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events. GEORGE  Continue. JERRY  The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as   part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in   the unusual request.  {George takes over.} GEORGE  A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to   be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little   playful humor, which she (Laura) of course cannot resist, an invitation   to a friendly dinner is proffered. JERRY  Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it:   They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back.   She's not gonna do that.  {Another pregnant pause. George?} GEORGE  You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She   tells Laura, \"If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's   your problem.\"  {Final pause. Jerry?} JERRY  It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.  GEORGE  {George, finger in the peanut butter jar}: This is what I do.   Doubleday  Elaine surreptitiously enters office and takes racquet. KEITH  Can I help you? ELAINE  Uh, no, I'm OK. KEITH  Well then what are you doing with that racquet?  ELAINE  Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.  KEITH  Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..  ELAINE  No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.  KEITH  Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing   here. But... ELAINE  All right. I'm going I'm going KEITH  Not with ... ELAINE  Give it give it .. KEITH  Leave ... ELAINE  All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to   Miss. Landis do you? KEITH  I don't have to but I will.  Street  Babs and Kramer CLOTWORTHY  Morning Cosmo KRAMER  Hi Mr. Clotworthy CLOTWORTHY  How are you today? KRAMER  Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine.  LANDIS  Hi Cosmo KRAMER  My mom Babs. LANDIS  Hi Mrs. Kramer BABS  Lorraine KRAMER  Yes, It's a fine day UNSEEN  (Larry David's voice) What do you say Cosmo?  KRAMER  Hey, everything my man.  Sandy's apartment SANDY  What: JERRY  You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its   Manage A Trois. SANDY  Oooo, that is a wild idea JERRY  Uh?  Monks  Kramer and Babs KRAMER  You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.  BABS  Yes, well isn't that just easy for you to say. What the hell do you think   I'm going to do with myself? KRAMER  Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?  BABS  I've been clean for two years. Anyway what would we do together?  KRAMER  I've got plenty of ideas. BABS  I've always believed in you Cosmo. You know that. So I want you to   call that place today and tell then tha you're through. BABS  All right. I'll do it.  Restaurant  George and Nina NINA  Mmmm mm so good. GEORGE  ... so glad. NINA  Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.  GEORGE  And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh  WOMAN  I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.  WAITRESS  Care to see our dessert menu? GEORGE  Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs? WAITRESS  Oh, yeah I was sorry to hear she left.  GEORGE  Babs left? WAITRESS  She quit today.  George runs to bathroom and hears retching sounds.  George enters woman's bathroom GEORGE  Ah Ha. NINA  What are you doing here George? GEORGE  I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.   Nina leaves - woman exits stall GEORGE  How 'ya feelin'?  Street  Newman and Babs BABS  Hi Newman NEWMAN  Hi Babs BABS  What are you doin' NEWMAN  Minding my own business. BABS  You'll never get into trouble that way.  NEWMAN  What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?  BABS  From what I hear you postmen don't have to look too far.  NEWMAN  ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of   finding you. Cigarette? BABS  Don't mind if I do.  Jerry's Apoartment  George knocking on Kramer's door yelling Kramer...  Jerry opens his door. JERRY  Hey  George enters GEORGE  What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night.   The whole thing blew up in my face. JERRY  Ah, that's a shame. GEORGE  Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it.   Did you call her? JERRY  Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.  GEORGE  So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?  JERRY  No actually, she took it pretty well.  GEORGE  So what happened? JERRY  She's into it. GEORGE  Into what? JERRY  The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said   she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.  GEORGE  That's unbelievable. JERRY  Oh, it's a scene man. GEORGE  Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that   you know me and have access to my dementia? JERRY  What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.  GEORGE  You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin   to do it? JERRY  I can't. I'm not an orgy guy. GEORGE  Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.  JERRY  Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes   everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to   grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new   bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirdo lighting.   I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends.  ... Naw, I'm not ready for it. GEORGE  If only something like that could happen to me.  JERRY  Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.  GEORGE  I know.  Elaine enters JERRY  Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?  ELAINE  No, I got caught. JERRY  What do you mean you got caught? ELAINE  Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job.   He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.  JERRY  I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own   racquet. ELAINE  Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.   Kramer enters KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hi Cosmo. ELAINE  Hi Cosmo KRAMER  Thanks man. JERRY  Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?  KRAMER  Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.  JERRY  Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?  KRAMER  Yeah JERRY  Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.  KRAMER  All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's  GEORGE  Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me   out to dry. KRAMER  She quit. GEORGE  It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you   could have said something. That's all.  Trying to enter newman's apartment KRAMER  Don't talk to me George, talk to her.  GEORGE  Well where is she? KRAMER  I don't know.  They enter Newman's apartment - Babs and Newman on the couch.  KRAMER  Ma! BABS  Cosmo! NEWMAN  We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo? THE END>",

Because the players are always changing, the team can move to another city, you're actually rooting for the clothes when you get right down to it.  You know what I mean, you are standing and cheering and yelling for your clothes to beat the clothes from another city.  Fans will be so in love with a player but if he goes to another team, they boo him.  This is the same human being in a different shirt, they *hate* him now.  Boo!  different shirt!!  Boo.  Jerry and George are at a hot dog vendor's cart. JERRY  You sure you don't want the tickets?  GEORGE  No thanks. JERRY  I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.  GEORGE  I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.  JERRY  I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.  GEORGE  Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?  JERRY  Maybe he didn't know? GEORGE  Lemme see.  I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets)  Row F?! JERRY  Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.  GEORGE  Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?  JERRY  I asked.  Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football. GEORGE  Wish I could help you. JERRY  Come on, take them.  You could take Bonnie.  GEORGE  You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?  JERRY  What do you think? GEORGE  So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars.  Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.  JERRY  Yeah, sleeping arrangements.  So, you haven't, uh...  GEORGE  Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet.  Tomorrow night's the first night. JERRY  Aah. GEORGE  Hey, is that Tim Whatley? JERRY  The Dentist? GEORGE  Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?  JERRY  Oh, no.  I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.  GEORGE  Oh good. JERRY  Yeah, I blamed it on you.  Hi Tim.  TIM  Hey Jerry!  George.  What are you up to?  JERRY  Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.  GEORGE  I'm getting a makeover. JERRY  Hey.  How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?  TIM  What, are you kidding? JERRY  Here.  Two tickets.  Have a good time.  TIM  How can I think you?  I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime.  You ever been to Mendys? JERRY  No no no.  No dinner.  Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone. JERRY  Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift.  I know, it's a label maker.  The Label Baby Junior.  Yeah, I hear they're good.  Well, label me thankful.  Okay, well you enjoy those tickets.  Buh-bye.  Jerry hangs up, there's a pounding on the door. JERRY  Come in.  More pounding.  Jerry opens the door and Kramer backs in carrying a board game.  KRAMER  Where can I put this? JERRY  What is it? KRAMER  It's Risk, Jerry.  The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off   the table with his foot and setting the game board down)  Alright, that's perfect.  Newman walks in. JERRY  Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman)  Hello, Newman.  NEWMAN  Hello, Jerry.  Will he take it?  I gotta go to work.  JERRY  Take what? KRAMER  The board, Jerry.  We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go. JERRY  So why don't you leave it at Newman's?  NEWMAN  I wanted to, he won't let me. KRAMER  We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it. JERRY  So that's here? KRAMER  Yes, yes.  You're like Switzerland.  JERRY  I don't wanna be Switzerland. KRAMER  Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination.  It's winner take all.  People cannot be trusted.  NEWMAN  Don't look at me. KRAMER  Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.  JERRY  Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.  KRAMER  Alright, so you're gonna look after it?  JERRY  Yeah, yeah. KRAMER  Stay strong buddy. JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Watch it good. JERRY  Ok.  Kramer leaves, Elaine enters. ELAINE  Hey. JERRY  Hey. ELAINE  Hey.  Oh, is that a label maker? JERRY  Yes it is.  I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.  ELAINE  Love the Label Baby, baby.  You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas. JERRY  Tim Whatley? ELAINE  Yeah.  Who sent you that one? JERRY  One Tim Whatley!  Elaine.  No, my Tim Whatley? JERRY  The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.  ELAINE  I think this is the same one I gave him.  He recycled this gift.  He's   a regifter! JERRY  Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing.  Perhaps it's an homage. ELAINE  Yeah, perhaps. JERRY  Well how did he react when you gave it to him?  ELAINE  Um, he said, \"Oh.  A label maker.  Howbout that?\"  JERRY  He repeated the name of the gift? ELAINE  Yeah, so? JERRY  Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like   it. ELAINE  What do you mean? JERRY  Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, \"Oh. Tube socks.\"  What are you gonna do about it? ELAINE  I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see   if he's got a label maker. JERRY  Why'd you get him a gift anyway? ELAINE  Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present. JERRY  Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm a large.  George and his girlfriend, Bonnie, are entering her apartment.  BONNIE  Well, here we are.  This is the place.  GEORGE  Wow. BONNIE  Do you like it? GEORGE  I love it!  This is fantastic!  Look at this couch, is this velvet?!  BONNIE  Are you a velvet fan? GEORGE  A fan?  I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors! BONNIE  Aren't they great? (sees a man enter from the bedroom)  Oh, Scott, hi.   This is George.  George, this is Scott, my roommate.  Scott walks into the kitchen. GEORGE  Heh heh. BONNIE  Here, check out this view.  If you lean out this window, you can see the river.  Scott returns from the kitchen eating an apple, and heads back to the bedroom.  GEORGE  So Scott's your roommate, huh? BONNIE  Yes.  Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him.  GEORGE  No, you didn't mention it. BONNIE  He's a great guy, you'll really like him.  GEORGE  I'm sure I will.  George and Jerry are at the coffee shop. JERRY  Male roommate, huh? GEORGE  Yes.  A male roommate. JERRY  Is this a problem? GEORGE  It's a huge problem, Jerry.  The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place!  He's already got that.  JERRY  Well, maybe he's -- GEORGE  No.  Believe me, he's not. JERRY  So he's an eligible receiver. GEORGE  She's confiding in him about our dates.  You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date!  It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.' JERRY  What's stopping them? GEORGE  Exactly!  You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage. JERRY  What does he look like? GEORGE  Oh, that's the worst part of it.  He looks just like me.  JERRY  He looks like you and he's working from the inside?  GEORGE  I look like me and I'm working from the outside.  Who do you think is   in the better position? JERRY  Not you. GEORGE  Ho ho.  This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!  JERRY  We'll take a check please. GEORGE  I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment.  It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet.  You know, if it were socially acceptable--  JERRY  I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.  GEORGE  I've said that before? JERRY  Many times.  You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet. KRAMER  Hey. GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Guess what?  I saw Newman talking to the super.  JERRY  So what? KRAMER  The super has keys to your apartment.  Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack. JERRY  Oh, maybe he's got no hot water. KRAMER  Yeah, alright, fine.  You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world.  But he'd be a horrible leader.  And you know who's gonna suffer?  The little people; you and George. JERRY  Are you through? KRAMER  Oh.  I talked to Arthur Jobanian.  Yeah, the Drake's wedding?  That's off. JERRY  The wedding is off?  What happened?  KRAMER  The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl.  So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.  Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment. GEORGE  The wedding is off.  Now you can go to the Super Bowl.  JERRY  I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.  GEORGE  You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period. JERRY  Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving?  There's no grace period. GEORGE  Well, didn't he regift the label maker?  JERRY  Possibly. GEORGE  Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?  JERRY  You may have a point. GEORGE  I have a point, I have a point. JERRY  Alright, I'll call him. GEORGE  Yeah.  What's that? JERRY  Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys   who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials)  Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you?  Well it turns out I can use them.  Oh, you do?  I understand.  Okay.  Bye.  He already made plans, he can't change them. GEORGE  Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them. JERRY  Thanks. GEORGE  Alright, I gotta go.  I'm heading over to Bonnie's.  JERRY  What are you gonna do about the roommate?  GEORGE  I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him.  It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick. JERRY  Well, the pickle breath is a good start.   George leaves, Newman enters, or would except Jerry tries slamming the door on him. NEWMAN  Hello Jerry, may I come in? JERRY  What do you want? NEWMAN  Nothing, just being  neighborly.  Do you wanna hang out?  Shoot the breeze? JERRY  I'm not letting you cheat, Newman.  You're not getting anywhere near that board. NEWMAN  Jerry?  I'm a little insulted. JERRY  You're not a little anything, Newman.  So just pack it up and move it out of here. NEWMAN  Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?  JERRY  I dunno, watch it on TV I guess.  Why?  NEWMAN  Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me.  I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.  JERRY  You're going to the Super Bowl? NEWMAN  Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me. JERRY  What's his name? NEWMAN  Tim Whatley. JERRY  That's my ticket! NEWMAN  Is it?!  Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me!  Ha ha ha. JERRY  Newman!  George and Bonnie are at Bonnie's GEORGE  What a movie.  Good choice. BONNIE  Thank Scott.  He recommended it. GEORGE  Oh, Scott, Scott.  He's really great, isn't he?  BONNIE  Yes he is. GEORGE  Yes he is.  Let me ask you something.  When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that? BONNIE  George? GEORGE  Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze? BONNIE  George, you're being ridiculous. GEORGE  What's the massage situation? BONNIE  What do you mean? GEORGE  Is there any work being done?  Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?  BONNIE  George, would you just stop? GEORGE  Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit?  I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are? BONNIE  George, what is wrong with you? GEORGE  I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate!  It's   unnatural, it's an abomination!  Scott enters. SCOTT  Hey! GEORGE  Hey! SCOTT  How ya going? GEORGE  I'm good. SCOTT  Are you gonna need the bathroom?  'Cause I'm gonna jump in the shower. BONNIE  No, just throw my bras out of the way.   Elaine and Tim Whatley are walking together on the street. TIM  Well, this is my building. ELAINE  Yes it is. TIM  This was fun, you know? ELAINE  Yeah. TIM  So, I'll call. ELAINE  Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?  TIM  Upstairs?  You wanna go upstairs? ELAINE  I would love to go upstairs. TIM  Elaine, you are something else.  No one can ever put a label on you, huh?  ELAINE  We'll see.  Jerry and George are at their booth in the coffee shop. JERRY  Newman.  He's going with Newman. GEORGE  How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?  JERRY  Newman's his mailman. GEORGE  Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!  JERRY  Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?! GEORGE  Well, he's merry. JERRY  He is merry, I'll give him that.  (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for? GEORGE  I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.  JERRY  Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.   Elaine enters. ELAINE  Hey, guess what?  I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.  JERRY  What? ELAINE  We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.  JERRY  What about the label maker? ELAINE  Ah, well. JERRY  Wait a minute, that's my ticket!  You didn't even want to go.  ELAINE  It was totally out of the blue.  We went upstairs to his apartment, you   know, to look for the label maker. JERRY  So, how did you get up there?  Did you say you had to use the bathroom?  ELAINE  No. JERRY  Then how'd you get up there? ELAINE  I said, \"Do you wanna go upstairs?\"  GEORGE  And there's you ticket. ELAINE  What? JERRY  That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.  ELAINE  Why? JERRY  You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're   Mae West?  Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.  ELAINE  You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going   downtown? JERRY  Obviously. ELAINE  You're crazy. GEORGE  Well, what happened when you got upstairs?  ELAINE  As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave.  I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker. JERRY  Yeah, well I don't trust this guy.  I think he regifted, he degifted,   and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.   Jerry is in the hallway approaching his apartment door.  Kramer walks out of his apartment. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey.  What are you doing? KRAMER  I'm watching your door. JERRY  My door? KRAMER  Yeah, from my peephole.  Fisheye, sees all.   Cut to the interior of Jerry's apartment.  Newman sneaks out from the bedroom towards the table where the Risk board is sitting.  He accidentally knocks some CDs off the shelving unit, making a lot of noise. JERRY  What was that? KRAMER  Newman!  Jerry begins opening the door, Newman does not have enough time to change the board pieces. NEWMAN  Damn! JERRY  The bedroom!  Jerry runs to the bedroom, catching a glimpse of Newman climbing out the open window and up the fire escape.  Jerry and Kramer rush to the window.  JERRY  I see you, Newman!  I see you! KRAMER  I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!   Elaine and Tim Whatley are sharing a cab. ELAINE  I've got a confession to make. TIM  Oh?  What's that? ELAINE  I've got Super Bowl fever. TIM  Oh yeah, me too. ELAINE  So where are we staying? TIM  Oh, the Ambassador. ELAINE  Oh.  Big room? TIM  It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.  ELAINE  Downtown? TIM  Right downtown. ELAINE  What do they have there, a couple of beds?  TIM  Why?  You bringing someone else? ELAINE  No, but don't you think there should be two beds?  There's two of us.   Tim's grin disappears.  George enters Bonnie's apartment. BONNIE  Oh, a cactus. GEORGE  They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.  They share a laugh.  Scott enters from the back holding a cardboard box.  He places it on a stack of similar boxes. SCOTT  Well, look who's here. BONNIE  I asked Scott to move out. GEORGE  Oh.  Oh!  George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.  Kramer and Newman are seated at the Risk board on the living room table. JERRY  So she kicked him out of the apartment.  GEORGE  That's right.  It's just me and her.  JERRY  Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.  GEORGE  I guess she did.  He's gone, now I'm the man.  JERRY  That's not a good role for you. GEORGE  No, it's not. JERRY  You unwittingly made a major commitment.  That's a lot of pressure.  GEORGE  Oh my god. JERRY  You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.  GEORGE  I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.  JERRY  He was shouldering. GEORGE  I couldn't leave well enough alone?!  JERRY  Where are you going? GEORGE  I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping. JERRY  Oh, well here.  Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again. GEORGE  Thanks. KRAMER  Yeah.  I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it. JERRY  So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?  NEWMAN  Yeah.  I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him. JERRY  Thanks for having me over, guys.  Jerry and George are out on the street, Tim Whatley comes running up.  JERRY  Alright, I'll see you later. TIM  Hey Jerry? JERRY  Ah, Tim Whatley.  Out scalping? TIM  Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible.  Listen, I want to give you a ticket back. JERRY  Are you serious, what about Elaine?  TIM  Oh, Elaine.  Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they   would. JERRY  Oh.  (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck)  Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up)  Hey, Cosmo!!  They're towing your car!!  KRAMER  What?!  Not my car!!  Hey!!  They're towing my car!!  Kramer runs out the door, leaving Newman alone with the Risk board, but only for a moment.  He runs back in and grabs the board. NEWMAN  What are you doing? KRAMER  I'm taking the board with me.  Kramer runs out carrying the board, Newman follows a moment later.   Back on the street, Kramer's car is jacked up and the driver is just taking off. Kramer comes running after it, yelling at the driver and balancing the game board with Newman at his heels. TIM  So, I guess I'll see you at the game.  JERRY  Yeah, see you there.  George walks into Bonnie's apartment, *everything* is boxed up and Bonnie is taping up the last of the boxes.  He knocks to get her attention.  BONNIE  Hi, George. GEORGE  What, what happened?  Where's, where's all the stuff?  BONNIE  It's gone.  It was all his.  Is this a label maker?  GEORGE  The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?  BONNIE  They were his.  Besides, we don't need any of those things.  We have each other.  Kramer and Newman are on a subway car, the Risk board sits on their laps.  NEWMAN  Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?  KRAMER  Oh, stop stalling.  Come on. NEWMAN  I can't think, there's all this noise.  KRAMER  Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland?  I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation. NEWMAN  I'm not beaten yet.  I still have armies in the Ukraine.   This comment perks up the ears of what appears to be a Russian immigrant.  KRAMER  Ha ha, the Ukraine.  Do you know what the Ukraine is?  It's a sitting duck.  A road apple, Newman.  The Ukraine is weak.  It's feeble.  I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine. UKRAINIAN  I come from Ukraine.  You not say Ukraine weak.  KRAMER  Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.  UKRAINIAN  Ukraine is game to you?!  Howbout I take your little board and smash it!!  The Ukrainian pounds the game board, destroying it and sending army pieces flying.  Tim Whatley approaches his building, Elaine is waiting at the door.  ELAINE  Hello, Tim. TIM  Elaine, hi. ELAINE  Don't worry, Tim.  I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all.  I just came by to pick up my label maker.  I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back. TIM  But you gave it to me. ELAINE  But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl.  Hand it over, Whatley.  TIM  Uh, ok. ELAINE  You don't have the label maker, do you?  TIM  Uh, no. ELAINE  I knew it!  You're a regifter! TIM  Oh, yeah, some gift.  That thing didn't work at all.  ELAINE  What? TIM  You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right   off.  It was the worst gift I ever got. ELAINE  Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work.  The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive. TIM  Oh, Elaine!  They embrace passionately.  First the exterior, then the interior of a mail truck.  Boxes are being jostled. A close-up of a box labeled with \"Scott Thomas\" and a street address is shown. The labels fall off the box, one by one.  First the exterior, then the interior of a football stadium.  Jerry is walking down the aisle. JERRY  H... G... F.  Seat four.  One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.  NEWMAN  Hello, Jerry.  Tim couldn't make it, he's in love.  Isn't that wonderful? JERRY  Oh, it's enchanting.  George is bringing a portable TV to Bonnie's so they can watch the game.  BONNIE  Hi. GEORGE  Here's the TV.  I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl.  Do you at least have some towels we could sit on?  It's, like, a four hour game.  BONNIE  George, Scott's gonna drop by.  He said he never got his boxes.  I'll get the towels. GEORGE  How am I gonna get out of this?  Think Costanza, think!  BONNIE  Here we are. GEORGE  Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.  BONNIE  What is it? GEORGE  Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Ménage à Trois? BONNIE  What?  Just then, Scott enters. SCOTT  Hi. BONNIE  Scott!  Remember what we talked about the other day?  George is into it. SCOTT  Oh really?!  Scott walks towards George, the camera moves in on a close-up of an increasingly horrified George, and freezes.  Jerry and Newman are at the Super Bowl. NEWMAN  Great streak of luck I'm having.  First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.  JERRY  Can you move over at all?! NEWMAN  And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels.  No labels, Jerry.  You know what that means?  Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable. JERRY  An inch!  Can you move over an inch?!? THE END>",

        "text": "  THE RACE Written by Tom Gammill, Max Pross &amp; Larry David   (Comedy club)  The Christmas tree certainly seems to inspire a love/hate relationship. All that time is spent selecting it and decorating it, and then a week after it's just thrown somewhere, you see it by the side of the road, it looks like a mob hit. A car slows down, a door opens and this tree just rolls out. People snap out of that Christmas spirit like it was a drunken stupor, they just wake up one morning and go, \"Oh my god, there's a tree inside the house! Just throw it anywhere!   (Lois's office) JERRY  Ready to go Lois? LOIS  You really like to say my name? Don't you?  JERRY  Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.  LOIS  Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry.  DUNCAN  Jerry Seinfeld! JERRY  Duncan Meyers! LOIS  You two know each other? DUNCAN  Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we   Jerry? Gee I hope you're not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do.  LOIS  Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush   hour to pick me up? JERRY  Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.   (Elaine's Apartment) ELAINE  No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?  LEW  You no order Chicken Cashew. ELAINE  I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.  LEW  Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list.  ELAINE  What list? LEW  The \"do not deliver\" list. ELAINE  MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.  GEORGE  Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?  ELAINE  Ned must have left it here. GEORGE  Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A   communist? ELAINE  HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.  GEORGE  Maybe he's just \"very well RED\"? ELAINE  Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told   me? GEORGE  Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?  ELAINE  Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.  GEORGE  Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. \"Exciting   uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important.\" . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.   (Jerry enters) JERRY  Hi oh. ELAINE  and GEORGE: Hey. ELAINE  Where's Lois? JERRY  She couldn't make it.  ===========break ======== GEORGE  I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named   Lois. JERRY  I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.  GEORGE  Duncan Meyers? ELAINE  Who's he? JERRY  Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.  ELAINE  Uh uh JERRY  I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .  ELAINE  What's that? JERRY  Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher. ELAINE  Oh, of course. JERRY  He was down at the other end. So he yells out, \"Ready, On your mark, Get set, \" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.  ELAINE  No. GEORGE  I looked up. I couldn't believe it.  JERRY  By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.  ELAINE  Really? JERRY  And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my   speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me   ever since. Now he's back. ELAINE  Well what happened when you raced him again?  JERRY  I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.  ELAINE  So now Duncan is back? JERRY  He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man   that's some tart cider!

And I don't think she believes me.  GEORGE  He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School.

(Monks) DUNCAN  But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already beaten you in Junior High School three times.  JERRY  I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?   (George enters) DUNCAN  That's what I've always wondered about.  JERRY  Well, I . . . (sees George) GEORGE  Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!  JERRY  I'm sorry, uh, GEORGE  George, George Costanza! JERRY  Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.

I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?  JERRY  This is Lois. LOIS  Hello. GEORGE  So what have you been doing with yourself?  JERRY  I'm I'm a comedian. GEORGE  Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that \"did you ever notice?\" this kind of stuff.  JERRY  Yeah, yeah GEORGE  It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.  JERRY  Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. JERRY  You really used to have a think full head of hair.  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.  JERRY  yeah, yeah. LOIS  What do you do? GEORGE  I'm an architect. LOIS  Have you designed any buildings in New York?  GEORGE  Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?  LOIS  You did that? GEORGE  Yep. And it didn't take very long either.  JERRY  Well you've really built yourself up into something.  GEORGE  Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry. JERRY  Well, one cannot help( but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.  GEORGE  Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.  JERRY  Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?  GEORGE  You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.  JERRY  George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.  GEORGE  Ha, uh, JERRY  I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.  GEORGE  Oh, the big race. JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Yes, yes,. LOIS  You were there? GEORGE  Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.  DUNCAN  Miss Stafford? GEORGE  Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .  JERRY  George! GEORGE  But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.  JERRY  Did I get a head start? GEORGE  Head start, oh no absolutely not. JERRY  You satisfied? So you see? DUNCAN  No, I'm still not convinced and I never will be.  LOIS  Why don't the two of you just race again?  DUNCAN  That's a good idea. JERRY  No, no, no, another race - out of the question.  DUNCAN  I know, you've been saying that for twenty years because you know you can't beat me. You couldn't beat me then and you can't beat me now.  LOIS  Race him Jerry. Race him. JERRY  All right! I'll do it. The race is on.   (Jerry's apartment) ELAINE  . . . shut up! (?) JERRY  And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus   (Street) KRAMER  Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.  MICKEY  What does that mean? KRAMER  Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.  MICKEY  So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?  KRAMER  There are no delicatessens under Communism.  MICKEY  Why not? KRAMER  Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.  MICKEY  So you can't get Corned Beef? KRAMER  Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.   (Jerry's Apartment) GEORGE  (on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me   in his office. JERRY  So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist.   You just called the woman for a date.  (Phone rings) JERRY  Hello, oh hi Duncan, 4:00 o'clock tomorrow? That is not   going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!   (Elaine's Apartment) NED  I'm sorry Elaine. The shirt's too fancy.  ELAINE  Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?  NED  All right, I'll try it on. ELAINE  I'm going to order Chinese Food. NED  You're ordering from Hop Sing's, right?  ELAINE  Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.  NED  Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive.  ELAINE  You're father was blacklisted? NED  Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They \"named names\".  ELAINE  Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.  LEW  I know that address. You're Benes, right. You're on our list. No more delivery.  ELAINE  No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.  LEW  Oh, yeah. What's the name? ELAINE  Why do you need the name? You already have the address.  LEW  We need a name. Give us a name. ELAINE  Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.  (Coleman's Department Store) KID  I want a racing car set. KRAMER  Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.  KID  But I want a racing car set. KRAMER  You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.  KID  Hey, this guy's a COMMIE! MICKEY  Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?  KID  Commie, Commie, Commie . . . (unknown) .  MICKEY  Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa!  STORE MANAGER  Is there a problem here? KRAMER  ho ho ho ho. KID  This guy's a Commie. He's spreading propoganda.  STORE MANAGER  Oh yeah? Well that's enough pinko! You're through. The both of ya'  MICKEY  I got two kids in college. KRAMER  You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus.  STORE MANAGER  Not anymore. Get your skinny ass out of here.   (Jerry's Car) JERRY  Hi how are you? LOIS  . . . Fine. JERRY  What's the matter? LOIS  I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you don't race, he's going to fire me.  JERRY  What? He can't do that. LOIS  Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going to do Jerry?  JERRY  Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.   (Elaine's Apartment) LEW  Ah, I knew it was you! You tried to trick Hop Sing! You are onour list; Elaine Benes! And now you are on our list; Ned Isakoff.  NED  You got me blacklisted from Hop Sing's?  LEW  She named name!  (Steinbrenner's Office) GEORGE  You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?  STEINBRENNER  Yes George, I did. Come in, come in. George, the wordaround the office is that you're a Communist.  GEORGE  C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.  STEINBRENNER  You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization.  GEORGE  Sir? STEINBRENNER  You could be invaluable to this franchise. George,   there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look at;   something Rodriguez, I don't really know his name. You get yourselfdown to Havana right away.  GEORGE  Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best. STEINBRENNER  Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...   (On the Street) MICKEY  That was quick! Nice job, Santa! KRAMER  Yeah, MICKEY  I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble.  KRAMER  Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.  MICKEY  Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee.   K I guess I screwed up! MICKEY  You sure did. Big time.  (Street - race begins) ELAINE  How do you feel? JERRY  I need a miracle. DUNCAN  Now you're going to see what kind of liar you're mixed up with.  LOIS  If he beats you I want a big raise.  DUNCAN  If he beats me, I'll not only give you a raise, I'll send you to Hawaii for two weeks.  KRAMER  I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.  GEORGE  Okay, all right, all right. MR. BEVILACQUA  You ready boys? JERRY  Yes, Mr. Beviacqua MR. BEVILACQUA  Okay, this is hoiw it works. You take your marks, I say, READY - ON YOUR MARK - GET SET - and then fire. You got it?  DUNCAN  and JERRY: Yes Mr. Bevilacqua.  (Kramer enters his car)  (Mr. Bevilacqua raises gun) MR. BEVILACQUA  READY - ON YOUR MARK  (Kramer's car backfires)  (Jerry is off early and wins the race - the crowd goes crazy - )  LOIS  So will you come to Hawaii with me Jerry?  JERRY  Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.   (Jerry winks at camera like in the Superman movie)  (Havana)  (George enters Castro's office (like Steinbrenner) GEORGE  You wanted to see me, El Presidente?  CASTRO  Si, si. (a Spanish word I can't figure out) Come here.   I understand you are very interested in one of our players, eh?  GEORGE  Si, si. CASTRO  Ordinarily I would not grant such a request but I've heard you   are, uh, how you say, Communista simpatico, eh? GEORGE  Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy. CASTRO  Well good, then you can have your pick.  GEORGE  Oh, oh! CASTRO  They will play for your Yankees. GEORGE  Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.  CASTRO  And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one.   THE END>",

Which I don't get, because I thought, if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses? 'You need glasses', isn't that what they say? I mean, an eye doctor doesn't say 'Would you care for some glasses?' When people have crutches, they don't havelike a little chain attached to their belt, so they can just let go of 'em every now and then. Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for when you're water-skiing, the thing could just... (mimes semi-airborne wig with hand)   (Street)  George hurrying along, he passes Gary who recognises him. GARY  Hey George. GEORGE  Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months. GARY  I know. I've been pretty busy. GEORGE  Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?  GARY  Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you.   (Different Street)  A cop, with an eye patch, is writing a ticket for a car. Kramer is about to cross the street. He waits for a car to pass. As it passes, a tray of litter is tossed from its window and lands near Kramer. KRAMER  (to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!   The cop hears this and turns to see who said it. As he does so, the car he is ticketing starts up and speeds away. COP  (at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!  Kramer takes advantage of the distraction to run away.  (Jerry's Apartment) JERRY  So you called the cop a pig? KRAMER  I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town. JERRY  Didn't you explain that to the cop?  KRAMER  No, I fled the scene.  George enters. He looks disquieted. JERRY  (to George) Hey. KRAMER  (to George) Hey buddy. GEORGE  Hey, uh... KRAMER  What? GEORGE  Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.  KRAMER  Oh. What about? GEORGE  Kramer... KRAMER  Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?   Kramer grabs George in a headlock. GEORGE  Hey, you're hurting me! KRAMER  You gonna share it with me next time, huh?  GEORGE  I swear, I swear! KRAMER  Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.   He releases George from the headlock and exits, but he closes the door slowly and can be seen peering in through the decreasing gap until it finally shuts completely. Jerry and George watch him until the door is closed.  GEORGE  Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.  JERRY  Oh yeah, I knew. GEORGE  You knew? How did you know? JERRY  He told me a few months ago. GEORGE  Why did he tell you and not me? JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  How are you closer to him than me?   Jerry shrugs. GEORGE  So, is he okay? JERRY  Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.  GEORGE  Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?  JERRY  No, he was on his regular bed. GEORGE  So why didn't you tell me? JERRY  He swore me to secrecy. GEORGE  So? JERRY  It's not like you're my wife. GEORGE  Well, I still think you shoulda told me.  JERRY  Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal   with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick. GEORGE  Well, I wanna talk to him about this.  JERRY  That's right, you let him have it.  GEORGE  Mmm-mm. JERRY  Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?  GEORGE  That's what I'm saying. JERRY  His illness is your business. GEORGE  If not mine, whose? JERRY  If not now, when?  The door opens and Elaine enters. She senses a conversation has just ceased.  ELAINE  Were you just talking about me? GEORGE  No, an old friend of ours, Gary. ELAINE  Oh, the guy with cancer? GEORGE  (to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!  JERRY  If I told you, you woulda given it away.  GEORGE  You don't think I can keep a secret?  JERRY  No, but he would've read your face.  GEORGE  You don't trust my poker face? JERRY  Do you ever win at poker? GEORGE  (shamefaced) No.  Door opens and Kramer enters. He sees Elaine. KRAMER  Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.  ELAINE  Egh, Jake Jarmel? KRAMER  Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.  ELAINE  Why? You don't wear glasses. KRAMER  I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.  GEORGE  I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like   me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in. KRAMER  Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy? ELAINE  Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.  KRAMER  Ah. ELAINE  You know, we had a really bad break-up.  JERRY  The Jujy Fruits? ELAINE  (upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.  (Waldenbooks)  A queue of people wait to have their hardbacks signed by Jake Jarmel, who sits at a table, wearing spectacles with dark oval frames. Kramer is having his copy signed. JAKE  Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book. KRAMER  Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames? JAKE  I can't tell you that. KRAMER  So you don't know where you got 'em?  JAKE  Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.  KRAMER  Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)  (Monk's)  George and Gary sit in a booth. Among the other customers is an attractive woman sitting in the corner, reading a book. GEORGE  Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.  GARY  Really? GEORGE  Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to   anybody. GARY  Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi.  GEORGE  (pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.  GARY  Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the   whole table knows. GEORGE  Well I still think it was wrong. GARY  Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself.  GEORGE  (well, obviously) Yes.  (Another street)  Kramer is talking to the eyepatch-wearing cop. KRAMER  ...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted   to be a policeman. COP  Yeah? So why didn't you? KRAMER  Scared of being shot. COP  Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again! KRAMER  I like that eye patch.  (Monks') GEORGE  (standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in   this city. GARY  (standing) Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own   that parking lot around the corner. GEORGE  Wha, that's a Kinney lot? GARY  Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for you. You just   have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month. GEORGE  Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.  GARY  All right, I got lunch, all right.  GEORGE  You still owe me a secret. GARY  All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right?  GEORGE  Yeah? GARY  Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry.  GEORGE  What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.  GARY  Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie.  GEORGE  Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?  GARY  Well, I (laughs) I never actually had cancer. (laughs) I'll see you. (leaves)  (Jerry's apartment)  Kramer and Jerry sit on the couch, Elaine in the chair. Kramer and Elaine are talking, Jerry reads a magazine. ELAINE  So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?  KRAMER  (rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)  ELAINE  Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know,   he has to be the only one who has 'em. KRAMER  Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi. ELAINE  What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi? JERRY  I never heard her say hi. KRAMER  Well, it's uh, common courtesy. ELAINE  No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand. JERRY  It's like a game of tag.  Elaine gathers her stuff together, ready to leave. JERRY  Where you going? ELAINE  Nowhere. JERRY  You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?  ELAINE  So what if I do? (heads for the door)  KRAMER  (to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!  George enters as Kramer and Elaine leave. He closes the door behind him.  JERRY  Hey. How'd it go with Gary? GEORGE  (shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)  JERRY  (suspicious) Really? GEORGE  (shifty) Yeah. JERRY  You look like something's on your mind.  GEORGE  No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)  JERRY  So, that's your poker face. GEORGE  My regular face. JERRY  No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.  GEORGE  What are you saying? JERRY  All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)  GEORGE  I got nothing. JERRY  What you got, a pair of bullets? GEORGE  What you talking about? JERRY  Two pair? Three of a kind? GEORGE  Will you stop it? JERRY  Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!  GEORGE  I don't have a flush. JERRY  A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see   'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!  GEORGE  (broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!   (Waldenbooks)  Jake Jarmel is at the same table as before. Elaine is talking to him. There are other people queuing behind her. ELAINE  So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi. JAKE  You're saying you didn't say hi. ELAINE  That's what I'm saying. JAKE  So that's what you came down here to tell me?  ELAINE  Correct. JAKE  You never said hi? ELAINE  Correct. JAKE  You still like me, don't you? ELAINE  Correct. (catches herself) What's that?  MAN  Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.  ELAINE  (takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you? JAKE  Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi. ELAINE  Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...   (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it. JERRY  So what was wrong with him? GEORGE  Nothing! JERRY  So he's been lying to me for two months?!  GEORGE  That's right. JERRY  What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be   able to do something like this, and that's you. GEORGE  Well... JERRY  I don't even think you could do it.  GEORGE  Oh, I could do it. JERRY  Yeah, I guess you could. GEORGE  (snorts) C'mon. JERRY  Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get   chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease? GEORGE  You did that? JERRY  Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)  GEORGE  Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry) JERRY  Why not? GEORGE  (puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.  JERRY  So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see   him tomorrow. GEORGE  Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice. JERRY  Why didn't he tell me? GEORGE  Because you were being so nice. JERRY  I don't think I can be that nice. GEORGE  (shouts) You be nice!  George and Jerry turn their backs to other and angrily stalk away from each other.  (Monk's)  Jerry enters. He looks around for Gary, and does a double-take as he see him sitting in a booth, wearing a wig. JERRY  Gary? GARY  What d'you think? Check it out. (he tries a number of expressions, turning   his head side to side, to show off the hairpiece) JERRY  Is that from my gift certificate? GARY  Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice. (shakes Jerry by the hand) JERRY  (through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.  GARY  Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my fillings, 'cos that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings.  JERRY  I don't think so. GARY  Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look.   Jerry can be seen struggling against his instincts. He hears George's words from earlier. GEORGE  You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...  Jerry leans forward and opens his mouth, but he's not happy about it.  GARY  (peering in) Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're loaded.  JERRY  Okay. (shuts mouth) GARY  Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, Jack! (rises)   Kramer enters. He's wearing an eyepatch like the cop's. KRAMER  (to Jerry) Hey buddy. JERRY  Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?  KRAMER  It's an eyepatch. JERRY  You look like a pirate. KRAMER  I wanna be a pirate. JERRY  (gesturing) This is Gary. KRAMER  (to Gary) How you doing? GARY  All right.  Kramer goes to shake Gary by the hand, but due to his impaired vision, he misses by several inches at the first attempt. He lifts the patch up to restore his depth perception. They shake, and Gary leaves to talk to the 'girl who never talks'. Kramer moves to sit in the vacant seat. KRAMER  Well, I tell you there's only one problem.   Kramer sits down, misjudges the seat and almost slides under the table. He upsets plates and glasses. JERRY  Can't see on your right side? KRAMER  No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy   (George's car) DEBBY  Nice car. GEORGE  Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.  DEBBY  So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?  GEORGE  Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.  DEBBY  I didn't say hi. GEORGE  You didn't? DEBBY  Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi.  GEORGE  Regards? DEBBY  Yeah, regards.  (Cab) ELAINE  Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't   say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness? CABBIE  (heavy accent) Smugness is not a good quality.  ELAINE  (looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend. CABBIE  Good. Revenge is very good.  (Street)  Elaine is running after a guy who is indeed wearing identical spectacles to Mr Jarmel. ELAINE  (calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir? GUY  Yes? ELAINE  Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses? GUY  Malaysia. ELAINE  Malaysia? GUY  Yeah. ELAINE  Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?  GUY  Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.  ELAINE  (positive) Oh! (little chuckle) GUY  But I, I can barely see without these.  ELAINE  C'mon. GUY  Well, these were expensive. ELAINE  Let's start the bidding.  (George's car) GEORGE  So, you didn't think this was a date?  DEBBY  N... no, not really. Why, is it... a date?  GEORGE  I thought it was a date. DEBBY  No. It's not a date. GEORGE  What about the regards? DEBBY  Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the   fact is... (sighs) I shouldn't say anything. GEORGE  No, tell me. DEBBY  Can you keep a secret? GEORGE  Me? Oh yeah. DEBBY  (deep breath) I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, h...   he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I... I fell in love with him. GEORGE  Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.   (Monk's)  Jerry and Kramer in their booth. JERRY  Hey, do you know what the Whip does?  KRAMER  What whip? JERRY  The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.  KRAMER  Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)  Gary returns from talking to the 'girl who never talks'. GARY  She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody. Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack!  (Street)  The eye patch-wearing cop spots a familiar Dodge. COP  Well, well. The 'white whale'.  He moves in for the kill.  (George's car) GEORGE  (frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan. DEBBY  Don't complain, at least you have your health.   (Street)  The guy Elaine bought the glasses from is peering blurrily about. It's clear he can barely see anything. He steps between cars and out into the road.   (George's car) DEBBY  George, look out for that man!  (Monk's)  The sound of tires squealing is heard from outside, followed immediately by the crash of cars colliding. Kramer leaps to his feet and heads out to investigate.   (Street)  The cop has obviously been distracted by the same noises whilst writing a ticket. The scofflaw has taken advantage, and the Dodge squeals away, passing Kramer as he emerges from Monk's. COP  (to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!  KRAMER  (looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!   (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?  JERRY  Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that? GEORGE  No. Definitely not. JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't. JERRY  And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.  GEORGE  The one who always sits by herself?  JERRY  Yeah! GEORGE  How did he do that? JERRY  Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.  GEORGE  Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective! JERRY  She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective? GEORGE  (opening door to leave) He picked her up?  JERRY  Walked right over to her table. GEORGE  Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)  (Waldenbooks)  Jake still at the signing table. People still queuing. Elaine skips past the queue. ELAINE  Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too. JAKE  Where did you get those? ELAINE  Malaysia. I was in the area.  Jake thumps the desk in frustrated rage.  (Newman's car)  Newman is sitting alone. The door opens and Kramer jumps in.  NEWMAN  (surprised) Kramer. KRAMER  Just drive.  Newman puts the car in gear and sets off. KRAMER  All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw. NEWMAN  (defensive) What're you talking about...  KRAMER  (interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.  NEWMAN  All right, so it's me. So what? KRAMER  You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in. NEWMAN  I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!  KRAMER  Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?  NEWMAN  I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.  KRAMER  So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?  NEWMAN  (sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me! KRAMER  All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.   (Street)  George and Jerry, walking together. GEORGE  I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.  JERRY  You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural   little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em. GEORGE  Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know   about. JERRY  What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?  GEORGE  The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.  JERRY  So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!  (Monk's)  Elaine and Mr Lippman, sitting in a booth. LIPPMAN  It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and   if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. (laughs) ELAINE  Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.  LIPPMAN  Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.  ELAINE  Oh really, you like 'em? LIPPMAN  Uh huh. Very unusual. ELAINE  Well, you know what? (removes glasses)  LIPPMAN  What? ELAINE  (hands them over) You can have 'em.  LIPPMAN  Oh, no no no. (waves them away) Please.  ELAINE  No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em. LIPPMAN  Really? ELAINE  Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.  LIPPMAN  (accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.  ELAINE  They're from Malaysia. LIPPMAN  (putting on spectacles) Oh yeah? ELAINE  (admiring gasp) Fabulous.  (Courtroom)  Newman stands before a female Judge. Kramer stands beside him. There are the usual personnel for a courtroom. JUDGE  Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly for yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage...  Newman bursts into anguished tears. JUDGE  ...convenient to your home. NEWMAN  (sobbing) I can't afford that! JUDGE  Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded...  Newman's sobbing reaches new heights. JUDGE  ...and sold at auction. KRAMER  Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.   The judge peers at Kramer. She does not look impressed by this statement.   (Hair Team For Men)  George, Jerry and a Salesman, wearing a substandard toupee, are in a fitting room (?). George is sitting before a mirror, trying on a wig, assisted by the salesman, while Jerry looks on. GEORGE  (to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?  JERRY  (unimpressed) I, really can't say.  GEORGE  No, say. I want you to say. JERRY  It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid.   (to salesman) I'm sorry. SALESMAN  You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.  GEORGE  (examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.  JERRY  Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with? GEORGE  (to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.  SALESMAN  As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.  JERRY  Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!  SALESMAN  (getting annoyed) No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think you're being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life! JERRY  Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally! SALESMAN  (angry) All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?! (looks ready to punch Jerry) JERRY  All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.  GEORGE  (leaps to feet) Jerry! JERRY  I'm sorry. GEORGE  Please. (sits again)  The door opens and Gary enters. He's humming to himself. GARY  Hey Jerry, th... (spots George) George, you decided to get a rug! Good for   you, Jack! GEORGE  Well, I'm, I'm just looking. GARY  Oh. (to salesman) Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.  SALESMAN  I'll be right with you.  The salesman/Tommy leaves. GARY  Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you   that parking space. GEORGE  What? JERRY  What? GARY  This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight City Hall.  Jerry gives a questioning look to George, who responds with a 'go ahead' expression. JERRY  You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the   other day... GARY  (to George) You didn't?! GEORGE  (admiring himself in mirror) I did.  JERRY  (advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)   We see George continuing to admire himself as, off-camera, Gary and Jerry are heard struggling for possession of Gary's wig. GARY  (indistinct) I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!  JERRY  Gimme that thing!  (Monk's)  Typical number of customers. George enters, wearing his new toupee. One or two of the staff give him a glance. He looks around, and taps the counter by the cash register. A beautiful brunette sitting at the nearest table give him an admiring look. GEORGE  How's your life? All right? WOMAN  Yeah, not bad at all.  She pushes the chair opposite her out from the table in an invitation for George to sit down. George looks pleasantly surprised by the beneficial effects of his hairpiece.  (Press conference)  Mr Lippman and Jake Jarmel are on a small stage with a lectern. In front of it are a group of reporters and, amongst them sits Elaine. LIPPMAN  (at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour)  There is a brief ripple of applause as Jake steps up to take questions.  REPORTER  So Jake, what's your percentage on this book?   Several of the reporters laugh, as does Jake. Mr Lippman steps back to the lectern. He has some notes, and is extracting his glasses from his pocket.  LIPPMAN  Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...  JAKE  (notices glasses) Where did you get those?  LIPPMAN  ... as such, it... JAKE  Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?  LIPPMAN  (confused) Where... what? JAKE  (to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's   not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those!  He tries to pull them from Lippman's face, and a struggle ensues. Jake can be heard demanding the glasses. The reporters endeavour to get a view of the noisy fracas. Elaine rises and begins to make her way toward the exit. She is apologetic to her neighbour. ELAINE  (mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks. THE END>",

        "text": "   THE KISS HELLO Written by     Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld   (Comedy club) JERRY  Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird thing about it, is that people will touch other people's hair. You will actually kiss another human being, right on the head. But, if one of those hairs should somehow be able to get out of that skull, and go off on its own, it is now the vilest, most disgusting thing that you can encounter. The same hair. People freak out. (horrified) \"There was a hair, in the egg salad!\"   (Jerry's Apartment)  George sits on the couch with a newspaper, Jerry stands. GEORGE  Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You   think they do the flamenco? JERRY  I would think. GEORGE  So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for   Dinner and a flamenco? JERRY  (scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.  GEORGE  Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.  JERRY  Yeah? Would you do it? GEORGE  Yes, I think I would. JERRY  Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the   dance of a very proud people.  The phone rings. Jerry answers. JERRY  Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.   He hangs up the phone. JERRY  I have to go over to my grandmother's.  GEORGE  What for? JERRY  I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.  GEORGE  So, what, no lunch? JERRY  No, we have time. GEORGE  Oh. How's she doing?  George rises, and he and Jerry collect their jackets and make their way   to the door. JERRY  Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has   Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.  GEORGE  Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.  JERRY  Like toothpaste? GEORGE  Ya-hah.  Jerry and George leave.  (Street)  Jerry and George stroll along, continuing their conversation.  JERRY  There's a squeeze ketchup. GEORGE  I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.  JERRY  Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason   that they make squeeze ketchup? GEORGE  Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.  JERRY  I really don't see the difference.  GEORGE  Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.  JERRY  It's subtle. GEORGE  Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?  JERRY  (looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.  GEORGE  What?  They stop walking. JERRY  Ah, she's with her friend Wendy. GEORGE  Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?  JERRY  Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.  GEORGE  Really? JERRY  Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did   it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because   of it.  Jerry smiles and waves to Elaine, who is approaching with Wendy. Elaine   Waves back. ELAINE  (from a distance) Hey. GEORGE  You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.  JERRY  Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.  GEORGE  (surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for   anything. JERRY  No, I told you I admire your hearing.   George waves away the compliment. JERRY  No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.   Jerry and George walk and meet Elaine and Wendy. Wendy greets Jerry   with a kiss on the cheek, which he's not happy about. Wendy is attractive, but has   a real old-fashioned fifties-style hairdo. ELAINE  (to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.   Wendy and George shake hands. GEORGE  You're uh, physical therapist, right?  WENDY  Yes. GEORGE  You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his   sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?   Wendy takes a brief glance at George's proffered limb. Elaine isn't   happy that George is bothering Wendy. ELAINE  (warning) George. WENDY  Have you tried heat and ice on it?  GEORGE  (reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.  WENDY  Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for   you a little. GEORGE  (happy) Oh! Okay. WENDY  Let me give you my card.  Wendy fishes in her bag and hands a card to George. GEORGE  Oh, thank you. WENDY  Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye   Elaine. ELAINE  Bye Wendy. I'm sorry. WENDY  Bye Jerry.  Wendy walks away down the street. JERRY  Bye. ELAINE  (slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?  GEORGE  What? ELAINE  (pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.   (Monk's)  George, Jerry and Elaine enter. GEORGE  I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.  ELAINE  She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal   with that outside of the office. GEORGE  Why not?  The trio sit down in a booth. ELAINE  Because, it is what she does. GEORGE  I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting   excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius   Unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money   are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed! ELAINE  George, you got a little something, right here.   Elaine indicates underneath George's nostrils. GEORGE  (wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so   important... JERRY  (adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my   last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.  ELAINE  Why? JERRY  Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I   don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but   one step at a time. GEORGE  (regarding the menu) What're you getting?  JERRY  (to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?  ELAINE  Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.  JERRY  She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You   Should say something to her. ELAINE  Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.  JERRY  Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like   that. ELAINE  Yeah. Hah. GEORGE  Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.  ELAINE  No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.  JERRY  What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come   out with it. ELAINE  (sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's   right. I'll bring her over to meet...  Kramer enters. ELAINE  (to Kramer) ...Kramer.  Kramer strolls over to the table. KRAMER  Hello, boys and girls. JERRY  Speak of the devil.  Kramer sits at the table. Elaine starts to peruse her menu, as Kramer   speaks to Jerry. KRAMER  Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.  JERRY  What for? KRAMER  Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby   of our building. JERRY  Why? KRAMER  So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna   be a lot friendlier. JERRY  (reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the   lobby. KRAMER  Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say \"Hey,   Carl!\" and he  says \"Hey, Jerry!\" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.  JERRY  (still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with   everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.  KRAMER  (to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do   you wear so much eye makeup? ELAINE  (to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just   fine.  (Nana's Apartment)  Leo is in the living room, speaking with Nana, who's in another room.  LEO  Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic   Squeeze containers?  There is a knock at the door. Leo opens it, to reveal Jerry.  LEO  (traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!  JERRY  Hello, uncle Leo! LEO  What're you doing here? JERRY  Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.  LEO  Yeah, me too.  Nana enters with a bottle of ketchup. NANA  Hello Jerry. JERRY  Hi Nana.  There's a brief pause, as Leo waits for something. LEO  Aren't you gonna kiss her hello? JERRY  Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course. NANA  Ha, well, here's the bottle.  Nana holds out the ketchup. LEO  (grabbing the bottle) I'll do it. JERRY  (also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.   Jerry and Leo begin to struggle for possession of the ketchup.  LEO  Give it to me. JERRY  Will you stop it. LEO  Jerry, will you give me the bottle?  JERRY  Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!  NANA  You should let Buddy open it. LEO  Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.   Leo hands the ketchup back to Nana. NANA  Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?  LEO  What fifty dollars? NANA  Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he   gave you a hundred, and you were supposed to give fifty dollars to your sister.   Nana walks away out of the room again. LEO  Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.   Jerry is staring at Leo, with an expression of suspicion. LEO  (laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your   mother fifty dollars.  Leo continues to force out laughter, and Jerry continues his look of   mistrust.  (Lobby, Jerry's Building)  Elaine and Jerry wait by the elevator. Jerry is speaking to the   building super. JERRY  I'm just not getting any hot water.  JULIO  Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your   shower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry.  JERRY  Thanks, Julio. JULIO  Awright.  Julio walks away as the elevator arrives. Jerry and Elaine step aboard.   (Jerry's Apartment)  Kramer is rooting through a drawer, searching for something. The door   opens and Jerry and Elaine enter. JERRY  Huh? KRAMER  (surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!  JERRY  What's going on here? KRAMER  (evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing. JERRY  (suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?  KRAMER  Oh, I, I need a pen. JERRY  What for? KRAMER  Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough   for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.  JERRY  (accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?  KRAMER  You got that straight. JERRY  I told you, forget it. KRAMER  Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't   have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if   you know their name! JERRY  You're robbing me. KRAMER  Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate   in my program.  Kramer heads out the door, but Elaine intercepts him. ELAINE  Wha... W.. Are you going home? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?  KRAMER  Why? ELAINE  No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.   Kramer smiles at this. He exits, but turns to flash the smile at Elaine   as he crosses the hall to his apartment. After Kramer goes into his place,   Elaine shuts the door of Jerry's apartment. JERRY  (removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?  ELAINE  Yeah, she'll be here any second. JERRY  Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer   Says something. You sure you wanna go through with this? ELAINE  Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her   hair.  The phone rings, and Jerry picks up. Elaine removes her coat.  JERRY  Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to   help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you   remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the   track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and   he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana   doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I   think you should. Okay, bye.  (The Seinfeld's Place, Florida)  Morty and Helen in the kitchen. Morty has a pencil and pad and a pocket   calculator out, doing some work. MORTY  Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to   Over fifty-three years? HELEN  Oh, Morty, please. MORTY  Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And   that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three   years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...  HELEN  Morty, will you stop it! MORTY  (determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!   (Jerry's Apartment)  Jerry by the kitchen. The buzzer sounds, and Jerry answers.  JERRY  Yeah? WENDY  Wendy. JERRY  Come on up.  Elaine enters from the bathroom. ELAINE  Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?  JERRY  No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first   opportunity to not kiss her hello. ELAINE  What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's   face? JERRY  It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in,   you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part   of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.  ELAINE  How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?  JERRY  Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.   There's a knock at the door. ELAINE  (indicating) That's her. That's her.   Jerry holds up his hands, indicating he wants a few seconds to prepare.   He goes to the refrigerator, and indicates Elaine should let Wendy inside.   Elaine opens the door and Wendy enters. ELAINE/WENDY  Hi/Hey.  Jerry has the door of the fridge open, and his head is inside the   appliance. JERRY  (muffled) Hi Wendy. WENDY  Oh, hi Jerry.  Wendy wanders over to the fridge. JERRY  (muffled) Would you like something to drink?  WENDY  Sure.  Jerry holds out his arm, with a bottle in his hand. JERRY  (muffled) There you go. WENDY  (taking the bottle) Ah.  Jerry starts to withdraw his head from the fridge, and Wendy is poised   for the kiss hello. But, just as he turns to face her, he opens the freezer   compartment and the door blocks her approach. Wendy walks away to the couch.  JERRY  Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.   Jerry peers around the edge of the door, to see if the coast is clear.   Finding  that it is, he closes the various doors of the fridge. JERRY  So, how's everything going? WENDY  Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other   day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me. JERRY  Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.   There is a clunk in the hallway, as of Kramer's door opening.  ELAINE  Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.   Jerry's door opens and Kramer enters. He's holding a polaroid camera.  KRAMER  Hey! Jerry!  Jerry turns at the call of his name, and Kramer fires off a quick shot.  JERRY  C'mon, that's not fair! KRAMER  I told you I was gonna get it. JERRY  No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.  KRAMER  (holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.  JERRY  (throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do   I care? ELAINE  Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.  KRAMER  Oh, hello. WENDY  (holds out her hand) Hi. KRAMER  (shaking hands) Yeah.  Kramer does looks at Wendy, and something intrigues him. He turns away,   Then back again, unable to take his eyes off her hair. KRAMER  (points) You know, I really like that hairdo.   Jerry and Elaine both look surprised and let-down by Kramer.  WENDY  (flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be   time for a change. ELAINE  (hopeful) Oh, you were? WENDY  Well, I... KRAMER  (interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no.   Nobody wears it like that. ELAINE  Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...  KRAMER  No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.  WENDY  Oh, well.  Kramer raises his camera to take a picture of Wendy and her hair.  WENDY  (laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.  Kramer presses the button and nothing happens. He turns the camera up,   to look at the front of it and it chooses to fire at that moment, dazzling   Kramer with the flash.  (Wendy's Car)  Wendy drives, Elaine in the passenger seat. WENDY  So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.  ELAINE  Oh, Kramer. WENDY  Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend? ELAINE  You wanna go out with him? WENDY  Well, why not? ELAINE  Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...  WENDY  What, is there anything wrong with him?   Elaine stares off for several seconds, with a faraway look in her eyes.  WENDY  Elaine? ELAINE  I'm just thinking about the question.   (ProFitness Physical Therapy Center)  George is at the counter with his cheque book. He's moving his wrist and   Lower arm, clearly much more comfortable. GEORGE  You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows   her stuff. (he writes out a cheque) RECEPTIONIST  (perky) She is super. Same time tomorrow.  GEORGE  (tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There   you go.  George heads for the door. The receptionist looks at George's cheque   and finds it's not up to scratch. RECEPTIONIST  Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty.  GEORGE  What for? RECEPTIONIST  Well, you cancelled on Tuesday, and our policy is   \"twenty-four hours notice, for all cancellations\". GEORGE  (agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my   mother to, to the chiropodist.  Wendy enters, carrying a file. She overhears. WENDY  What's the problem? GEORGE  (harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's   appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist. WENDY  Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.   Wendy walks out, into another room. GEORGE  (after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy!   (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy!  George heads for the door. RECEPTIONIST  So. Will you be here tomorrow? GEORGE  Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!   George leaves, slamming the door behind him.  (Lobby, Jerry's Building)  Kramer has covered one wall of the lobby with photographs of the   tenants. They're all labeled with the appropriate name in magic marker. Kramer   is just completing Jerry's name underneath the Polaroid he took earlier. Jerry   and Elaine enter from the street. KRAMER  Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?   Elaine seems generally positive, Jerry's not so enamoured, especially   by his own picture. JERRY  Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...   The Polaroid has caught Jerry with his mouth hanging open and his eyes   wide. It's not flattering in the slightest. JERRY  ...You can't put that picture up. KRAMER  Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to   get to  know one another.  The elevator opens and a guy (Steve) steps out. He points to Kramer.  STEVE  Hey Cosmo. KRAMER  Hey...  Kramer turns to the wall of pictures, searches around for the face and   then  points back. Steve makes his way to the door as Kramer speaks.  KRAMER  ...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see? ELAINE  Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.  KRAMER  (interested) Well, how do you do?  A woman (Mary) has entered from the street. She stands behind Jerry and   Looks through Kramer's gallery of tenants. MARY  Hello, (finds the right photo) Jerry.  JERRY  Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.  MARY  You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk   to each other. KRAMER  (keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?  JERRY  (not really) Yeah. MARY  Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?  JERRY  Oh, sure, yeah. MARY  Thank you.  Mary leans across and gives Jerry a quick kiss on the cheek, then makes   her way toward the door. Elaine is giggling gleefully at Jerry's discomfiture.  JERRY  Oh, no!  (Jerry's Apartment)  Jerry and Elaine enter. Jerry mad, and Elaine still giggling.  JERRY  You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!  ELAINE  (laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...  JERRY  What is so funny? ELAINE  Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)   The phone rings and Jerry picks up. JERRY  Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He   couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.  Jerry hangs up the phone, and turns to Elaine. JERRY  (aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!  ELAINE  Why? JERRY  (suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.   (Lobby, Jerry's Building)  Jerry is collecting his mail from his mailbox. A woman (Joan) enters   And immediately goes for the kiss hello. She's friendly and overfamiliar.  JOAN  Hi Jerry. (she kisses Jerry) Mmmwah.  JERRY  (not as eager) Hi Joan. JOAN  How you doing?  Jerry backs away toward the elevator. JERRY  Pretty good. JOAN  Just pretty good? Not great? JERRY  Okay, great. JOAN  Are you happy? JERRY  Oh, I'm delighted. JOAN  Okay. Have a nice day. JERRY  You too.  The elevator comes down, the door opens and another woman (Louise)   emerges, with a big friendly smile for Jerry. LOUISE  Hi Jerry.  Louise also kisses the less than happy looking Jerry. JERRY  Hi, Louise.  Louise walks on and the unhappy Jerry enters the elevator.  (Jerry's Apartment)  Jerry has just arrived with his mail. The door opens and Kramer darts   into the room. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Ah, well. Thank you very much! KRAMER  For what? JERRY  (agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like   Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long,   boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!  KRAMER  You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of   loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family. JERRY  Family? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle   Pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in   nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut   her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be   called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what   the consequences are.  As Jerry reaches the end of his emphatic declaration, Kramer takes   Jerry's head in his hands, leans in and plants a big kiss right on Jerry's lips.   Halfway through the kiss, the door opens and George half-enters. Kramer   releases Jerry, who stands bug-eyed with shock. George stands silently in the doorway,   he looks from Jerry to Kramer, with a thoughtful expression. Biting his lips,   George slowly backs out of the door and closes it behind him.   (ProFitness Physical Therapy Centre)  George enters, and the receptionist spots him. RECEPTIONIST  Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch   with you. Wendy can't make her appointment. GEORGE  What d'you mean? RECEPTIONIST  She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left   A message on your machine. You didn't get it? GEORGE  When did you leave the message? RECEPTIONIST  Few hours ago. GEORGE  (pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice   for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.  RECEPTIONIST  Look, Mister Costanza... GEORGE  Will that be cash, or cheque?  George gives an exaggerated wink.  (Wendy's Car)  Wendy driving into New York at night with Elaine as passenger. Elaine   is wearing much of her ski gear - woolly hat, with goggles on top of her head, and   there are ski poles on the back seat. WENDY  I am really glad I took the day off.  ELAINE  Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.  WENDY  Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.  ELAINE  Ugh, the hell with 'em.  Wendy and Elaine share a laugh. Wendy then starts to pull the car over   to the side of the road. ELAINE  What're you stopping here for? WENDY  I'm dropping you off. ELAINE  (pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.  WENDY  Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the   Way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one   way... ELAINE  Yeah, but it's only three blocks. WENDY  Right. It's only three blocks. ELAINE  (unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...   (Street)  Elaine struggles along the sidewalk at night with her ski gear in her   arms. She's not finding it easy fighting with the uncomfortable bulk of skis,   poles, boots, etc.. Eventually she drops the boots and, rather than pick them   up, simply kicks them along in front of her.  (Street)  Jerry and Elaine walk together. ELAINE  She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a   sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?  JERRY  Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.  ELAINE  I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as   if I was hitch-hiking and she says \"Well, this is as far as I can take you.\"  JERRY  I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car   With someone with a hairdo like that. ELAINE  I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I   pinched a nerve in my shoulder. JERRY  You should have her work on it for you.  ELAINE  Yeah, alright, I gotta go.  (Lobby, Jerry's Building)  Jerry enters his building. Mary spots him from across the lobby and   closes for a kiss hello. MAR  Hi Jerry. JERRY  Hi Mary.  Jerry backs away from the kiss with so much effort that he's up against   The mailboxes. JERRY  Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry.   It's nothing personal....  Mary looks upset by Jerry's outburst. JERRY  ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it.   I'm sorry.  The door to the street opens and Louise enters, also friendly and   aiming for the kiss hello. LOU  Hi Jerry. JERRY  Hi Louise...  Jerry backs sharply away from Louise as she leans in for the kiss.  JERRY  ...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss   Hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it.   It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm   sorry.  Jerry backs into the elevator. JERRY  (as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.   (Jerry's Apartment/The Seinfeld's Place, Florida)  Jerry answers the phone. JERRY  Hello. HELEN  Jerry? JERRY  Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?   In Florida, Helen is on the phone and Morty is still working out   figures with a pad and a calculator. HELEN  Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.  MORTY  No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll   slip up. HELEN  Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.  JERRY  Okay, I will. MORTY  D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund   For fifty-three years...  (Hall Outside Jerry's Apartment)  Jerry and Kramer emerge from their apartments. KRAMER  What's up? JERRY  (locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing   home. KRAMER  Oh.  They walk together down the hall.  (Lobby, Jerry's Building)  The elevator doors open and Jerry and Kramer come out. Something on the   Wall opposite catches Jerry's eye. JERRY  Hey, Kramer, look at this.  Jerry points and walks over to Kramer's gallery, Kramer following.  JERRY  Look at my picture!  The photograph has been crudely vandalised with a magic marker.   'Grade-A Dork' has been written on the forehead, whiskers, spots, horns and a wormlike   tongue added and teeth blacked out. JERRY  I've been defaced! KRAMER  Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.   Behind Kramer a guy (Jack) has entered the building. Jack walks up   behind Kramer and slaps him on the shoulder in a friendly fashion.  JACK  Hey. Hi Cosmo. KRAMER  Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing? JERRY  Hi Jack.  Jack gives Jerry an unfriendly look and walks to the elevator without   replying. Julio comes out of the elevator, and Jerry walks over to ask him   something. JERRY  Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today,   You think? JULIO  Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to   people, huh? JERRY  (defensive) No no, that's not true!  JULIO  (accusing) Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld,   maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each   other.  Julio stalks away. Jerry swings to give Kramer a look.  (Knollridge Nursing Home)  Jerry is talking with a nurse on the porch. NURSE  Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.  JERRY  You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here,   Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.  NURSE  Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to   live next door to her. JERRY  Buddy? NURSE  Yes, that's his name. He's right over there.   The nurse indicates an elderly guy with a white moustache, wearing a   cap and reading a newspaper on a bench outside.  (ProFitness Physical Therapy Centre)  George is talking with Wendy at the counter. WENDY  (smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some   personal  business that day. GEORGE  (irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine.   Is that it? You're a delicate genius!  Behind George, Elaine has slipped in the door. WENDY  A delicate genius?  George spots Elaine. GEORGE  Elaine? ELAINE  (surprised) George!  George stalks past Elaine and exits. GEORGE  (leaving) Hah. Good luck. WENDY  What's going on? ELAINE  (feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when   You dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles   and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm.   Do you think you could give me some treatment? WENDY  Oh sure. You have insurance, right?  ELAINE  (shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?   Behind Elaine, George is standing in the open door GEORGE  Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the   counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a   mountain? WENDY  How did you hear that? GEORGE  I hear everything. WENDY  I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere,   hmm? ELAINE  Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.  GEORGE  Yeah. Let's go.  Elaine and George, united, head for the door. AS they get there, Elaine   turns to deliver her parting shot. ELAINE  (pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about   that hair. WENDY  Why, what's wrong with my hair? ELAINE  Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to   receptionist) Uh, tell her. RECEPTIONIST  She's right.  (Nursing Home)  Jerry and Buddy sit on the bench, reminiscing. JERRY  So you were with him that day at the track?  BUDDY  Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too.  JERRY  Leo? BUDDY  Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used   to steal my soda bottles. and cash 'em in for the deposits, uh?  JERRY  Is that so? BUDDY  And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a   Hundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I   tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took!  JERRY  Well, that's very interesting.  Just then, uncle Leo strolls up the path to the nursing home. Jerry   spots his arrival. JERRY  (standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours.   (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and   Grandpa at the track.  Leo's caught out, and looks worried. LEO  (defensive) One second... JERRY  (with a triumphant point) You're busted!   (Lobby, Jerry's Building)  Jerry enters from the street. Steve is in the lobby, collecting his   mail. Jerry decides to be friendly. JERRY  Hey, Steve. How you doing?  Steve turns to Jerry, gives him a disdainful look, and turns away   again. Another guy (Jeff) approaches from within the building. Jerry tries the   friendly approach again. JERRY  Hey, Jeff. What's happening?  Jeff completely blanks Jerry and goes to get his mail. Jerry spots Mary   over by Kramer's gallery wall, and walks across to her. JERRY  Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.  Mary moves to avoid Jerry. JERRY  Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!  MARY  (contemptuous) Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and   just get out of this building? (angry) Nobody wants you here. Nobody!   Jerry looks downcast. Mary walks over to the mailboxes, where she   greets Jeff and Steve. JEFF  Hi Mary. MARY  Hi Jeff. How are you?  Mary and Jeff kiss hello. MARY  Hi Pete. How you doing?  Mary and Pete kiss hello. PETE  Hey, let's go get some coffee. JEFF  Great idea. MARY  Oh, that'd be great.  The three of them exit together chatting happily, watched by a rueful   Jerry. Jerry looks at his photo on the wall and adjusts it so it's straight.   Then Jerry notices the elevator is about to go up, so he asks a favour of the   occupant as  he crosses the lobby. JERRY  Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...   But Paul makes no move to hold the door, which shuts in Jerry's face.   (Hall Outside Kramer's Apartment)  Jerry, wearing a bathrobe and with a towel round his neck, knocks at   Kramer's door. Kramer takes a quick peek through the peephole, then opens the   door. KRAMER  Hi. JERRY  Hey. Could I use your shower? KRAMER  What, again? You took one this morning.  JERRY  (pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.  KRAMER  I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment)   Little problem. KRAMER  (leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?  KRAMER  No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's   terrible. No,  we're done.  A happy looking guy pushes his way past Kramer and out of the   apartment. GUY  I'll go get some more beer. KRAMER  Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of   those blue corn chips.  An attractive redheaded woman comes along the hallway. Kramer greets   Her approach. KRAMER  Hey. STEFANIE  Hi Cosmo. KRAMER  Hi. STEFANIE  (kisses Kramer hello) Mmmwah. KRAMER  Ooh, I like that. JERRY  (impressed) Who's that? KRAMER  Stefanie. 2-G. JERRY  Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.   Jerry tries to see around Kramer into his apartment. KRAMER  Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.  JERRY  (rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.   Kramer closes the door, and Jerry can be seen peering through the narrowing gap until it shuts.  THE END>",

JERRY  You stink. You know you stink. What is this?  ELAINE  Oh. My ballet tickets. JERRY  Oh. Your ballet tickets. ELAINE  Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?  JERRY  No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.  ELAINE  You know, I'm going as a beard. JERRY  A beard? ELAINE  Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably   gorgeous, of course he's gay. JERRY  Yes. ELAINE  So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's   afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.  JERRY  Why are you doing this? ELAINE  Swan Lake, at the Met.  Kramer enters. KRAMER  Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.  ELAINE  Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?  JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?  KRAMER  I think he looks fantastic. ELAINE  Oh, come on. KRAMER  No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.   George enters, wearing a toupee. GEORGE  Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.  ELAINE  You look ridiculous in that thing.  GEORGE  Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?  ELAINE  Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.  GEORGE  Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with   my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the   coifed. I'm a player. KRAMER  You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this   morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can   go out with her. JERRY  Well what about me? KRAMER  No I think he's got you beat buddy.  GEORGE  So she's gorgeous. KRAMER  Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.  GEORGE  Well have you got a picture? KRAMER  No. GEORGE  Well, I have to see her. KRAMER  Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a   composite artist. GEORGE  Really? KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.  GEORGE  Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?  KRAMER  Yeah, yeah. I think he will. JERRY  It sounds like an excellent idea. KRAMER  Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.   Jerry, George, and Kramer walking down the street. GEORGE  Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.  KRAMER  Here you go brother. Some food for you.  HOMELESS MAN  Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you.  KRAMER  Now are you going to be here in an hour?  HOMELESS MAN  Where am I going?  (commercial)  At the police station. KRAMER  Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?  LOU  Almond? KRAMER  Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.  GEORGE  Pouty? I like that. JERRY  You can't go wrong with pouty. GEORGE  I'm excited about the pouty. LOU  All right I think that about does it.  KRAMER  All right George, come on, take a look.  GEORGE  Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.  JERRY  Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?  LOU  Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet her?   Walking down the street. GEORGE  Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?  JERRY  Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.  KRAMER  Hey, man. Enjoy the food? HOMELESS MAN  Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that?  KRAMER  Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.  HOMELESS MAN  I don't think so. KRAMER  Woah, woah, that's mine. HOMELESS MAN  You gave it to me. KRAMER  No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.  HOMELESS MAN  You should have said something. KRAMER  I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.   At the ballet. ROBERT  I've really got to thank you for this.  ELAINE  Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.  ROBERT  Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.  BOSS' WIFE  So, um, you and Robert. ELAINE  Yes indeed. BOSS  I'm surprised. ELAINE  Really. Why? BOSS  No reason. ELAINE  Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if   you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his   sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in   watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just   come together to make him the very special guy that he is.  Robert comes back. ELAINE  Oh, hi honey.  Elaine grabs Robert and kisses him.  At Monk's. ELAINE  Oh it was such a great night. JERRY  And did they suspect anything? ELAINE  No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.  JERRY  And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.  ELAINE  Oh it was such a great night. Oh. JERRY  You said that already. ELAINE  Oh I did? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Oh. JERRY  Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?  ELAINE  He's incredible. JERRY  Yeah, but? ELAINE  Yeah, I know. JERRY  So? ELAINE  What? JERRY  Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?  ELAINE  Well it did occur to me. JERRY  You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget   about it. ELAINE  Why? Is it irrevocable? JERRY  Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.  ELAINE  We've got a good team. JERRY  Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.  ELAINE  Why can't he play for us? JERRY  They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.  ELAINE  We just got along *so* great. JERRY  Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.  ELAINE  No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.  JERRY  You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.  ELAINE  I realize that. JERRY  Are you that desperate? ELAINE  Yes I am.  At Jerry's apartment. He is on the phone. JERRY  So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right   I'll see you then... Okay, bye.  Kramer enters. He goes into the kitchen and starts searching.  JERRY  What are you looking for? KRAMER  Tupperware. JERRY  Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.  KRAMER  I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because   I have no Tupperware. JERRY  What about a plastic bag? KRAMER  You must be kidding. JERRY  What is the difference? KRAMER  The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.   George enters. GEORGE  So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.  KRAMER  Oh yeah, you talked to her. GEORGE  Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.  KRAMER  Yeah well we go way back. GEORGE  Why didn't anything happen between you two?  KRAMER  Who's to say it didn't? JERRY  So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?  GEORGE  Yes I did. JERRY  What did you say to her? GEORGE  What do you think I said? JERRY  I don't know. GEORGE  I told her the truth. JERRY  As you see it? GEORGE  Yes, as I see it. JERRY  Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?  GEORGE  What hat? JERRY  You know, you're little hair hat there.  GEORGE  No. JERRY  Don't you think she could tell? KRAMER  No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.  JERRY  Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.  GEORGE  You only think that because you know me.  JERRY  Have you noticed people staring at your head?  GEORGE  I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.  JERRY  Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.  KRAMER  No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have   introduced him. GEORGE  Look, I guarantee she won't know. KRAMER  Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.  JERRY  Oh, I'll split a cab with you.  Walking down the street. KRAMER  Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.   Kramer drops something into the man's cup. HOMELESS MAN  Hey that's my coffee!  At the police station JERRY  Hi Sarge. TIERNEY  Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in   the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks? KRAMER  Sure. I will. TIERNEY  Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.   In the lineup room.  6 men stand there, one of which is Kramer. OVER THE SPEAKER  All of you, turn to the left.  Everyone turns left. Kramer turns right. OVER THE SPEAKER  The left.  Kramer turns left. OVER THE SPEAKER  Now turn to the right.  Kramer turns to the right doing a \"hokey pokey\" dance.  At Monk's. GEORGE  (thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.  DENISE  George? GEORGE  Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you. DENISE  Likewise. Have you been waiting long?  GEORGE  No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.  DENISE  Good, good. GEORGE  Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.   Camera is on George. Denise takes off her hat. The camera is still on George. His expression changes to surprise.   At the police station. JERRY  What's that? TIERNEY  A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test.  JERRY  Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?  TIERNEY  If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose   Place. JERRY  Really. TIERNEY  Have you ever seen the show? JERRY  No. TIERNEY  You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.  JERRY  I admit it. I don't watch it. TIERNEY  Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly.  JERRY  The poly? TIERNEY  Yeah. I think you've seen it.  At Jerry's apartment. ELAINE  Melrose Place? JERRY  Yes. Melrose Place. ELAINE  I just didn't know you watched that.  JERRY  Well I do. ELAINE  I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.  JERRY  Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.  ELAINE  You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...  JERRY  And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.  ELAINE  Why? Why were you so embarrassed? JERRY  The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.  ELAINE  That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?  JERRY  It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.  ELAINE  So what are you going to do? JERRY  I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.  ELAINE  Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?  JERRY  Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our   time. Who better to advise me?  Elaine takes a drink of something. ELAINE  Oh god this tastes terrible. JERRY  Did you shake it up? ELAINE  No. JERRY  You gotta shake it up. ELAINE  No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.   Jerry picks up the bottle and shakes it gently. JERRY  Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.  ELAINE  So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.  JERRY  So tonight are you going to make the move?  ELAINE  Yeah, I think I might.  George enters. JERRY  Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?  GEORGE  That's an interesting question. JERRY  How so? GEORGE  How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!  ELAINE  What do you mean bald? GEORGE  What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.  JERRY  She's bald? GEORGE  She's bald. ELAINE  Oh come on. GEORGE  Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his   head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.  ELAINE  Well maybe she got a haircut or something.  GEORGE  Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says \"Give me the Larry Fine.\"  JERRY  Women go bald? ELAINE  Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.   Kramer enters. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Hey. GEORGE  You fixed me up with a bald woman.   Kramer flinches. KRAMER  Bald? GEORGE  Yeah, that's right. ELAINE  Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.  GEORGE  So? ELAINE  (puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!  GEORGE  No I'm not. I *was* bald.  Elaine grabs at the toupee, George dodges the grab. GEORGE  Elaine.  Elaine grabs again and misses. George turns around and opens the door trying to get out. Elaine grabs the   toupee and runs to the window. GEORGE  No, no, no Elaine. ELAINE  (shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.   She tosses the toupee out the window. GEORGE  Nooooo.  He runs to the window, and the blind comes down on his head.   Outside.  The homeless man is walking down the street and sees the toupee. He puts it on.   At Elaine's apartment. ROBERT  Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?  ELAINE  Well I figured that's what couples do.  ROBERT  You almost convinced me we were a couple.  ELAINE  Well it was easy. Really. ROBERT  Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow.  ELAINE  Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?  ROBERT  Upstairs? ELAINE  Yeah. Upstairs? ROBERT  Elaine... ELAINE  I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?  ROBERT  Changing teams? ELAINE  Have you ever thought about it? ROBERT  But I'm a starting shortstop. ELAINE  Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.   At Monk's. GEORGE  I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to   me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a   pleasure. JERRY  Good to have you back. GEORGE  And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.  JERRY  She's as good as anybody else. GEORGE  Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.  JERRY  Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.  GEORGE  Going to need a little more coffee here.  JERRY  So George, how do I beat this lie detector?  GEORGE  I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.  JERRY  Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.  GEORGE  Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, \"Teach me to sing like you.\"  JERRY  All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.  GEORGE  Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.   Outside on the street. Jerry and Elaine walking toward each other.  ELAINE  Hey, I did it. JERRY  What? ELAINE  I turned him. He defected. JERRY  Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?  ELAINE  Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom-   boom. JERRY  Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said \"Too   bad he's gay\". ELAINE  Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot.   The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.  At the police station.  Kramer is in the lineup again. He and five other people walk into the room. They stand there for a few   moments. Kramer points with his eyes to the man on his left. He then tilts his head a few times to the man   on his left.  Elsewhere at the police station.  Jerry is hooked up to the polygraph. LOU  What's your name? JERRY  Jerry Seinfeld. LOU  What is your address? JERRY  129 West 81st street. LOU  Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby? JERRY  I don't know.  Camera shot on the polygraph. The pen moves back and forth on the paper.  LOU  Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?  JERRY  I don't know.  Camera shot on the polygraph. The pen moves back and forth on the paper. Lou and Sergeant Tierney   look at each other. LOU  Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? And if so, did she enjoy it?  JERRY  I don't know. LOU  Did Jane sleep with Michael again?  JERRY  (He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked   her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's   crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.   He picks up his coat and leaves.  At Jerry's apartment. JERRY  He went back? What do you mean he went back?  ELAINE  He went back. JERRY  I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.  ELAINE  Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what,   thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same   expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire   lives. JERRY  You can't. That's why they lose very few players.  ELAINE  Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.  JERRY  Well there's always a place for you, on our team.  ELAINE  Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?  JERRY  Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.  ELAINE  Okay.  George enters. JERRY  Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.  ELAINE  Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.  GEORGE  Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.  ELAINE  What is the matter? GEORGE  I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman   with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.  KRAMER  Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You   blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?  ELAINE  I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.  JERRY  All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.   Theme song of Melrose Place plays on the TV. JERRY  Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.   (commercial)  At the police station. Kramer is in the lineup. KRAMER  Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better   straighten up and fly right buddy boy. MAN  I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the   lineup? HOMELESS MAN  That's the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. The tall guy with the, with the high   hair. I'd recognize him anywhere. MAN  Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward.  KRAMER  Me?   THE END>",

        "text": "    THE DOORMAN Written by       Tom Gammill &amp; Max Pross   (Comedy club) JERRY  You remember a few years ago in New York, we had the doorman strike? They have a union, in the fancy buildings, and they went out on strike. Now you wouldthink, if any group of people would not wanna demonstrate what life would be like without them, it would be doormen. (as belligerent doorman) \"Let's see how they do without us!\" There's no doorman, people open the door, they walk in, it's... you know. Who's gonna walk out next? The guys who clean your windshield at the traffic light, with the dirty rag? (as window washer) \"We demand shorter yellows, and longer reds!\"   (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)  Jerry comes in from the street and walks toward the elevators. A doorman, stood reading a newspaper on a counter, objects. There's an undertone to the doorman's voice - unfriendly, contemptuous, even an edge of menace. DOORMAN  Whoah, whoah, whoah. (rises and turns to Jerry) May I help you?  JERRY  (indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.  DOORMAN  (unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward Jerry) No-one here by that name. JERRY  Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.  DOORMAN  Oh. House-sitting, mmm. JERRY  Yeah. DOORMAN  What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?  JERRY  Can I just go up? DOORMAN  Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.   The doorman wanders back to his newspaper. Jerry shrugs and pushes the button for one of the elevators. There's a pause as he waits for it to arrive. The doorman stands holding his paper, staring at Jerry, with the unfriendly smile on his face. Jerry throws a smile of his own back. The elevator is still not moving. Jerry tries to break the uncomfortable silence. JERRY  How 'bout those Knicks? DOORMAN  Oh, I see. On the sports page... JERRY  Yeah. DOORMAN  ...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.  Jerry turns away and looks at the indicator, hoping that the elevator will come and rescue him.  (Street)  George and Kramer walk along together. KRAMER  So, you think your parents'll get back together?  GEORGE  I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.  Kramer has noticed a 'Sightseeing Tour' bus on the street, with a German flag painted on the door. It gives him an idea. Kramer steps in front of George and brings them to a halt. KRAMER  Hey, George, stick 'em up. GEORGE  What? KRAMER  For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.  GEORGE  Why? KRAMER  So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real   New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.  Kramer pushes his hand deep into a pocket and raises his arm, giving the impression that he has a gun concealed beneath his coat. KRAMER  Awright, hands up, porky!  On the tourist bus, the occupants attention is attracted. They look out the window at the 'mugging'. George has his hands up, and Kramer is feeling through George's pockets with his free hand. KRAMER  That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!   The tourist are looking out of the bus. Shocked, they knock on the glass. Kramer grabs George by the collar of his jacket and is shaking him violently.  KRAMER  (aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!  GEORGE  Alright, that's enough. KRAMER  I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you   better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!  Kramer walks away. The tourists stare, horrified at what they've witnessed.   (Mr. Pitt's Apartment)  Elaine admits Jerry to the apartment. ELAINE  Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.   Elaine collects her bag, in readiness to leave. JERRY  I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.  ELAINE  What guy? JERRY  The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off? ELAINE  Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha. JERRY  Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?  ELAINE  (unhappy) I... JERRY  We'll still make the movie. ELAINE  (accepting) Okay, okay.  Jerry and Elaine sit on the couch to wait. They simultaneously look at their watches.  (George's Apartment)  George and Kramer wear their jackets, ready to leave. Frank is in a shirt, mixing a bowl (of kasha?) as they talk. GEORGE  What'd you do today, dad? FRANK  Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi. GEORGE  I don't have a hi-fi. FRANK  Didn't I give you my old record player?  GEORGE  (leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.  FRANK  Cosmo? Who's Cosmo? KRAMER  I'm Cosmo. FRANK  Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.  KRAMER  (little dance) One-two, cha-cha-cha.  GEORGE  (coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?  FRANK  (putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt.   George and Kramer stand together, by George's computer. Frank unfastens his shirt and opens it. Kramer and George turn and see Frank's torso exposed as the shirt comes off. Kramer's eyebrows go up in surprise. George looks horrified, and puts his hand to his mouth like he's going to vomit.  (Mr. Pitt's Apartment)  Elaine still sits on the couch. Jerry is standing at the window, holding the curtain open and looking down at the street. ELAINE  Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.  JERRY  Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.   The phone on Mr. Pitt's desk rings. Jerry is nearer, so he moves to answer it.  ELAINE  No, don't... JERRY  (picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.   Elaine looks exasperated. ELAINE  (quietly) Give that to me. ELAINE  (taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?   Mr. Pitt sits in a comfortable chair in Scotland. MR. PITT  (concerned) Elaine, are you having a party?  ELAINE  A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.   Jerry is peering out of the window again. JERRY  Alright, he just left. We can go. MR. PITT  (stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.  ELAINE  Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh,   can you grab those empty bottles for me.  Jerry picks up a paper sack of empty bottles from the floor by the desk.  MR. PITT  I need to know what's in the mail.  ELAINE  Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie. MR. PITT  (resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail. ELAINE  Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go.   Jerry gives an irritated glance upwards and goes to leave.  (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)  Jerry emerges from the elevator (without the bottles). There is a new doorman on duty, who gives Jerry a friendly nod and smile and holds the door open for him. Jerry nods and smiles back, and leaves.  (Mr. Pitt's Apartment)  Elaine is kneeling with the phone. She has Mr. Pitt's mail spread out on the floor in front of her and is going through it for Mr. Pitt's benefit.  ELAINE  ...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...  MR. PITT  (piqued interest) Oh, who's on the cover?   (Street)  Jerry walks down the street. He passes a doorway, where stands a familiar figure. The doorman still has the attitude problem. DOORMAN  Hey, buddy. JERRY  (surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too? DOORMAN  Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. (supercilious) No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?  JERRY  So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and   stand outside your own building? DOORMAN  You got a problem with that? JERRY  Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you.   Goodbye.  Jerry walks away. DOORMAN  (calling after Jerry) You really think you're better than me, don't you?!  (Monk's)  George and Kramer sit one side of a booth, facing Jerry. George is wearing a purple shirt. Kramer's eating a sandwich heartily. George looks as if he might never want to eat again. GEORGE  My father opened his shirt... JERRY  Yeah, and? GEORGE  (nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer.  KRAMER  (matter of fact) He had breasts.  George nods, Jerry has a confused expression. Kramer keeps on eating. Jerry thinks for a moment, George can't even look anyone in the eye.  JERRY  What d'you mean, breasts? GEORGE  (waves his hands) Big breasts! JERRY  So what? A lot of older men have that.  KRAMER  No, not these. These were real hooters.   Jerry pulls a face at the thought. GEORGE  I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.  KRAMER  Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.  GEORGE  (worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father   like son? JERRY  But, your father's not bald. GEORGE  No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your   grandfather. JERRY  Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.   George snaps his finger and points, in agreement with Jerry. He continues to look deeply worried. KRAMER  You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support. GEORGE  You mean like a bra? KRAMER  A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men. JERRY  Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?  KRAMER  I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.   Kramer leaves. A buxom blonde woman in a purple shirt is making her way to the door, as she passes the booth she notices George. BUXOM WOMAN  (indicating her shirt with her finger) Hey, we're twins.  GEORGE  (thinking she means the breasts) What!!  BUXOM WOMAN  Our shirts. They're the same. GEORGE  Oh, Huh, imagine that.  The woman smiles and leaves. Elaine enters Monk's and comes over to Jerry. She's not happy about something. ELAINE  (to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?  JERRY  What? Nothing. ELAINE  (sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started   harassing him. JERRY  What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks? ELAINE  Hey, did you make the movie? JERRY  No. ELAINE  You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.  JERRY  Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?  ELAINE  Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?  JERRY  Yes, we do.  Elaine looks over at George, wondering what he's doing. George is holding the neck of his shirt open, and is peering down the inside of the garment at his chest. As Elaine and Jerry watch, George jiggles his upper body, to see if there's any movement. ELAINE  What is wrong with George? JERRY  He's... trying to get something off his chest.   George ends his experiment, and rises to leave. He digs in his wallet to pay the cheque. GEORGE  (agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off   my hands.  (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)  Jerry enters from the street, only to find the unpleasant doorman standing inside the lobby. The doorman's demeanour hasn't improved. DOORMAN  Help you? JERRY  (jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be   gone. DOORMAN  I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world. JERRY  (trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have   a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends. DOORMAN  You wanna be friends? JERRY  I'd like to be. DOORMAN  Then watch the door for a minute, would you?   The doorman swaps places with Jerry, putting Jerry beside the counter.  JERRY  What? DOORMAN  Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.  JERRY  Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?  DOORMAN  It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his hat) Here. (putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that. JERRY  Oh.  The doorman goes out the door. Jerry takes off the hat, which he's not thrilled about wearing, and leans on the counter. The doors of an elevator open, and a young woman pushing a baby buggy emerges and heads for the exit. After a second, Jerry realises his job. He puts on the hat and opens the door to allow the woman to leave. AS he opens the door, a man enters and strolls past Jerry into the elevator vacated by the woman. JERRY  (to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!   The man takes no notice of Jerry, the doors close. The street door opens and another, older guy, enters. Jerry moves and challenges him.  JERRY  Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?  MR. GREEN  (indignant) Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years. Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested.   Jerry steps aside and motions for the guy to carry on into the building, but he looks resentful about it. JERRY  (after the guy) You think you're better than me?   (Bus)  George is riding the bus. As the vehicle travels along the street, it rattles, shakes and shudders like all poorly maintained public transport. George is strap-hanging, and he gets a worried look as he feels there might be some movement on his chest. He puts his hands on his chest, then notices another guy on the buss looking at him. Self-consciously, George pulls his coat tight shut, and crosses his arms firmly.  (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)  Jerry is standing behind the counter, reading the doorman's newspaper. A FedEx delivery guy enters with a package, lays it on the counter and scans a barcode on it with a little device he takes from his pocket. Jerry watches,   disinterested. There is a brief pause, as the FedEx guy waits for something.  DELIVERY GUY  (indicating) You have to sign for it.  JERRY  Oh, right.  Jerry takes the FedEx guy's pen and signs for the package, then goes back to the newspaper. DELIVERY GUY  (with a smile) Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?   Jerry gives the guy a hostile look, much as the doorman might.  JERRY  (dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The FedEx guy leaves, looking a touch unhappy at Jerry's attitude. Jerry puts the paper down, and goes to have a look through the door. There's no sign of the doorman, so Jerry tosses the hat onto the counter, dismissing it with a wave of the hand as he moves to the elevator.  (George's Apartment)  Frank opens the door, to reveal Kramer, carrying a large portable record player.  KRAMER  Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.  FRANK  Thank you, Kramer. KRAMER  Yeah. FRANK  (indicating a chair) Put it over there.   Kramer dumps the record player on the chair. Frank goes to the couch, not moving very easily. KRAMER  So, how you feeling? FRANK  Tired. KRAMER  Uh huh. Your back hurt? FRANK  How did you know? KRAMER  Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up   there. FRANK  (looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?  KRAMER  Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.  Kramer brings out a garment constructed of canvas and elasticated fabric.  FRANK  You want me to wear a bra?! KRAMER  No, no. A bra is for ladies.  Kramer holds the garment up to his own chest. KRAMER  Meet, the bro.  (Estelle's Car)  Estelle is driving a preoccupied-looking George. ESTELLE  So, is your father excited about coming home?   George is miles away. ESTELLE  George? GEORGE  (broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?  ESTELLE  All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?  GEORGE  Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots. ESTELLE  She was a lovely woman. GEORGE  Yuh. What about physically? ESTELLE  Physically? GEORGE  Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?  ESTELLE  Well, you've seen pictures. GEORGE  (to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.  ESTELLE  So what? GEORGE  Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?  ESTELLE  Big? No, just my height. GEORGE  Bosomy? ESTELLE  Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!  GEORGE  (trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant. ESTELLE  Where do you get your genes from?!  GEORGE  (to himself) That's what I'd like to know.   (Elevator, Mr. Pitt's Building)  Elaine and Jerry ride down. ELAINE  I can't believe you left your post.  JERRY  He left me there. You see the mind games?   The bell rings as they reach the lobby, and the doors open.   (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)  Elaine and Jerry emerge into the lobby to find four or five tenants standing around, and a uniformed cop taking notes. ELAINE  (to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?  TENANT 1  Somebody stole the couch out of the lobby.   Jerry and Elaine look shocked. TENANT 2  Where's the doorman? How come someone wasn't watching the door?  ELAINE  (quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.  JERRY  Yeah.  Elaine and Jerry depart the scene of the crime in some haste.   (George's Apartment)  Frank's cha-cha record is playing loudly on the record player. Frank and Kramer are half-dancing to the music, as Frank tries on the bro. Kramer stands behind Frank, making adjustments to the garment. The door opens and George and Estelle enter. They see the dancing twosome, and the undergarment, and look stunned.  ESTELLE  (shocked) Oh, my god!  George is frozen, staring. Kramer carries on dancing, behind a relatively unfazed Frank.  (Jerry's Apartment)  The lighting, with moonlight coming through the blinds, and Elaine's red dress, give a very noirish look to the scene. ELAINE  What were you doing watching the door anyway?  JERRY  He asked me to. We were getting along.  ELAINE  (thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep. JERRY  Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen?   Maybe he's setting me up! ELAINE  (taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight. JERRY  Alright, well what if we say... ELAINE  Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up... JERRY  I came to pick you up. ELAINE  Yeah. That's what I just said. JERRY  I know. I was just... ELAINE  Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.  JERRY  Alright, well. Just, start again, then.  ELAINE  Okay, you came to pick me up at...  JERRY  Right. ELAINE  You see? Again. JERRY  What? I said right.  Elaine give Jerry a look like he's an idiot. ELAINE  Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.  JERRY  But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.  ELAINE  (intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!  JERRY  But I don't know if this is gonna work.  ELAINE  (aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking! JERRY  Okay. ELAINE  Good. Now fix me a drink.  (George's Apartment)  Frank has his shirt back on, over the bro. KRAMER  How's that feel? FRANK  This feels very comfortable. KRAMER  You see? FRANK  I feel ten years younger. KRAMER  Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.   Frank walks a few paces. FRANK  And I can breathe easier, too. KRAMER  I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right? FRANK  Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.  KRAMER  (claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro. FRANK  Let's do it!  Kramer and Frank share an elaborate and forceful handshake.  FRANK  Except, we gotta do something about the name.  KRAMER  Why, what's wrong with bro? FRANK  No, bro's no good. Too ethnic. KRAMER  Alright, you got something better?  FRANK  How 'bout uh... the mansiere? KRAMER  Mansiere? FRANK  That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?   George enters, unhappy. He tosses his keys aside. GEORGE  (upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.  FRANK  Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?   George looks down at the floor for a few seconds. GEORGE  Dad. We need to talk.  (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)  The unpleasant doorman is being grilled by a severe looking Mrs. Payton.  DOORMAN  I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.  Behind Mrs. Payton, Elaine enters from the street and strolls to the elevator.  MRS. PAYTON  Why should I believe you? DOORMAN  (indicating Elaine) Actually, it was her friend.   Elaine turns as she hears this, and Mrs. Payton goes to talk to her. Elaine looks a tad worried at first but, of course, she has a plan.  MRS. PAYTON  I was just speaking to the doorman here, about the couch robbery.   The doorman peers over at the conversing ELAINE  Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman   say? MRS. PAYTON  He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.  ELAINE  (dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination,   doesn't he?  Meanwhile, the doorman has discovered something behind the counter. He brings out the FedEx package Jerry signed for and carried it toward Mrs. Payton.  DOORMAN  Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package (handing the package to Mrs. Payton) at the exact same time the couch was stolen.  Mrs. Payton and the doorman both look at Elaine. Elaine looks sick, as she's caught out. ELAINE  (in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know   how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.  The doorman walks silently away with the package and a quiet smile of triumph.  ELAINE  (desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.  The doorman stands behind his counter, smiling at Elaine's discomfiture.   (Monk's)  Jerry and a downcast George sit one side of a booth, with an animated Elaine facing them. JERRY  You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?  ELAINE  (worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it. JERRY  (livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one! ELAINE  Is it possible we were victims of a sting?  JERRY  I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.   Jerry stares off, as he imagines...  (Jerry's Imagination)  In the lobby of Mr. Pitt's building, a bunch of doormen stand around the unpleasant doorman, laughing at his tale. DOORMAN 2  So, you didn't even (indistinct) watch the couch?  DOORMAN  No. I was just messing with his head.  DOORMAN 2  And they think they're better than us?   The doormen whoop it up again  (Monk's)  Jerry has an expression of pure hatred for all doormen. ELAINE  Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?  Jerry snaps back to the here and now. ELAINE  We have to replace the couch. JERRY  Now we have to buy a new couch?!  A thought occurs to George. GEORGE  (crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?  JERRY  The one with the Poppie stain?! GEORGE  Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out. ELAINE  But it's got a pee-stain on it. GEORGE  No, the cushion's turned over. ELAINE  (not sure) I guess. GEORGE  (enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!  (Sid Farkus' Office)  Sid Farkus sits behind his desk, in front of which sit Kramer and Frank. Kramer is holding his invention as they pitch it to Farkus. KRAMER  Now, it's called the bro. FRANK  Or, the mansiere. KRAMER  Yeah, but I prefer the bro. FRANK  I like mansiere.  Kramer puts the bro on the desk. FARKUS  Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea.  KRAMER  Yeah. FARKUS  You know, selling bras exclusively to women, we're really only utilising   fifty percent of the market. FRANK  (to Kramer) That's what we figured, huh?  KRAMER  (to Frank) I told you. FARKUS  And, to be perfectly frank, I've always felt I could use some support. I know, when I'm wearing Banlon, there appears to be some jiggling.  FRANK  (vehement) I wouldn't be caught dead in Banlon.   Kramer shakes his head at the very thought of Banlon. FARKUS  (indicating the bro) So uh, what d'you see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What? KRAMER  Uh. FRANK  Definitely velcro.  Farkus gives a questioning look to Kramer. KRAMER  Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.  The three of them chuckle at the thought. KRAMER  I think we've all experienced that.   They share a manly laugh. FARKUS  Summer nights.  The laughter continues for a moment. KRAMER  (pointing at Farkus) Very funny. FARKUS  Well, I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont...  KRAMER  Of course, yes. FARKUS  ...But, barring any unforeseen developments, gentlemen, I think we're sitting on a winner.  Farkus offers his hand. Kramer shakes, and then takes his prototype and moves toward the door. Frank then shakes Farkus' hand. FARKUS  (sympathy) Frank, I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating.  Kramer hovers behind Frank, waiting to leave. FRANK  Oh, thank you, Sid, but that's all in the past. I'm ready to move on.  FARKUS  (thoughtful) I've always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh, I hope you don't think uh, this is out of line, but would it be okay with you, if I were to ask her out? FRANK  (anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve   to ask me something like that?! FARKUS  Oh, no, Frank, I was just saying...   Kramer tries to calm Frank down. FRANK  I know what you're saying, and I know what you're thinking!!  FARKUS  No, Frank... FRANK  C'mon, Cosmo, I'm not doing business with this guy.   Frank storms out in a rage. Kramer gives Farkus an 'I'll calm him down' look and follows Frank out the door. KRAMER  Frank!  (George's Apartment)  Frank and Kramer have just arrived, to find George packing a suitcase.  GEORGE  Jerry took the couch back. FRANK  He took it back? Didn't you tell him I was using it?  GEORGE  Oh, I pleaded with him. FRANK  Where am I supposed to sleep? GEORGE  Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming   to get you. KRAMER  I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?   George waves at Kramer to shut the hell up. FRANK  What stain? KRAMER  Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.   George bites his lip and shakes his head. FRANK  (disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch?  GEORGE  (light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.  FRANK  (anger) But, the very idea. you had me lying in urine!!   George flashes Kramer an aggrieved look. There is a knock at the door.  GEORGE  Ah! There's mom, there's mom.  George races over and opens the door. ESTELLE  Is it safe to come in? GEORGE  Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.  ESTELLE  You're not having any of your transvestite parties?  FRANK  Will you stop it? ESTELLE  (to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years, I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!   As Estelle speaks, Frank goes into the bedroom and brings out the record player.  FRANK  Here, Cosmo... KRAMER  Oh, hey. FRANK  ...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I don't need it now...  KRAMER  Awright, I got it. FRANK  ...I got one at home.  George is helping Frank on with his coat, a happy smile beaming from his face.  ESTELLE  Alright, let's go.  Kramer opens the door. FRANK  We'll go out for dinner tonight. ESTELLE  I can't tonight, I'm busy. FRANK  What d'you mean, busy? ESTELLE  I'm having dinner with someone. FRANK  With whom?  George drapes the coat across Frank's shoulders. ESTELLE  Sid Farkus. FRANK  (anger) Sid Farkus?! You're not having dinner with a bra salesman.   George has picked up Frank's three suitcases, and is all ready to help carry them out to the car. ESTELLE  Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.  FRANK  Okay, that's it! I'm not coming home!   Frank sits down in a chair. George's face drops. GEORGE  (upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!  FRANK  We'll work something out.  George drops the cases in disappointment.  (Street)  The German sightseeing bus comes to a halt at the kerb. Kramer comes around the corner, carrying the record player in his arms. An elderly woman, one of the witnesses to the 'mugging' of George, recognises Kramer as he passes. She climbs out of the bus and points after Kramer. GERMAN WOMAN  Stop him! Ja, ja, ja, it's him!  Kramer looks back at the sound and sees the woman coming after him. He turns back and continues walking. The other German tourists get off the bus and join the woman as she follows Kramer. GERMAN WOMAN  Stop that man! It's him.  Kramer looks worried and continues to carry his record player, pushing past bystanders as the tourists close on him. GERMAN WOMAN  Somebody, stop him! Please, quick. Stop, it's him. I know, I know. Help. Stop him.  Kramer dives into a doorway, but the doors are locked, so he's trapped by the tourists, who block his escape. HORST  Hey, hey. (pointing) That record player is not yours.  KRAMER  Now, look. Somebody gave it to me.  HORST  You're a thief. We have proof.  Horst spots the straps of the bro hanging from Kramer's pocket.  HORST  What is that?  Kramer puts down the record player and brings out the bro. He holds it up against his body, to illustrate his words. KRAMER  The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.  One of the tourists nudges another, portlier, tourist on the shoulder at Kramer's explanation. HORST  How does it connect in the back? With a hook?  KRAMER  Oh, no, no. (demonstrates) Here, velcro.   The portlier German reaches for Kramer's bro. The tourists are all looking much more jovial. HORST  (to the portly German) Ooh, (indistinct German) ...keine problem, ah?   The tourists laugh uproariously, with Kramer joining in, and the portly German holding the bro up to himself. HORST  Is gut, ja?  (Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)  Jerry and Elaine have just dropped off the couch into the lobby. Mrs. Payton regards it critically. The doorman stands in the background as the delivery men leave. MRS. PAYTON  Well, I suppose it'll have to do. ELAINE  It's a beautiful couch. JERRY  It's hardly been used.  Elaine and Mrs. Payton walk away together. An elevator arrives, and a familiar character steps out and is noticed by Jerry. JERRY  Poppie! POPPIE  Oh, hello, Jerry. JERRY  What're you doing here? POPPIE  Visiting my friend. JERRY  Ohh. Hey, how you feeling? POPPIE  Oh, much better, much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation. JERRY  Hmm. POPPIE  So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend.  Poppie holds his hands out, indicating someone of Elaine's height. Jerry nods, remembering and in sympathy. POPPIE  She start the big fight, about abortion.   Elaine comes back over to Jerry and the couch. Poppie spots her approach, and is not happy. POPPIE  It's you! It's you! ELAINE  Wha...? POPPIE  You! I... I gotta sit down!  Poppie, aggravated, moves toward the couch. JERRY  No, Poppie! No!!  Poppie sinks onto the couch, despite the pleas, and horrified expressions, of Jerry and Elaine.  (George's Apartment)  George sits up in bed reading a magazine. Frank enters, carrying a small bowl. George puts his magazine to one side, as Frank carefully climbs into bed whilst keeping hold of the bowl. George takes off his glasses, as Frank settles back. Picking up a spoon from the bowl Frank is about to eat, when a thought occurs. Carefully, Frank reaches over with the spoon, to offer George a taste.  FRANK  Kasha?  George looks disdainfully at the spoonful. A few morsels have fallen onto the bedclothes, George picks them up and puts them back into Frank's bowl.  GEORGE  No. Thanks, dad.  Wearily, George puts his glasses on the bedside table, and switches off his bedside lamp, bringing darkness to the room. George shuffles down beneath the bedclothes, to get comfortable, just as Frank switches  on his bedside lamp. Exasperated, George lifts his pillow and places it over his own face, as Frank continues to eat his kasha.  THE END>",

        "text": "  THE JIMMY Written by       Gregg Kavet &amp; Andy Robin   (The New York Health Club. Jerry, Kramer and George are getting dressed)  GEORGE  That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What   was his name again? JERRY  Jimmy GEORGE  Jimmy, right.

GEORGE  Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya.  KRAMER  Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay   with me. They (?) Jerry.

The muscle has to grow....or die.  GEORGE  (to Jimmy) Wh...Where d'you get'em?  JIMMY  Jimmy sells'em. GEORGE  You sell them? JIMMY  Oh yeah! But Jimmy's all out right now. Moving to Manhattan set Jimmy back a bit.  GEORGE  Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in.  JIMMY  All right GEORGE  All right Jimmy Good talking to ya.  JIMMY  Jimmy'll see you around.  Jimmy leaves. GEORGE  What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing.  JERRY  Why. You took a shower? GEORGE  Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take. Ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again, I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!  KRAMER  You should take cold showers. GEORGE  Cold showers? They're for psychotics.   Kramer Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh. GEORGE  All right, I'll see you guys later.  JERRY  Aw right. KRAMER  So, you're heading home? JERRY  No...Got dental appointment. KRAMER  Ah! what.. Tim Whatley? JERRY  Yeah! KRAMER  Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday.  JERRY  Oh! How d'you like that? KRAMER  You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the   dentist. JERRY  I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery.  KRAMER  Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength.   Kramer leaves. Jerry is speechless. SCENE TWO  Meeting at Yankee Stadium. WILHEM  I called this meeting because we......have........a problem. For   the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from the   club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases,   batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big one.    The camera goes back and forth from Wilhem to George who keeps pulling on   his collar he's sweating. WILHEM  They took a pitching machine, a batting cage ,the in-field tarp and   all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to   believe it's an inside job. GEORGE  (still puffing)Whoa!! WILHEM  If anybody here knows anything about it I recommend strongly   that...you come forward.  Wilhem looks at George who's sweating so much it seems he's hiding   something.  Scene cuts to Tim Whatley's dental office. RECEPTIONIST  Dr Whatley's running a little late. If you'd like to take a   seat, I'll call you when he's ready. JERRY  All right.  Jerry sits down and browses through the magazine on the table and   discovers Tim has Penthouse magazines for patients to read.   Scene then switches to Jerry's apartment. Elaine is on the phone.  ELAINE  Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye.  ELAINE  (to Jerry) Hey ! You want to go see The Velvet Fog.  JERRY  The Velvet fog? ELAINE  Yeah! Mel Tormé, That's his nickname.  JERRY  What the hell his a velvet fog. ELAINE  Do you wanna go or not? JERRY  Well , where is it?. ELAINE  He's performing at this AMCA benefit.  JERRY  AMCA? ELAINE  Able Mentally Challenged Adults JERRY  Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song.  ELAINE  What are you..crazy? JERRY  They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing.  ELAINE  Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that   ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health   club.? JERRY  I don't think so. ELAINE  Yeah yeah!

They want to see that you can read   an unpublished work and give insightful criticism. ELAINE  Oooh!! JUDY  Read it twice if you have to. This is a big step in your career.  ELAINE  Yeah! hmmm..I gotta go.. JUDY  Hey! What about lunch? ELAINE  (she leaves hurriedly) I gotta gooo...   Catches up with Jerry on the street. ELAINE  Thank god I found you.. JERRY  Oh! Hey! ELAINE  You still got that Fedex? JERRY  Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.  ELAINE  No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)   Jerry's place . There is a sign on the door that says \"Fumigation Do not enter\"  JERRY  You see? ELAINE  Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..  JERRY  I told you to take it. ELAINE  Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...  JERRY  Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.   Kramer comes out of the apartment. KRAMER  I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.  JERRY  Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.  KRAMER  Toxic gas!!! JERRY  Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.  KRAMER  An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.  ELAINE  My manuscript? JERRY  How do you feel? KRAMER  Now that you mention it , a little woozy.  ELAINE  Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.  KRAMER  I'm not going back in there!! ELAINE  all right then, where is it?? KRAMER  I left it on the coffee table or somethin'  JERRY  Well wh..wh.what are you doing? ELAINE  I'm going in . JERRY  Didn't you see the sign on the door?  KRAMER  Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.   Elaine breathes heavily does the sign of the cross and enters. She goes to the coffee   table then looks underneath the couch and finishes by his desk then the dinner table.   She runs out of air so she has to rush out. ELAINE  ( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?  KRAMER  Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...  ELAINE  Okay... bathroom....kitchen. JERRY  Can you get me a soda?  Elaine goes back in KRAMER  Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.   Elaine searches the kitchen , then the couch cushions and gives up.  ELAINE  (again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?  JERRY  I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.  ELAINE  I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers.   I couldn't.... JERRY  Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?  ELAINE  Yeah! JERRY  Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!!   I've got him.  Newman's door . Jerry knocks JERRY  Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.  NEWMAN  Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.  JERRY  There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..  NEWMAN  Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...  JERRY  Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman   is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)  NEWMAN  So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in   squaller.(?) JERRY  You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch.   Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter   how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin.   Up your legs , up your spine , up your back..... NEWMAN  (Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm ripped with fleas ( scratches   furiously)  Plaza Hotel, Morty is getting a massage. MORTY  Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but I'm telling ya   he's worth every penny OOOOHH! HELEN  I'm next. MORTY  Hey! Leo, get this, four movies at once; Pay Per View.  LEO  I love these nuts. NANA  This Champagne's gone flat. ( throws her glass over her shoulder)  HELEN  Nana!!! NANA  He Ha Ha Ha...Let the chambermaid clean it up   On the street in front of a flower shop GEORGE  Hello.. PAULA  What's the matter?... GEORGE  Well I spoke to Elaine... PAULA  Hey! Look , no shave. GEORGE  No...Why should that make any difference to you?  PAULA  It doesn't.. GEORGE  Of course not. You don't care what I look like.  PAULA  That's right I don't. GEORGE  I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?  PAULA  Not a wit. GEORGE  Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that   would be fine too. PAULA  You can wear sweatpants. GEORGE  I could.. PAULA  (seductively) You could drape yourself in velvet, for all I care.  GEORGE  Velvet...  Monks ELAINE  Did you read the whole thing? KRAMER  Oh! yeah. ELAINE  Huh . So What's it about? KRAMER  Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.  ELAINE  unbridled enthusiasm...? KRAMER  Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.  ELAINE  Oh! boy. KRAMER  You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist,   who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.  ELAINE  Oh! my God. KRAMER  ah! Here we go. ELAINE  (to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.  KRAMER  May I..( pointing her food) ELAINE  (feeling sick) Yeah! go ahead. KRAMER  what is this? ELAINE  What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)  KRAMER  I can't taste this. ELAINE  What are you talking about? KRAMER  This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas   from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)   At Shelley's JERRY  Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.  SHELLEY  Well, I don't keep pecans in the house so I didn't think it'd be a problem.  JERRY  ( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..  SHELLEY  What's the matter? JERRY  I forgot my toothbrush. SHELLEY  Oh! no problem.....You can use mine.  JERRY  Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.  SHELLEY  Brush now. JERRY  (long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)   Kramer and Newman who is coming out of the market eating a peach.  KRAMER  Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..  NEWMAN  What for, you got your own. KRAMER  Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.  NEWMAN  ( resumes eating) Well that's a shame.  KRAMER  Waited all year and I can't even taste it..  NEWMAN  You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them all to me.   At Viking Press. ELAINE  It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .  MANDEL  Unbridled enthusiasm. ELAINE  Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.  MANDEL  hmmm...interesting take. So you believe, has he not been so enthusiastic he could have adverted   disaster. ELAINE  Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a   cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.  MANDEL  So.. It was more a question of attitude than politics..  ELAINE  Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.  Plaza Hotel MORTY  Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?  LEO  No more nuts. Awrghh.....  Monks. George walks in wearing velvet. JERRY  Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!  GEORGE  It's the real deal. JERRY  She's seen you in this thing. GEORGE  That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time.   Well the search is over. JERRY  And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.  GEORGE  He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.  JERRY  Ahh! She threw me out. GEORGE  Why? JERRY  I wouldn't use her toothbrush. GEORGE  So where are you staying? JERRY  Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.   At Viking again. MANDEL  Three hours of massage time , twelve in-room movies including several adult features, five shoe   shines and four hundred dolars worth of snacks. Not to mention the damage to the room.  ELAINE  Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas , it could have killed   me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.  MANDEL  I think , you've read, one too many, Billy Mumphrey stories. Good day Miss Benes.  ELAINE  Okay...Good day..  Monks again.George comes in eating a Macanaw peach. PAULA  Hi George. GEORGE  (mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?  PAULA  Oh! yeah I love those. GEORGE  Too bad , it's all done.  Paula takes the pit and puts it in her mouth. George stares in disbelief , then disgust.   Kramer is about to lick an envelope he is about to send. KRAMER  ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?  PASSERBY  The fifteenth. KRAMER  Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...  NEWMAN  Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?  KRAMER  ( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.   (unleashes a dog)  Dog proceeds to chase after Newman  Finally at The Plaza Hotel ELAINE  (knocks) Hello is anybody here?.. LEO  They said they were sending an Asian woman.  ELAINE  Oh! my God.

        "text": "           THE FUSILLI JERRY Written by  Marjorie Gross   (Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building)  JERRY  I hear you're going out with David Putty.  ELAINE  Yeah. What, is it a problem? JERRY  Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.  ELAINE  Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.  JERRY  Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.  ELAINE  Oh, god. JERRY  The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.  ELAINE  Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.  JERRY  All right.  (At Monk's, George and Estelle are looking over their menus)  GEORGE  Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.  ESTELLE  So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.  GEORGE  You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.  ESTELLE  So, I'm getting an eye job. GEORGE  An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.  ESTELLE  Georgie, I'm a divorcee. GEORGE  No, you're not a divorcee. You're just separated. You're---you're a separatee.  ESTELLE  Well, I'm out there, George. GEORGE  No, you're not out there. ESTELLE  I am, too! GEORGE  You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!  ESTELLE  Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.  GEORGE  Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---  ESTELLE  This is the only time the doctor *has*.   (Kramer walks by their table on his way out) GEORGE  Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)  KRAMER  Hi, little buddy. GEORGE  Come on over and sit down. KRAMER  Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.  GEORGE  No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...  KRAMER  All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the   cheek) ESTELLE  So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.  KRAMER  Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're   out  there now. GEORGE  She's not out there! KRAMER  So, who is your doctor? ESTELLE  Uh, Bakersoll. KRAMER  (whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid   from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.  GEORGE  Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?  KRAMER  Tuesday? Uh... GEORGE  Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car   with the bench seats that you like. ESTELLE  Oh, I don't care. KRAMER  Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to   the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates. GEORGE  Well, giddy-up!  (At the motor vehicle bureau...) KRAMER  Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo   Kramer. CLERK  Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...  KRAMER  All righty... CLERK  Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)  KRAMER  (signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks.   (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm   not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake. CLERK  What's your name again? KRAMER  Cosmo Kramer. CLERK  (checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.  KRAMER  No! I'm not the Assman. CLERK  Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.   (Failing to clear up the mistake, Kramer drives off with the new plates   attached)  (Meanwhile, we join Elaine and David---in bed, I should add. David, who   apparently looks satisfied, is still breathless. Elaine, on the other hand,   is looking somewhat, preoccupied) DAVID  How do you feel? ELAINE  Fine. DAVID  Something the matter? ELAINE  No. DAVID  Then what is it? ELAINE  No, nothing.  (Later on, at Monk's, Jerry has just come in to meet Elaine. He joins her at   the booth) JERRY  Hi. ELAINE  I was with David *Putty* last night.  JERRY  Yeah, so. ELAINE  He did the move. JERRY  What move? ELAINE  You know...*the* move. JERRY  Wait a second. *My* move?  (Elaine nods). JERRY  David Putty used *my* move? ELAINE  Yes, yes. JERRY  Are you sure? ELAINE  Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.  JERRY  I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.  ELAINE  What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it   again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat! JERRY  Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we   were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex   talk. It's a high-testosterone area. ELAINE  Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?  JERRY  Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.  ELAINE  Well, wait---wait a second. JERRY  What? ELAINE  Isn't that a little...rash? JERRY  No! He stole my move! ELAINE  Yeah, but...*I* like the move. JERRY  Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.  ELAINE  Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a   pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*! JERRY  Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new.   Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His   whole *repertoire* could be lifted. ELAINE  You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.  JERRY  I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.   (Later, Jerry and George are outside, where Jerry has just bought a candy bar   at the newsstand) JERRY  ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.  GEORGE  You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a   move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a   bite. JERRY  Can I just get it opened first? GEORGE  I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing   two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo. JERRY  All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy   bar). GEORGE  (takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.  JERRY  You feel better? GEORGE  Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need   *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during   love-making. JERRY  Nancy Klopper? GEORGE  Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here.   Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All   right, come on, let's have it. JERRY  All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure,   before--- GEORGE  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.  JERRY  It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like   this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a   *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---  GEORGE  You're gonna tell me...or not. JERRY  All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a   headboard. GEORGE  I got a headboard. JERRY  Is it padded? GEORGE  No. JERRY  Good. How tall is she? GEORGE  Five-foot four. Why? JERRY  You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights.   Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck. GEORGE  I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.  JERRY  George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.  Jerry and George have just walked in, still   conversing on the same subject) JERRY  Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the   swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great   capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.  GEORGE  Is it a clockwise swirl? JERRY  I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.   (Kramer enters, holding an object of some kind). KRAMER  Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).  JERRY  What is it? KRAMER  *Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?  JERRY  When did you do this? KRAMER  In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one   of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta   that captures the individual. JERRY  Oh... Why Fusilli? KRAMER  Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry)   Yeah... JERRY  Well, thank you very much. GEORGE  So, did you get your new plates? KRAMER  Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody   got mine and I got their *vanity* plates. GEORGE  What do they say? KRAMER  Assman. JERRY  Assman? KRAMER  Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!  JERRY  Who would order a license plate that says \"Assman\"?  GEORGE  Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's. JERRY  It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be   just some guy with a big ass. KRAMER  Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.  JERRY  Yeah. Proctologist. GEORGE  Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.  KRAMER  Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very   good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away.   *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've   ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something   up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in  THE SAME WAY  \"It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.\"   (A phone rings in the distant) KRAMER  Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves) GEORGE  So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)  JERRY  I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.   (We cut to the garage where David Putty is working on a car. Jerry walks in)  JERRY  Hey, David. DAVID  Oh, hi, Jerry. JERRY  Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.  DAVID  What move? JERRY  What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on   Elaine. DAVID  You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew   you. All you told me about was the ending. JERRY  The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing.   You had *nothing*. DAVID  Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out   anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist. JERRY  Swirl. DAVID  Whatever. I don't even do it. JERRY  Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.  DAVID  Yeah, that's right. JERRY  You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples?   You're nothing but a hack. DAVID  Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.  JERRY  Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out   of town...okay. But not in the city. DAVID  All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take   *that* out of town. JERRY  Fine. DAVID  Good!  (While driving, Jerry hits a pothole and his car is now making a clanking   noise)  (We join George and Nancy, who are....getting busy under the covers.)  NANCY  Ow, George! (crawls out from beneath the covers) What are you   doing? GEORGE  (pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you   know, uh...pleasuring you. NANCY  Well, stop it! GEORGE  You don't like the move? NANCY  No. I don't. GEORGE  You're kidding. NANCY  No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body.  GEORGE  Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.   (Back to Elaine and David in the middle of, uh...you know...)  ELAINE  Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!  DAVID  No, I'm sorry. ELAINE  What?!! DAVID  I can't do the move. ELAINE  What? DAVID  Oh, he's ruined it for me. ELAINE  Oh, oh, come on, please? DAVID  No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.  ELAINE  Oh, so---so that's it? DAVID  I'll come up with some new stuff.  (Cut to Kramer heading towards his car. He picks up a note on his windshield   and reads it...) KRAMER  \"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what   you're looking for.\" (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).   (Meanwhile, Estelle is at Dr. Bakersoll's office) DR. BAKERSOLL  I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at   least ten day. You can ruin the operation. ESTELLE  Oh, okay. DR. BAKERSOLL  Now, is someone coming to pick you up?  ESTELLE  Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.   (In the parking lot just outside, Kramer has pulls into a \"Doctors Only\"   space) SECURITY GUARD  Can I help you? KRAMER  Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.  SECURITY GUARD  Oh, oh, okay. Sure... KRAMER  Thanks. Have a good day.  (Kramer is driving Estelle home) KRAMER  I just can't get over how fantastic you look.  ESTELLE  Oh, really? KRAMER  Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.  ESTELLE  And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.   (As a car passes Kramer, someone yells out, \"Yo, Assman! Look at the   Assman!\" Kramer waves). ESTELLE  Did he say \"Assman\"? KRAMER  Oh, yeah. ESTELLE  Oh my goodness. \"Hey, the Assman's in town!\") KRAMER  You got that straight! ESTELLE  Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.   (Kramer makes a sudden stop, and in a protective gesture, he sticks his arm   out in front of Estelle.)  (Back to Jerry's apartment) JERRY  You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the   order. Did you close with the swirl? GEORGE  Supposed to close with the swirl? JERRY  Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression   there. I told you to write it down. GEORGE  Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.   (Bzzz. Jerry walks over to answer it) JERRY  Yeah? BUZZER  Elaine. JERRY  C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't   even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.  (The phone rings) JERRY  Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred   dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything.   I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye. GEORGE  What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it   is. He's not gonna cheat you. JERRY  Except that it's not Putty. GEORGE  What happened to Putty? JERRY  Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other   place. I think they might be trying to screw me. GEORGE  Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think?   That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. \"By the   way, you need a new Johnson rod in there.\" \"Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well,   you better put one of those on.\"  (Elaine comes in looking a bit peeved) JERRY  Hey, Elaine. ELAINE  Yeah, yeah, hello. JERRY  Is it something I said? ELAINE  Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.  JERRY  Really? ELAINE  Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.  JERRY  What is it? ELAINE  Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's   like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.  JERRY  Huh. ELAINE  I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of   my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me,   when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!  GEORGE  Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle   involved in any way? ELAINE  Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.  GEORGE  I think that's mine. ELAINE  I'm not surprised. JERRY  Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're   gonna see him? ELAINE  Why? JERRY  You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is   trying to screw me. ELAINE  An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?  JERRY  Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just   kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work   order) ELAINE  (takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the   table) What? What is this? JERRY  That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry. ELAINE  Fusilli Jerry? JERRY  Yeah. Kramer made it. GEORGE  All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.   (As George is leaving, Kramer comes in with a female companion)  JERRY  Hey, Assman! KRAMER  Hey, well, this is Sally. SALLY  Hello. JERRY  Hi. ELAINE  Hi. KRAMER  Shall we go? SALLY  Okay. (turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing of her   hips)  (Elaine, Jerry, and George make a face)  (Back at the Costanzas' house...) ESTELLE  You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.  FRANK  You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a   dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*. ESTELLE  Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.  FRANK  I got things to do, too. ESTELLE  Don't upset me! I can't cry! FRANK  Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?  ESTELLE  Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.  FRANK  Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.  ESTELLE  I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.  FRANK  He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!   (Once again, we join Elaine and David...in bed as usual...doing what they do   best) ELAINE  Hey, let me ask you a question. DAVID  Sure. ELAINE  What do you charge for blown shocks?  DAVID  What? ELAINE  Two, three hundred? DAVID  I don't know. Maybe five hundred. ELAINE  Ah.  (They go back to kissing) ELAINE  What about a bad gasket? DAVID  Bad gasket? ELAINE  Yeah. Like a terrible gasket. DAVID  What is all this? ELAINE  Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.  DAVID  What kind of car is it? ELAINE  Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.  DAVID  All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.  ELAINE  Oh.  (Kiss again) ELAINE  Is that with the parts and labor? DAVID  Uh-huh. ELAINE  Hmm.  (Kiss...again) ELAINE  Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....   (Back to George and Nancy in bed. George is looking quite pleased with   himself. Nancy, on the other hand, looks...bewildered...pleasantly   surprised...) NANCY  Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.  GEORGE  It just came to me. NANCY  I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?  GEORGE  You mean in the end? NANCY  Uh-huh. GEORGE  A counter-clockwise swirl.  (Spotting something on George's hand) NANCY  What's that? GEORGE  What? NANCY  On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.  GEORGE  Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.  NANCY  Give me that. (grabs his hand) I wanna see what's on your hand.   (They struggle for a bit, but Nancy finally gets a hold of his hand and tries   to make out the scribble) NANCY  Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got   crib notes?!! GEORGE  It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.  NANCY  Oh, my god, you're sick. (gets out of bed)  GEORGE  You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!  (Cut to Frank on the streets. He spots Kramer's car. He looks inside the   back window and sees the \"Bro\"---or is it the \"Manssierre\"? He checks out   the plates) FRANK  Assman? I'll get him, Assman!  (Back to Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me   off. ELAINE  So what are you going to do? JERRY  Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.  ELAINE  Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?  JERRY  Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know   what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.   (There's a knock at the door and Jerry goes over to answer it)  JERRY  Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...? FRANK  Where's your friend Kramer? JERRY  I don't know. Why? FRANK  Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.  JERRY  What do you mean? FRANK  In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know   what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years   ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I   stopped short. JERRY  Really, stopping short. That's a good move.  FRANK  You're not kidding it's a good move!   (Kramer walks in.) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Hey, Frank. FRANK  Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with   my wife! KRAMER  C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.   (Frank backs Kramer into the table, knocking the Fusilli Jerry to the floor)  FRANK  You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the   profits on the Manssierre with you. KRAMER  Bro. FRANK  Manssierre! KRAMER  Bro! FRANK  Manssierre! You...!  (Frank grabs Kramer by the collar and in doing so, he slips and falls right   on top of the Fusilli Jerry) FRANK  Aah!!! JERRY  Oh, my god!  (Everyone gasps in horror, including George, who was just walking in at that   very moment)  (At the medical center, the gang is in the waiting room, waiting for the word   on  Frank's condition. Looks like they're still in shock) JERRY  If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.  ELAINE  Me either. GEORGE  They say this guy's the best. JERRY  He had to use cork-screw pasta.  (At that thought, Jerry, George, and Elaine shift uncomfortably in their   seats. Meanwhile, Kramer is checking out the pictures on the wall. He spots   something...) KRAMER  Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.   (Jerry joins him) KRAMER  The name on the boat. Look at it. JERRY  Assman! KRAMER  Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry,   *he's* the Assman!  (The doctor walks in) DOCTOR  Which one is the son? GEORGE  (stands up) I am. DOCTOR  Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't   take long. And he's going to be fine.  (Kramer stops Dr. Cooperman at the door.) KRAMER  Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the   wrong license plates? DR. COOPERMAN  Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to   straighten it out. KRAMER  So...you're the Assman.  (Dr. Cooperman winks and heads back to where Frank is waiting)  FRANK  It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.   (Back at the Costanza's house, George and Frank are just walking in)  ESTELLE  Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've   been waiting for hours! FRANK  I fell on some Fusilli. ESTELLE  Fusilli? FRANK  You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck   in me. Had to go to the proctologist. ESTELLE  The proctologist? Are you okay? FRANK  Yeah. ESTELLE  Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)  GEORGE  Ma, don't cry! ESTELLE  Oh, I can't help it! GEORGE  Ma, your eyes! ESTELLE  Oh! THE END>",

Hundred fifty dollars a year to sit in a room, eat peanuts, drink coffee and soda, and read magazines. Excuse me, but isn't this the flight? I already got four hours of this comin' to me... What am I paying for? How bout' an 'I got all my luggage club'? Can I get into that club? Where is that club? I would like to join that club. Airlines love to divide us into classes. You know like when you're sitting in coach, the stewardess always closes that stupid curtain. Always gives you that look, like, maybe if you would work a little harder...  JERRY  What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)  ELAINE  Is that the supermodel? JERRY  Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.  ELAINE  I thought you had a show in Ithaca.  JERRY  I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.  ELAINE  Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.  JERRY  So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.  ELAINE  I've had enough. I am marchin' in.  JERRY  You're marchin' in. ELAINE  I'm marchin'. (Enter George) GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  Hey. Elaine's quitting. GEORGE  Really? ELAINE  I'm marchin' in. GEORGE  I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.  JERRY  How 'bout the march out? GEORGE  Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.  ELAINE  This is it. Wish me luck. JERRY  Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)  GEORGE  Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.  JERRY  What for? GEORGE  They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.  JERRY  Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?  GEORGE  It better be. ELAINE  Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.  PITT  One second Elaine. ELAINE  Mr. Pitt... PITT  Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.  ELAINE  What? PITT  Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.  ELAINE  (Flattered) Mr. Pitt... PITT  (Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?  ELAINE  Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,  PITT  Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.  ELAINE  We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.  GEORGE  (Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?  MORGAN  Why? GEORGE  Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.  MORGAN  I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?  GEORGE  No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...   ...  .....................????recessed on the floor. ELAINE  Oh my God. WOMAN  Who are you? PITT  This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...  MAN  Please, rest Mr. Pitt. WOMAN  You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?  ELAINE  Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?  MAN  Took a very dangerous combination: prescription heart medicine and these other pills.  ELAINE  Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.  PITT  I spoke to someone who worked there.  ELAINE  I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)  WOMAN  How well do you know her? KATIE  Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-  JERRY  Yes, I know. I've flown before. KATIE  Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?  JERRY  No. KATIE  (Pause) Because even if you have (Jerry gets up to go) to go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance until way after take off.  KRAMER  Hey, how you doin'? EARL  Pretty good. KRAMER  Name's Kramer. EARL  Earl Hafler, nice to meet you. I'm headed to Houston, where you headed?  KRAMER  Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.  EARL  Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight to Houston.  KRAMER  Bet? Um, not betting. EARL  Friendly wager. KRAMER  I haven't made a bet in three years, I-  EARL  Ah c'mon. Keep things interesting, pass the time.  KRAMER  Okay, how much? EARL  How 'bout 200? KRAMER  You're on, cowboy! GEORGE  How ya doin'? MAN  Okay. GEORGE  Nice day today. MAN  What? GEORGE  I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?  INTERCOM  Now arriving at gate 12... EARL  This could be Mexico City. KRAMER  C'mon Seattle, let's go. EARL  Come on, Mexico City! KRAMER  Seattle, yeah! INTERCOM  ...flight 42 from Mexico City. KRAMER  All right, c'mon, let's go again. ELAINE  Mr. Pitt, do you need anything? PITT  No. ELAINE  You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?  PITT  Okay. KATIE  It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, he's got a birthday next week.  JERRY  I don't care. KATIE  By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the pilot is going to be in the audience.  JERRY  Who? KATIE  Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting out there watching the show.  JERRY  I don't care, why are you telling me this?  KATIE  I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.  JERRY  Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...  OFF STAGE  Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld! (Clapping)  JERRY  Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..  KATIE  It didn't go very well, did it? JERRY  No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.  KATIE  I knew it. JERRY  If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.  KATIE  Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out.  JERRY  Oh, it doesn't matter now. KATIE  Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this.  JERRY  Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!  EARL  Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200... Will that be cash or check?  KRAMER  All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.  EARL  All right, but I wanna see some cash on the table.  KRAMER  All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)  N  Hello? KRAMER  Yeah, it's, uh, me. N  Hey, what's up? KRAMER  All right, listen. I need some cash.  N  What for? KRAMER  I just need it, that's all. N  Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh you weak, weak man. Where are you?  KRAMER  I'm at the airport. N  The airport? KRAMER  We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.  N  I don't have that kinda dough. KRAMER  Sure you do. N  Oh no, no, not the bag! KRAMER  Oh help me man, I'm desperate! N  All right, all right. INTERCOM  Sorry for the delay, folks, there is a slight complication that we're taking care of, and then we'll be on our way to La Guardia...  JERRY  (To Katie) What is the complication?  FLISHT ATTENDANT  Mr. Seinfeld? JERRY  Yes? FA  I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane.  JERRY  What? FA  Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you.  KATIE  I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.  JERRY  I didn't care. FA  Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane.  JERRY  He can't just throw me off the plane!  FA  Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance.  JERRY  But I'm not a disturbance! FA  Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir.  JERRY  But someone is waiting for me! KATIE  Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.  JERRY  I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!  KATIE  There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, which one do you want?  JERRY  Which one do you think I want? KATIE  The eight will get you in a little earlier.  JERRY  Then we'll make it the eight. KATIE  I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?)  JERRY  Hotel? KATIE  Yeah, it's eight in the morning. JERRY  No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.  KATIE  Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?  JERRY  I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?  KATIE  Okay, you're a big celebrity. (She exits)  GEORGE  Yo. JERRY  George. GEORGE  Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca? JERRY  I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...  GEORGE  Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?  JERRY  Carl, I think. GEORGE  Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy. JERRY  Yeah, he was nice. GEORGE  What company was it? JERRY  Defent. GEORGE  Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...  JERRY  You need an exterminator? GEORGE  No, not really. JERRY  Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?  GEORGE  Gotta go. JERRY  George, George! JERRY  Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?  WOMAN  Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.  ELAINE  Hello? JERRY  Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.  ELAINE  That's at the airport, right? JERRY  Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.  ELAINE  All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.  JERRY  I am a little freaked out! ELAINE  Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)  JERRY  All right, but you have to go now.  ELAINE  I said I'll take care of it! N  Kramer. KRAMER  Hey. N  Okay, here it is. KRAMER  Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral.  EARL  So it's a mailbag, so what? N  So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?  EARL  (Reading) David Berkowitz. N  Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.  EARL  Where did you get this? N  I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on that route.  EARL  Any of 'em talk to you? N  Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!  EARL  (To Kramer) Your buddy's a helluva guy.  KRAMER  Yeah, don't I know it. EARL  Okay, Cosmo, we're back in business. Let's check out the board. Now, who do you like?  KRAMER  All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?  EARL  All right, I'll give you a sportin' chance. I'll take Ithaca.  KRAMER  Double or nothin'. EARL  Double or nothin'. N  I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a look of lack of confidence)  JERRY  (Wakes up) Where are we? KATIE  I'm not sure. JERRY  Is this even a road? KATIE  Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.  JERRY  What? Why didn't you wake me up? KATIE  You told me not to bother you with minor details.  JERRY  No, road is a major detail! KATIE  Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do you have a preference?  JERRY  (Pointing ahead) Look out! GEORGE  May I help you? CARL  I'm the exterminator. GEORGE  Oh, yes of course, come in. CARL  Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?  GEORGE  Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?  CARL  Do I know you? GEORGE  Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.  CARL  Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?  GEORGE  Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?  PHONE  Mr. Morgan left for dinner. GEORGE  He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?  TV  Here's a new twist on car pooling: Early this morning, a lost Manhattanite drove through a residential backyard and wound up in a swimming pool near Ithaca, New York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a passenger, seemed a little freaked out.  JERRY  That's it! No more questions! I don't care!  PITT  That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! He's no pharmacist.  WOMAN  Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier for Elaine. (She looks at Mr. Pitt)  GEORGE  (To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor: pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.  CARL  I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused)  GEORGE  That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.  EARL  Well, that Newman was your good luck charm.  KRAMER  Yeah, he was. EARL  I should have quitted at double or nothin'. Travelers checks acceptable?  KRAMER  Oh I accept. N  (Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right next to me. We once double dated.  KRAMER  Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)  ELAINE  Kramer. KRAMER  Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?  ELAINE  Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?  EARL  What about the plane in Ithaca? ELAINE  Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?  KRAMER  Boy... EARL  Your friend caused the delay? ELAINE  Uh huh. EARL  You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Hafler.  KRAMER  C'mon! EARL  See you around, Cosmo. KRAMER  What? ELAINE  Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!  PITT  You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye. ELAINE  Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)  JERRY  Bridget! BRIDGET  Jerry, what happened? JERRY  Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.  BRIDGET  Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour.  JERRY  Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!  GEORGE  I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.  MORGAN  Is that right? CARL  Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the rat problems in the kitchen.  MORGAN  (George spits out food) I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low. (He leaves)  GEORGE  Check, please. WAITER  Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house.  GEORGE  Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan! THE END>",

It's not like somebody died. It's \"Beaches\" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.   (Next day, Jerry and George enter Jerry's apartment) JERRY  She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was \"Beaches\" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?  GEORGE  Where were you? JERRY  I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.  GEORGE  Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.  JERRY  Of course. GEORGE  When you're talking about a movie like \"Beaches\", moving from the chair to the couch ... that's quite a voyage.  JERRY  yeah,  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey. GEORGE  Hey. I gotta go. KRAMER  Where you going? JERRY  The Improv is playing \"Rochelle Rochelle\" The musical.  KRAMER  Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?  JERRY  She might be. She's the star of the show.  KRAMER  Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.  GEORGE  I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.  KRAMER  So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.  GEORGE  Gennice palying today? JERRY  Yeah, maybe. KRAMER  Who's Gennice? JERRY  That's the understudy. I'm dating her.  KRAMER  Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?  JERRY  Yeah. KRAMER  Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.  JERRY  I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.  GEORGE  Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.  JERRY  Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thing...real bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.   (Ruby's Nail Parlor  - Korean language in quotes) RUBY  You late. ELAINE  I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus  RUBY  \"That's a shame\". You'll have to wait for Lotus now.  ELAINE  How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.  RUBY  \"Mustn't keep the princess waiting. Princess in a big hurry.\" \"No change for bus\" \"Poor princess.\"  ELAINE  What?, uh? RUBY  Nothing, won't be long. LOTUS  \"Princess wants a manicure.\" SUNNY  \"Oh lucky me.\" LOTUS  \"Oh, you got the princess.\" ELAINE  What is so funny? RUBY  ...tell knock-knock joke.  (Baseball diamond in the park) ELAINE  The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.  JERRY  How would you know? You don't speak Korean.  ELAINE  Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at me...ge ge ge  KRAMER  You know, maybe in Korean \"dog\" isn't an insult. Could be like the word \"fox\" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!  JERRY  Why don't you go to another nail shop?  ELAINE  Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  JERRY  What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.  ELAINE  Yeah, who speaks Korean? JERRY  You know who speaks Korean? ELAINE  No, who? JERRY  George's father. ELAINE  You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?  JERRY  He used to go there a lot on business.  ELAINE  What did he do? JERRY  He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.  ELAINE  Uh, JERRY  George, does your father speak Korean?  GEORGE  Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.  JERRY  Oh, hi Gennice. GENNICE  Hi Jerry. JERRY  This is George, this is Kramer. GENNICE  Nice to meet you. JERRY  Playing today? GENNICE  No. I'm on the bench today. JERRY  They really stick to that understudy rule.  KRAMER  So she's coming? GENNICE  Oh, yeah, she'll be here. . . .(DROPS HOT DOG) Oh no, my frankfurter, my frankfurter fell (sob sob sob sob) . It was really good. I can't believe that I dropped it. (sob sob sob sob)  JERRY  It's okay...it's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.  GENNICE  No it (sob) was really good.  (Crowd yelling - Bette arrives) KRAMER  Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.  BETTE  Hi. KRAMER  Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.  BETTE  Uh, thank you. KRAMER  Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.  BETTE  Really? KRAMER  Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.  BETTE  What flavours do they have? KRAMER  Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry. BETTE  How about Pineapple? KRAMER  Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back.   (First Italian ice cream seller) ICE CREAM VENDOR #1  No pineapple. Just Cherry, Lemon and Tutti-Frutti  KRAMER  Oh, uh, uh. (Leaves)  (Monk's) ELAINE  Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?  FRANK  I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy.  ELAINE  uh, ha. FRANK  Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.  ELAINE  Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.  FRANK  No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odour problem.   (Baseball diamond- Bette at bat) GEORGE  I watched \"Beaches\" on cable last night. ...(wings?) ... Give me a break.  BETTE  Get some talent then you can mouth off.  UMPIRE  Strike three. BETTE  What? Are you blind? UMPIRE  What? BETTE  Nothing, nothing.  (Monk's) FRANK  I had an affair with a Korean woman.  ELAINE  Uh, Mr. Costanza, I ... FRANK  No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.  ELAINE  Mr. Costanza, I, ... FRANK  Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, \" eno enoa juang \". Which means, \"this guy - this is not my kind of guy\".   (On Stree) ICE CREAM VENDOR #2  Sure I got Pineapple.  (Kramer runs back with it)  (Baseball diamond - George at bat) BETTE  Move it in. Move in everybody. Get your shrimp here. Shrimp on special today!  JERRY  Come on George, just loosen up.  (George hits one ) JERRY  Come on George. KRAMER  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE. : I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  JERRY  (to George) Keep going. GEORGE  Aaaaaah  (George runs into Bette (trivia- but misses home plate)) UMPIRE  SAFE!  (Mob gets angry and chases George and Jerry) GEORGE  come on it's just a game. KRAMER  (holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) \"You are the wind...\"   (Jerry's Apartment) TV  the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical.   (Genice enters) GENNICE  . . . Thank you. (hugs Jerry and George)  JERRY  Well we... GENNICE  No, please. This is the first time in my life (sobs) that anyone has ever done anything like this for me. I've always had to struggle so hard for everything I ever got. (sobbing) and I know this is going to be my big break. (sobbing)  JERRY  (with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.   (Knocking at door) KRAMER  Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!  JERRY  Come back another time.  (Shot of each lock being opened) KRAMER  SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.   (Turning to Genice) KRAMER  So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)   (Nail Parlour) ELAINE  Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.  RUBY  What would you like today? Manicure, Pedicure?  FRANK  I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.  RUBY  \"That's the least of his problems.\"  FRANK  What was that? ELAINE  What'd they say? What'd they say? FRANK  They made a derogatory comment about me.  RUBY  \"She's with a man twice her age.\" \"He doesn't look like he's got much money either.\"  LOTUS  \"Check out that sweater\". (all laughing)  RUBY  \"I think I saw a moth fly out of a pocket.\"  LOTUS  \"What happened to his tail?\" FRANK  Okay, THAT'S IT! \"oki on awa\" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.   (Back room) KIM  That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight.  LOTUS  That man also refuses to take his shoes off.  FRANK  (from other room) I never seen people treated like this!  RUBY  You brought in a spy! . . . Get Out!  KIM  Frank? FRANK  Kim?  (Hospital room) KRAMER  (on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw, ... you want whit e meat or dark?  BETTE  White meat. KRAMER  Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.  BETTE  Get me one of those Black and White cookies.  KRAMER  yeah, all right, yeah.... (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.  BETTE  Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not going to be very pleasant to be around.  KRAMER  Now that's impossible.  (On rainy street at night) ELAINE  (sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella) ... I don't even know where I'm going.  PETERMAN  That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.  ELAINE  yes, (sob) I suppose, ... PETERMAN  Have you been crying? ELAINE  Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,...  PETERMAN  Oh no, that doesn't matter now. That's a very nice jacket.  ELAINE  Uh, (sob) thanks. PETERMAN  Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola.  ELAINE  How do you know all that? PETERMAN  That's my coat. ELAINE  You mean..? PETERMAN  Yes, I'm J. Peterman. ELAINE  Oh!  (In Taxi) JERRY  I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.   (Crowd yelling) GENNICE  Hey, I didn't do anything. I was never informed. ... YOU CAN ALL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL.... You see that? You see what I am going through?  GEORGE  So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.  JERRY  Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.  GENNICE  I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy. (sob) Nobody in the show will even talk to me.  JERRY  Stop your crying will ya? GENNICE  What? GEORGE  You heard him. GENNICE  Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened.  GEORGE  Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?  CABBIE  Wait. Wait. I know you. You knocked Bette Midler out of Rochelle Rochelle the Musical. I want you creeps out of my cab.  JERRY  Hey, I had nothing to do with it. CABBIE  Get out of my cab. You should go to prison. You should be in prison for the rest of your life. Get out, each of you. Each and every one of you get out of my cab.   (Restaurant) PETERMAN  Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.   Ex; Oh, that's not too expensive. PETERMAN  That shirt. Where did you get it? ELAINE  Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.  PETERMAN  That's NOT bad!  (Frank's car) KIM  Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off.  FRANK  I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.  KIM  I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.  FRANK  I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.  KIM  Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us.  FRANK  Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.   (Screeching of brakes) KIM  You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever want to see you again.   (Bette's hospital room - Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)  BETTE  ... What is it? KRAMER  It's macaroni Midler. BETTE  Macaroni Midler? KRAMER  Yeah, see how you're singing? BETTE  ... yeah ...ha ha. Well you made a long journey from Milan to Minsk.  KRAMER  oh, what's that from? BETTE  Oh, that's one of the songs from my show. Bette sings:   \"Well you made a long journey from Milan to Minsk.  Rochelle Rochelle.  You never stopped hoping. now you're in the Pinsk  Rochelle Rochelle  When the nay sayers nay you pick up your pace  So nothing's going to stop me so get out of my face.  I'm having adventures all over the place.  Rochelle ROCHELLE!\" KRAMER  Oh You are so freaking talented.  (knock at door - Kramer goes out into hall) KRAMER  Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.  JERRY  We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.  KRAMER  No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.  JERRY  What? KRAMER  Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.  GEORGE  Who are you to decide? KRAMER  I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!  GEORGE  Hey, look, Kramer,... KRAMER  AH! I don't want her disturbed.  (Outside Broadway Theater) RUBY  hello, Elaine. ELAINE  Hello LOTUS  We're so excited. ELAINE  You're welcome. RUBY  We'll see you inside. JERRY  What happened? ELAINE  Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.  JERRY  Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.  ELAINE  Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.  JERRY  Where? ELAINE  Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.  JERRY  (pushing her) How did you get that?  ELAINE  I met him. JERRY  You met J. Peterman? ELAINE  yeah. JERRY  What is he like? JERRY  (walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'.  ELAINE  . . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...   (Backstage) JERRY  Well, break a leg tonight. GENNICE  I'm really nervous. STAGEHAND  Here you got a telegram. Well, look who's here.  JERRY  Listen buddy, STAGEHAND  What are you going to do? Break my legs? You don't scare me. You or your goons.  GENNICE  How do you like this? JERRY  What is it? GENNICE  My grandmother died. JERRY  Oh, I'm so sorry. GENNICE  Oh, it's okay, JERRY  So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?  VOICE  (Off camera) Places everyone. GENNICE  I gotta go. JERRY  Good luck.  (Audience) ANNOUNCER  ladies and gentlemen for this evening's performance the part of Rochelle will be played by Gennice Grant.  LOTUS  Gennice Glant? RUBY  What happened to Bette Midler? ELAINE  Oh, she got hurt. RUBY  No Bette Midler? (they talk Korean and all three leave)  ELAINE  I, uh, wait..  (On Stage) GENNICE  (singing and dancing) \"It's a long journey from Milan to Minsk\" (Shoe lace comes undone) wait wait. Hold it stop, (sob) I'm sorry, I have to start it over, my shoelace.

        "text": "  THE FACE PAINTER Written by   Larry David   (Comedy club) JERRY  Monkeys are really the end of the line in the pet world. I think when you're at the monkey level of pet ownership, have a kid. I mean, come on, you know, I mean, you're *so* close. If you need a pet that can roller skate and smoke cigars, it's time to think about a family. Monkeys, of course, were the first astronauts in the sixties, which I'm sure made perfect sense in the monkey brain. 'Maybe that is the next logical step for me, because I've been working with the Italian guy and the crank organ, and I think I'm ready to handle the maximum re-entry g-forces.   (George and his date are talking in his car.) GEORGE  Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?  SIENA  That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper.  GEORGE  And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.  SIENA  Yeah, you're right George. What else can they do?  GEORGE  It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.  SIENA  Wow. GEORGE  You find this interesting, don't you?  SIENA  Yes. yes, I do.  (They stare at each other for a moment, then embrace.)  Jerry and Elaine are at the coffee shop. ELAINE  Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.  JERRY  What are you telling him for? ELAINE  What? JERRY  He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?  ELAINE  Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?  JERRY  Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, \"Hey, they like the soup!Keep it up!\"?  ELAINE  Hey, isn't that Alec Berg? JERRY  Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.  ELAINE  I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.  JERRY  John Houseman? ELAINE  No, Alec Berg. ALEC  Elaine! ELAINE  Hi! ALEC  Hi, how are you? Jerry. JERRY  Hi, Alec. ALEC  Did you hear about Gary Fogel? JERRY  Yeah. ALEC  You gonna go to the funeral on Friday?  JERRY  Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats   right behind the glass? ALEC  Those are them, yeah. Season tickets. Uh, you know, unfortunately I can't go tonight, so they're available if you'd like to use them.  JERRY  Oh, I'd love to, are you sure? ALEC  Absolutely, you just call my secretary, she'll arrange everything.  JERRY  Gee thanks! Thanks a lot! ALEC  It's my pleasure. Be good. (Walking away, he stops abruptly) You know,   I actually might not use them on Friday either so I'll let you know.  JERRY  Alright, thanks again. ELAINE  Thank you very much. JERRY  Really, thank you.  Jerry and Elaine are back at his apartment. JERRY  Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are? ELAINE  Who? JERRY  These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you? ELAINE  I will never understand people. JERRY  They're the worst.  George enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers and singing. GEORGE  Something's up, there's something in the air.  JERRY  Well, what is with you? GEORGE  Well, I think this is it. ELAINE  What's it? GEORGE  I saw Siena again. ELAINE  Siena? JERRY  Yeah, he's dating a crayon. GEORGE  We discussed toilet paper. JERRY  Toilet paper? GEORGE  Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated! JERRY  What are you talking about? ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Toilet paper's changed. ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  It's softer. ELAINE  Softer. JERRY  More sheets per roll ELAINE  Sheets. JERRY  Comes in a wide variety of colors.  ELAINE  Colors. GEORGE  Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move. JERRY  What? GEORGE  I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I   just chickened out. JERRY  Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return? GEORGE  Fifty-fifty. JERRY  Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there. GEORGE  Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it? ELAINE  What, you never said it? GEORGE  Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.  JERRY  Well, so it wasn't a total loss.  Kramer enters. KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight! KRAMER  Oh, I'm there, Monongahela! JERRY  What about you, George? GEORGE  Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.  KRAMER  So, so. GEORGE  Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game. KRAMER  She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.  JERRY  Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?  ELAINE  Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.  JERRY  Sure, fine with me. GEORGE  Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer. KRAMER  So she works at the zoo? GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. KRAMER  Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.  Elaine is at Puddy's apartment, waiting in the living room while he gets ready.  ELAINE  So how long have you been a Devils' fan?  PUDDY  Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.  ELAINE  Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.  PUDDY  Hey, no way, man. ELAINE  Yes. PUDDY  We're primed. ELAINE  Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.  Puddy enters wearing a Devils' jersey and red and green paint all over his face.  ELAINE  What the-- PUDDY  So what do you think? ELAINE  What is that? PUDDY  I painted my face. ELAINE  You painted your face? PUDDY  Yeah. ELAINE  Why? PUDDY  You know, support the team. ELAINE  Well, you can't walk around like that.  PUDDY  Why not? ELAINE  Because it's insane? PUDDY  Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.   There's a knock at the door, Puddy answers it. It's Jerry and Kramer. Kramer enters first and does a typical 'Kramer take' when he sees Puddy's painted face. He recovers quickly. KRAMER  Hey. PUDDY  Hey. ELAINE  Dave, um, painted his face. KRAMER  Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.  PUDDY  Ok, ready to go? KRAMER  Yeah. PUDDY  LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!  Madison Square Garden, the four of them are at the game. Three are seated, Puddy has his face pressed against the glass as there's action in his corner.  PUDDY  You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!  FAN #1  Will you sit down? PUDDY  Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.  ELAINE  Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!  PUDDY  Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their   heads.  Just then the Devils score a goal and Puddy is back up, banging the glass.  PUDDY  Go Devils!!  George and Siena are sitting in the car again. They're listening to the hockey game on the radio. RADIO ANNOUNCER  Devils goal! Stephan Richer scores from just inside the blue line! And the Devils take-- (George turns down the volume) GEORGE  You know, I could have actually gone to that.  SIENA  So why didn't you? GEORGE  Well, I didn't want to break our date.  SIENA  Oh, well. GEORGE  Because I... I love you. SIENA  You know, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.   Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and Puddy are walking on the street after the game. The Devils must have won because Puddy is gloating. PUDDY  Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate! KRAMER  Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!  The car stops just short of hitting Puddy. There's an old priest in the passenger seat. PUDDY  Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!  Puddy runs away, leaving the old priest shaken. FATHER HERNANDEZ  El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!!  Jerry and George are at the coffee shop. JERRY  \"I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.\"  GEORGE  Yup. JERRY  Big matzoh ball. GEORGE  Huge matzoh ball. JERRY  Those damn 'I love you' returns. GEORGE  Well, it's all over. I slipped up.  JERRY  Oh, you don't know. GEORGE  You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, \"I love you\", and the other says, \"I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.\".  JERRY  Unless you're married. GEORGE  I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them. JERRY  No, people hate that. GEORGE  You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.  JERRY  Ideally. GEORGE  I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.  WAITRESS  Matzoh ball soup? GEORGE  That'd be me.  Jerry enters his apartment carrying a bag of groceries. As soon as Jerry closes the door, we hear Kramer's door open and close. That moment, Kramer walks in.  KRAMER  Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?  JERRY  No question about it. KRAMER  Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend. JERRY  At the zoo? KRAMER  Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys,   when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it. JERRY  Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?  KRAMER  Well, he started it! JERRY  It's a monkey, Kramer! KRAMER  Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.  JERRY  Well, I still think it's wrong. KRAMER  Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.  JERRY  I'm not taking anyone's side. KRAMER  Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets? JERRY  No. KRAMER  Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?  JERRY  What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him? KRAMER  Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.  JERRY  No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking. KRAMER  Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.  JERRY  Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place. KRAMER  Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.  JERRY  Ah, you're out of your mind. KRAMER  Alright, where you going? JERRY  I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.  KRAMER  Who died? JERRY  Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee? KRAMER  So he actually had it? JERRY  No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.  Riverside Gramercy Chapel. Jerry and Elaine are at Gary Fogel's funeral.  ELAINE  That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco. JERRY  The one Puddy screamed at in the car?  ELAINE  Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement. JERRY  Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.  ELAINE  I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that? JERRY  Gotta support the team.  Several women weep off camera. Elaine inspects her outfit. ELAINE  You know I really hate my clothes.  JERRY  Hm. ELAINE  I open up my closet, there's just nothing.  JERRY  Hm. ELAINE  Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it. JERRY  Hm. ELAINE  It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.   Jerry (noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!  Alec barely acknowledges the greeting and takes a seat. JERRY  Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?   Kramer is in the office at the zoo. MR. PLESS  Ah, Mr. Kramer? KRAMER  Yes. MR. PLESS  Thanks for coming. KRAMER  So, uh, what did you want to see me about?  MR. PLESS  Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it, we're having a bit of a problem with Barry. KRAMER  Barry? MR. PLESS  The chimpanzee. KRAMER  Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem? MR. PLESS  Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does. He seems depressed. He's lost his appetite. He's even curtailed his autoerotic   activities. And we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you the other day. KRAMER  So, so what do you want me to do? MR. PLESS  Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize.  KRAMER  Yeah, well he started it. MR. PLESS  Mr. Kramer, he is an innocent primate.  KRAMER  So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I-- SIENA  Hey, that's ok. Well, I've gotta go feed the marmosets.  KRAMER  You know  George really likes you. MR. PLESS  She doesn't hear too well out of her left ear.  KRAMER  Oh.  Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment. JERRY  I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'? GEORGE  Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?  JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.  JERRY  Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.  GEORGE  Hey, they can't go, \"Hey! You look fabulous!\"   Kramer enters. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.  GEORGE  Girlfriend, yeah, right. KRAMER  Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.  GEORGE  Barry? KRAMER  The monkey. JERRY  Well? KRAMER  Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me. JERRY  Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.  KRAMER  Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?  GEORGE  What? KRAMER  Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that? GEORGE  Oh my god. JERRY  What? GEORGE  She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane! JERRY  Are you gonna say it again? GEORGE  That's the question, Jimmy.  Jerry and George are still at Jerry's apartment, some time has passed.  GEORGE  I'm gonna do it. JERRY  What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again. GEORGE  I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!   George storms out of the apartment as Kramer enters. KRAMER  What's going on? JERRY  He's gonna talk into her other ear.  KRAMER  Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg? JERRY  Yeah, I saw him. KRAMER  Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?  JERRY  Well, not exactly. KRAMER  He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.  JERRY  I don't know if he's mad. KRAMER  Alright, so what happened when you saw him?  JERRY  Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.  KRAMER  Uh huh. JERRY  See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'. KRAMER  See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!  JERRY  Look, what do you want me to do? KRAMER  I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!  JERRY  No. No, I can't! KRAMER  Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side! JERRY  Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.  KRAMER  You stubborn, stupid, silly man!  Elaine and Puddy are at Elaine's apartment. PUDDY  Hey, great dip. You made this? ELAINE  No, it's from the store. PUDDY  Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.  ELAINE  David? David, I think we aught to talk.  PUDDY  Alright, that's cool. ELAINE  David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.  PUDDY  You gotta be kidding, how come? ELAINE  Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.  PUDDY  Yeah, that's right. ELAINE  Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest,   I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.  PUDDY  Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint   it anymore. ELAINE  Yeah, but you like the face painting.  PUDDY  Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.  ELAINE  Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?  PUDDY  Yeah, that's right. ELAINE  That's so, that's so sweet. PUDDY  Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.  George and Siena are making out in his car. GEORGE  Siena, I love you. SIENA  Yeah, I know. I heard you the first time.  GEORGE  Yeah. Just confirming.  Jerry is sitting alone in his apartment waiting for Alec to call. The phone rings, Jerry answers. JERRY  Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.   Kramer is at the zoo, talking with Barry, the monkey. KRAMER  Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?   Kramer moves in for a handshake, Barry spits water all over his jacket. Kramer gets defensive and Barry starts screaming and climbing the cage bars.   Elaine's apartment, Elaine and Puddy are making out. She unbuttons his shirt and notices something peculiar. ELAINE  What is that? PUDDY  That's the letter 'D'. ELAINE  Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?  PUDDY  Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'. ELAINE  But you said no more painting. PUDDY  No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face. ELAINE  Yeah, that's right.  Jerry is still waiting for the phone call. Kramer enters. KRAMER  Well? Did he call? JERRY  No. KRAMER  Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him! JERRY  Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg? ALEC  What can I do for you, Jerry? JERRY  Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night. ALEC  I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight. JERRY  Oh, you already gave them away? ALEC  Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours. JERRY  No, we don't care, we just want to go.  ALEC  There is one little catch, though.   Exterior shot of MSG marquee announcing the Rangers vs Devils playoff game tonight. Cut to some on-ice action, then to the cheap seats where Puddy, Jerry and Kramer are seated, shirtless. PUDDY  Hey, great game, huh?  The Devils score a goal, Puddy stands up screaming and drags Jerry and Kramer to their feet. Alongside Puddy's 'D', Jerry sports an 'E' on his chest, Kramer has a 'V' on his, and three more shirtless guys bearing 'I',' L' and 'S' rise alongside them. All are cheering wildly, except for Jerry and Kramer who stand silent.  The El Salvadoran priest is in his bedroom, another priest is at his bedside.  PRIEST  Father Hernandez? FATHER HERNANDEZ  Huh? PRIEST  Una senora que te vino a ver. Ella dice que tiene informacion muy important information that could be helpful to you.\") FATHER HERNANDEZ  Bueno. PRIEST  Al fini finalmente paró el llover. (Subtitled: \"Finally it stopped raining.\") FATHER HERNANDEZ  Aha, bueno.  The priest shows Elaine into the room, she's wearing a white raincoat with a hood. As she approaches the bed, she's backlit by the sunlight coming through the window. ELAINE  Hello father. FATHER HERNANDEZ  Oh. La Madonna! Madre de Christo! Yo estoy lista!  THE END>",

What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.  LIZ  Checkmate. GEORGE  I don't think we should see each other any more.   (At Elaine's. She's trying to get some rest.)  (dogs barking)  ELAINE  Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.   (Monk's) JERRY  And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.  GEORGE  I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.  JERRY  Yeah, what else? GEORGE  All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?  JERRY  Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?  GEORGE  Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, \"Happy, Pappy?\"  JERRY  Oh, you're \"Pappy\". GEORGE  I'm \"Pappy\". JERRY  Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?  GEORGE  Oh, come on. What, are you kidding?  GEORGE  I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind their backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she \"shuushed you\" while you were watching TV.  JERRY  Hey, I got a real thing about \"shushing\"!  GEORGE  What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.  JERRY  Ahh. GEORGE  What? JERRY  What is this? What are we doing?

GEORGE  Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.  JERRY  Hmm. GEORGE  You thought she was good looking, right?  JERRY  See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?  GEORGE  I was just curious. JERRY  Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me.  GEORGE  I am really gonna make some changes.  GEORGE  Yes. Changes. JERRY  I'm serious about it. GEORGE  Think I'M not? JERRY  I'm not kidding. GEORGE  Me too.  (At Jerry's. He's on the phone) JERRY  Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!  KRAMER  What? JERRY  I had a very interesting lunch with George Costanza today.  KRAMER  Really? JERRY  We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.  KRAMER  So, then you asked yourselves, \"Isn't there something more to life?\"  JERRY  Yes. We did. KRAMER  Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.  JERRY  There isn't? KRAMER  Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, Jerry? Marriage? Family?  JERRY  Well... KRAMER  They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?  JERRY  Really? KRAMER  Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.  JERRY  I can? KRAMER  Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?  JERRY  What? KRAMER  You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?  JERRY  Boy. KRAMER  It's sad, Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..  JERRY  I'm glad we had this talk. KRAMER  Oh, you have no idea.  (Apiphany - on the pier) GEORGE  La-la-la...  (Jerry's.

KRAMER  What dog? KRAMER  Yeah. What dog? ELAINE  This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..  KRAMER  Don't... ELAINE  I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?  KRAMER  Well, there is something you can do.  ELAINE  What? Kramer:, I'll do anything. KRAMER  Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?  JERRY  You're going to rub out the dog? KRAMER  No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.  ELAINE  Uh-huh. JERRY  What, you're considering this? KRAMER  Look, just meet with him. ?????.  (Newman's - dark and dangerous) ELAINE  I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.  NEWMAN  Of course. Obviously. ELAINE  Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.  NEWMAN  What kind of dog did you say it was?  ELAINE  Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.  NEWMAN  I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.  NEWMAN  If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .  KRAMER  Newman! Stop it!! NEWMAN  Anyway. ELAINE  Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?  NEWMAN  Well, Elaine, there's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?  ELAINE  No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.  KRAMER  I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.  NEWMAN  Yeah, I suppose. KRAMER  Huh?

That's what was so vexing. GEORGE  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?  JERRY  What? GEORGE  What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. 9Did you not shake my hand on it uh?  JERRY  You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.  GEORGE  Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...  JERRY  You thought I was gonna get married?  GEORGE  Well, maybe not married, but...

NEWMAN  Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you.  ELAINE  I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.  NEWMAN  I knew you'd back out. ELAINE  Kramer:, are we doing a bad thing?  KRAMER  Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it.

Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?  SUSAN  Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.  GEORGE  Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?  SUSAN  Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.  GEORGE  A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.  SUSAN  Can we change the subject, please?  GEORGE  Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?  SUSAN  No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.  GEORGE  It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.  SUSAN  Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.  GEORGE  (To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.   (Jerry's) JERRY  Yeah, he seems pretty happy. ELAINE  Well, that's all that counts, I guess.  JERRY  What's the matter? ELAINE  Oh, nothin'. JERRY  Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.  ELAINE  Well, what do you want me to do? JERRY  Well, at least have some reaction to it.  ELAINE  Well, I don't. JERRY  Maybe you're a little jealous. ELAINE  Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George:?  JERRY  No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.  ELAINE  Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.  JERRY  Oh, yeah. Right. ELAINE  Yeah, right. JERRY  Lainy! ELAINE  Jerry:! JERRY  You don't wanna get married? ELAINE  Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.  JERRY  Oh, come on! ELAINE  Oh, you come on. JERRY  You're such...  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Oh, hey! JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Elaine:, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?  ELAINE  Oh, dear. KRAMER  It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry:?  JERRY  We're gonna change the system. KRAMER  Yes! ELAINE  Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.   (Outside Elaine's place) ELAINE  Oh, hello, Rabbi: Krischma. RABBI  Elaine:! Always a pleasure to see you.  ELAINE  Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.  RABBI  Elaine, often times in life there are problems, and just as often there are solutions.  ELAINE  Yeah, I suppose. RABBI  Elaine, you don't seem yourself today. You seem, if I may say, troubled.  ELAINE  No, Rabbi:, I'm not myself. RABBI  Come upstairs. We'll have a talk. AT JERRY  's apartment. George trots in after his lunch with Kiki and Big Jer is kicking back with a paper. JERRY  Hey! GEORGE  I want your honest opinion about something.  JERRY  Have I ever been less than forthright?  GEORGE  No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.  JERRY  Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?  GEORGE  All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.  JERRY  Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.  GEORGE  It's good, right? JERRY  I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.  GEORGE  You do? JERRY  Yes, I do. GEORGE  Well, I told it to Susan: before, and she didn't like it.  JERRY  Hmm. GEORGE  Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, \"Can we change the subject?\"  JERRY  See, now that I don't care for. GEORGE  Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?  JERRY  It should resolve of its own volition.  GEORGE  That's exactly what I said, except I used the word \"momentum\".  JERRY  Momentum - same thing. GEORGE  Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?  JERRY  Yeah, I know. GEORGE  Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.  JERRY  You're turning. GEORGE  Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.  JERRY  If you need more time, you should have more time.  GEORGE  What, you think I could postpone it?  JERRY  Sure you can. Why not? GEORGE  That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?  JERRY  I don't see why not. GEORGE  So, I could do that? JERRY  Sure, go ahead. GEORGE  All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.  JERRY  Spring. Of course. GEORGE  Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.  JERRY  Beautiful. GEORGE  She's not gonna like it. JERRY  No, she's not. GEORGE  You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.  JERRY  Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.  GEORGE  Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.  JERRY  Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey, hey. GEORGE  March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?  JERRY  Oh, all the way. GEORGE  You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.  JERRY  Is that so? JERRY  Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?  KRAMER  Definitely. JERRY  You're kidding? KRAMER  No, no, I would turn you in. JERRY  You would turn me in? KRAMER  Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.  JERRY  I can't believe your a friend of mine.  KRAMER  What kind of person are you going around killing people?  JERRY  Well, I am sure I had a good reason.  KRAMER  Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?  JERRY  But you know me! KRAMER  I thought I DID!  (Rabbi's apartment) ELAINE  I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.  RABBI  Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories  ELAINE  Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .  RABBI  How wonderful. ELAINE  Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.  RABBI  Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?  ELAINE  No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.  RABBI  You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.  ELAINE  Yeah, I don't know what that means.  RABBI  Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .  ELAINE  You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.  RABBI  You know my temple has many single functions.  ELAINE  No, no, it's okay. RABBI  My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps ...  ELAINE  I don't think so. RABBI  He owns a flower store. Very successful.   (Outside Coffee shop) JERRY  So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.  KRAMER  Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  JERRY  Another Café Latte? KRAMER  You better believe it. KRAMER  Since when are you so trendy? JERRY  Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Café Latte?  JERRY  I don't recall you drinking Café Latte.  KRAMER  I've been drinking Café Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.  JERRY  Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.  KRAMER  I've always wanted to see this. JERRY  You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.  KRAMER  Well, yeah, lets do it uh? JERRY  Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.  JERRY  Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.  KRAMER  Maybe I will.  (George's) GEORGE  Hi, SUSAN  How was your day? GEORGE  Good, good day. How was your day? SUSAN  Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?  GEORGE  Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.  SUSAN  Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.  GEORGE  The Lowers, really? SUSAN  You don't want to go? GEORGE  No, I want to go. SUSAN  So what did Jerry have to say? GEORGE  Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!  SUSAN  Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.  GEORGE  Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?  SUSAN  Yeah. GEORGE  Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.  SUSAN  What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?  GEORGE  No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the ...  SUSAN  If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. (crying) Say so.  GEORGE  Still marry , still marry. SUSAN  You don't love me. GEORGE  Sstill love. Still love. SUSAN  My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.  GEORGE  No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I ...It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.  SUSAN  Are you sure? GEORGE  Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.   (Monk's) JERRY  Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.  GEORGE  How did you know that? JERRY  I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.  GEORGE  I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.  JERRY  tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.  GEORGE  You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.  JERRY  Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.  GEORGE  I didn't have any sex. JERRY  You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.  GEORGE  I didn't have make-up sex. JERRY  In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.  GEORGE  Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!  WOMAN  (crying) MAN  I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'  GEORGE  Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.  MAN  Are you going to eat thoise fries?  GEORGE  This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)  JERRY  . . . Poor bastard.  (Outside Elaine's) JERRY  Good evening, Rabbi. RABBI  Good evening. And how does this evening find you?  JERRY  Well, Rabbi, well. RABBI  I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.  JERRY  Yeah, that's right. RABBI  I hope she's feeling better. JERRY  What do you mean? RABBI  She didn't tell you? JERRY  No. RABBI  Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.  JERRY  is that so? RABBI  Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.  JERRY  Really? RABBI  She came off as pretty desperate. JERRY  I didn't know any of this. RABBI  Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.  JERRY  Hum, well it all comes as news to me.   (George's apartment) G  (enters) Hi. SUSAN  Hi, how was your day? GEORGE  Good, good day. How was your day? SUSAN  Ah, it was okay. What's going on? GEORGE  Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?  SUSAN  Yeah, sure. GEORGE  You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)  SUSAN  George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.  GEORGE  Yeah? SUSAN  Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.  GEORGE  All right. (smiles behind her back)   (Elaine's) ELAINE  I've got that magazine article for you.  JERRY  You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.  ELAINE  Are you JERRY  Understand you had a little talk with him too.  ELAINE  Yeah, talked earlier. JERRY  Yes I know, I know. ELAINE  . . . What does that mean? JERRY  Nothing, nothing. ELAINE  He didn't mention . . . JERRY  Yes he did. ELAINE  He told you about our conversation?  JERRY  We had quite a little chat. ELAINE  He told you about . . . JERRY  Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.  ELAINE  He told you all that? How could he?  JERRY  It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.  ELAINE  Can he do that? JERRY  He did it. ELAINE  But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?  JERRY  That's what's so fascinating.  (Movie line) JERRY  You better finish your little café latte there. They won't let you in with it.  KRAMER  Why not? JERRY  Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.  KRAMER  Well that's stupid JERRY  That's the rule. KRAMER  Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.   (Kramer puts coffee cup into his pants)  (Rabbi's apartment) RABBI  Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.  E  Yeah... RABBI  Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?  ELAINE  No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?  RABBI  Was that a problem for you? ELAINE  Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?  RABBI  Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.  ELAINE  Mrs. Winston? RABBI  Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going \"to happen\" for you.  ELAINE  What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?  RABBI  Don Ramsey? ELAINE  You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.  RABBI  Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him...  ELAINE  my god, you didn't.  (Movie theatre) JERRY  Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me KRAMER  Oh, yow, oow Ah! USHER  Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?  KRAMER  Nothing Nothing. USHER  Whatya got? One of those Café Latte's in your shirt?  KRAMER  I don't have anything. Ask him.  (Jerry makes a silent drink gesture) USHER  All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out.  KRAMER  What?! USHER  Here you go. KRAMER  Ow  (Kramer leaves)  (Jerry's apartment)  Ex; But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.  JERRY  Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.  ELAINE  You didn't say this to George, did you?  JERRY  No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?  ELAINE  Yeah that! So, . . .  (George enters) GEORGE  Hey oh. ELAINE  GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.  GEORGE  Alright, thanks a lot. ELAINE  Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.   (Gives George a kiss) GEORGE  Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...  ELAINE  Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.  GEORGE  Well, I guess I'm getting older. ELAINE  Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan. George Yeah.  Elaine My most, just heartfelt congratulations. GEORGE  Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.  ELAINE  Yes! Yes, yes. Sure. GEORGE  Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.  ELAINE  Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. GEORGE  Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?  JERRY  Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh...  GEORGE  Nope. I wept like a baby. JERRY  What? GEORGE  Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.  JERRY  You cried? GEORGE  I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.  JERRY  Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.  KRAMER  Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.  JERRY  Suing? What for? KRAMER  The coffee was too hot. JERRY  It's supposed to be hot. KRAMER  Not THAT hot.  (At George's home. He and Susan are in bed watching TV) RABBI  (On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.  GEORGE  Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi: from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.  RABBI  A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George:. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm. THE END>",

ELAINE  I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.  GEORGE  Ya know, I was just a little surprised.  JERRY  Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?  GEORGE  What about all the loser stuff? ELAINE  I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said \"I've never seen you looser\".  JERRY  I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.  GEORGE  (Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.  JERRY  Where you going? GEORGE  I'm going shopping with Susan. ELAINE  What kind of shopping? GEORGE  Clothes shopping. ELAINE  Where are you going? GEORGE  Ross'. ELAINE  Oh that's a nice store. GEORGE  Yeah, it's her uncle's. JERRY  Discount? GEORGE  (As he leaves) One would hope.  (Jackie Child's Office)  (Kramer is sitting across from Jackie) KRAMER  So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off   and bought this cafe latte. JACKIE  (Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?  KRAMER  Yeah that's right. JACKIE  Half milk, half coffee? KRAMER  Yeah. JACKIE  Hm Hm. You take a sip? KRAMER  Yes I did. JACKIE  Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip   it in your normal fashion? KRAMER  No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.  JACKIE  Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?  KRAMER  Well I think I take a normal sip. JACKIE  O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?  KRAMER  Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater.   So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in. JACKIE  Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.  KRAMER  Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?  JACKIE  Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them.   This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your   constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.  KRAMER  It's definitely preposterous. JACKIE  So. Then what happened? KRAMER  Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and   I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me. JACKIE  Was there a top on it? KRAMER  Yeah. JACKIE  Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?  KRAMER  No. They put the top on. JACKIE  And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?   (Kramer motions that he did not make the top) JACKIE  (To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World.   Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top.   Have you been to the doctor? KRAMER  Ah No no, I haven't. JACKIE  (To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment   for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me. KRAMER  So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.  JACKIE  Jackie. KRAMER  Jackie. I mean, we have a chance? JACKIE  Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you   gonna walk outta there a rich man.  (Ross' clothing store)  (Susan is holding a bright red shirt up to George) GEORGE  I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.  SUSAN  Well you could use a little flash.  GEORGE  All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot   of woman that would love to be in your position right now. SUSAN  Name one. MR ROSS  So, you find anything? SUSAN  Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.  MR ROSS  I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe I'll see you in a couple of   weeks. SUSAN  O.K. SALESMAN  Excuse me Mr Ross.  (George notices the security guard standing near the front door)  GEORGE  See now this I don't get. SUSAN  What? GEORGE  The security guard. SUSAN  What about him? GEORGE  Why does he have to stand? SUSAN  Because he's a security guard. GEORGE  But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day?   That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.  SUSAN  George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.  GEORGE  Aren't you concerned about the security guard?  SUSAN  Not really. (Walks away) GEORGE  (Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What   kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man   has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.  SUSAN  All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you   think?  (Elaine and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.) JERRY  So ah, what did you do last night?  ELAINE  Nothing. JERRY  I know nothing, but what did you actually do?  ELAINE  Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.  JERRY  Wow. That really is nothing. ELAINE  I told ya.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. ELAINE  Hey. JERRY  What are you all dressed up for? KRAMER  Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.  JERRY  Oh yeah, how's that looking? KRAMER  Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one   coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.  ELAINE  That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote?   I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.  KRAMER  Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.  JERRY  Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.  KRAMER  Oh I can be quite litigious. ELAINE  What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there   coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot. KRAMER  Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.  ELAINE  (Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.   (Sounds of knocking in the background on Kramer's door) KRAMER  Hey Maestro! MAESTRO  Ah, Kramer. KRAMER  I'm in here. How's it going. MAESTRO  Fine. JERRY  Hi Bob.  (Kramer coughs purposely and motions toward maestro with his head)  JERRY  (Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.  KRAMER  Well, this is a surprise ha? MAESTRO  I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed   to be great stuff. It's all herbal. KRAMER  Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you   believe this Maestro? MAESTRO  It's nothing. KRAMER  Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.  MAESTRO  Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.  KRAMER  Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.  JERRY  I hear it's ah beautiful there. MAESTRO  Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's   really nothing available. JERRY  (Surprised) Huh?  (Elaine enters from bathroom) MAESTRO  (Seeing Elaine) Oh! ELAINE  Hello. MAESTRO  Well Hello. And who might you be? ELAINE  I might be Elaine. JERRY  This is a, Bob Cobb. KRAMER  Maestro. ELAINE  Oh, Maestro. MAESTRO  It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaine's hand)  ELAINE  Enchante. MAESTRO AND ELAINE  Well I have to be going. ELAINE  Jinx buy me a coke. MAESTRO  Oh. Love it when that happeneds. ELAINE  I know I know. That is so ahh ......  MAESTRO  Coincidental. ELAINE  Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys. MAESTRO  Ciao.  (Elaine and Maestro leave) KRAMER  Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.   (Kramer shuts the door and stares at Jerry) KRAMER  You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.  JERRY  Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?  KRAMER  That's right. JERRY  Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.  KRAMER  Why? JERRY  Because it's a stupid thing to be called.  KRAMER  Jerry he's a conductor. JERRY  Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.  KRAMER  Well, he's still a conductor. JERRY  Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.  KRAMER  Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.   (Kramer makes like a conductor and makes a classic Kramer sound)   (Monks Cafe. George and Jerry are sitting across from each other)  JERRY  New shirt? GEORGE  Yeah. You like it. JERRY  No, not particularly. GEORGE  Why, the color? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Too flashy? JERRY  Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?  GEORGE  (Obviously lying) No. JERRY  (Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.  GEORGE  Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you   that they make the security guard just stand there all day?  JERRY  No. GEORGE  See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense   the slightest human suffering. JERRY  Are you sensing anything right now?  GEORGE  Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in   one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?  JERRY  Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.  GEORGE  What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take?   Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up)   Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!  JERRY  Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.  GEORGE  Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be   very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk   with him. JERRY  I know you will.  (Kramer enters and sits next to Jerry) KRAMER  Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.  GEORGE  Who? JERRY  His lawyer. KRAMER  Yeah, Java World wants to settle. JERRY  What? KRAMER  Yeah, I'm gonna be rich. JERRY  Why are they settling? KRAMER  Cause their afraid of bad publicity.  JERRY  All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?  KRAMER  Yeah that's right. GEORGE  (Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!   (Restaurant. Maestro and Elaine are talking) MAESTRO  And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany.  ELAINE  Uh ha. MAESTRO  And I fell in love with this house.   (Waiter approaches) WAITER  Are you ready to order? ELAINE  Oh God. What are you getting Bob?  (Maestro looks at Elaine with an annoyed look on his face) MAESTRO  Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.   (Maestro puts his head in his hand. He is visibly upset) MAESTRO  You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I   preferred to be called Maestro. ELAINE  Excuse me? MAESTRO  Well, ya know I am a conductor. ELAINE  Yeah, so? MAESTRO  Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because   he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.  ELAINE  Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he   was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called   him Lenny. MAESTRO  I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social   situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said   \"Hello Maestro, how about a beer\". O.K. So that's a fact. ELAINE  Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)  (Jerry's apartment. Jerry is at the refrigerator getting orange juice.)   (Kramer enters frantically) KRAMER  Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).  JERRY  What do you mean? KRAMER  Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it   healed it. JERRY  So? KRAMER  So? My lawsuit. I'm finished. JERRY  I thought they wanted to settle. KRAMER  Well what happens if they want to see it?  JERRY  Then you're in a lot of trouble. KRAMER  Yeah!!  (Ross' clothing store. Guard is standing near entrance. George enters.)  GEORGE  (To guard) Tired? GUARD  No. GEORGE  How come uh, no chair? GUARD  What? GEORGE  I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.  GUARD  I don't need a chair. GEORGE  No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well   proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?  GUARD  Nope. GEORGE  Would you like a chair? GUARD  I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.  GEORGE  Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?  GUARD  Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.  GEORGE  That's exactly my point. GUARD  Well who wouldn't? GEORGE  Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find   you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of   pleasure. Call me crazy.  (Back seat of a cab. Jackie and Kramer) JACKIE  You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you   to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the   doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.  KRAMER  I guess I screwed up huh Jackie? JACKIE  Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm   anyway? KRAMER  The Maestro. JACKIE  The who? What are you talking about Maestro?  KRAMER  My friend he's a conductor. JACKIE  Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?  KRAMER  Well my stomach was burning. JACKIE  I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.  KRAMER  Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.  JACKIE  Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read   the instructions? KRAMER  Well I ... JACKIE  (interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.  KRAMER  I'm sorry Jackie. JACKIE  (To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.  KRAMER  (Motions with his head) Yeah, get over.   (Elaine and Jerry walking on the sidewalk in NYC) JERRY  Did you have a good time? ELAINE  Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was   writing 'The Requiem'. JERRY  (Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.  ELAINE  Really? JERRY  So what about the \"Maestro\" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.  ELAINE  Yeah, I called him Maestro. JERRY  You didn't mind? ELAINE  Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.  JERRY  O.K. from now on I want you to call me \"Jerry the Great\".  ELAINE  I am not calling you \"Jerry the Great\".  JERRY  Why not you call him Maestro. ELAINE  He is a Maestro. JERRY  Well, I'm great. ELAINE  So you say. JERRY  What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?  ELAINE  Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited. JERRY  You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky   he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.  ELAINE  Why? JERRY  I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.  ELAINE  Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.  JERRY  In all of Tuscany? I wonder.  (Office of a Java World building) MR STAR  I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it.  MR BURNS  How do we know how severe the burns are? Why don't we have him   examined by a doctor. MS. JORDAN  Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better. This thing gets into   the paper it will kill us. MR STAR  All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all of our stores.   (Secretary beeps) MR STAR  (Answering secretary) Yes?  (Heard over the speaker) SECRETARY  Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.   (To intercom) MR STAR  Send them in.  (Mr. Star opens door to let Jackie and Kramer in) MR STAR  Gentleman.  (Kramer and Jackie enter Mr. Star's office) MR STAR  Gentleman come in. Now we don't want to take up much of your time. Let's   make this short and sweet. We're prepared to offer you all the free coffee you   want in any of our stores throughout North America and Europe, Plus..  KRAMER  (Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!  (Jackie and Kramer in the back of a cab) JACKIE  I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?  KRAMER  No. JACKIE  I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.  KRAMER  Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.  JACKIE  Free coffee? KRAMER  Yeah. JACKIE  I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own   damn coffee. I wanted to hear what came after that \"Plus\". KRAMER  Well I didn't hear any Plus. JACKIE  20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.   (Kramer spots a Java World) KRAMER  Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm   gonna get myself a free cafe latte.  (Kramer tramples over Jackie to get out of the cab)  (Jerry and Elaine are walking down the street and hear music approaching)  ELAINE  Hey. Hi Maestro.  (Maestro makes like a conductor waiving his hands. Elaine joins in to finish the song)  MAESTRO  Beethoven's 7th. ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  Hey you know we were just talking about you.  MAESTRO  Oh yeah? JERRY  Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses   available in Tuscany? MAESTRO  You didn't find one, did you? JERRY  No. I'm not really looking. MAESTRO  Nor should you. JERRY  So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?  MAESTRO  The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.  JERRY  I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?  MAESTRO  It's booked solid! ELAINE  It's BOOKED Jerry! JERRY  How'd you get yours? MAESTRO  Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some   Verdi.  (Elaine starts to sing in Italian. Maestro and Elaine drive away)  JERRY  Maybe I'll check out France.  (George walks towards Jerry) JERRY  Hey George, do you believe this guy?  GEORGE  Who? JERRY  Bob Cobb. GEORGE  Bob Cobb? JERRY  You know, the Maestro. GEORGE  Oh I missed the Maestro? JERRY  Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.  GEORGE  Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?  JERRY  No. GEORGE  So what do you care?  (George walks away leaving Jerry standing there by himself)   (Monk's cafe. George and Jerry are sitting at the booth) JERRY  I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of   Tuscany. GEORGE  Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you   know how big Tuscany is? JERRY  I have no idea. GEORGE  It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.  JERRY  Oh, no way it's that big. GEORGE  It's a big region. JERRY  Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?  GEORGE  I don't know why I bother even talking to you.  JERRY  Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.  GEORGE  All right.  (George and Jerry hold there arms up in a truce) GEORGE  So I spoke to the security guard. JERRY  Yeah and? GEORGE  Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair,   he'd sit. JERRY  So are you gonna get him a chair? GEORGE  Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.  JERRY  Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a   back or without. GEORGE  Oh I think I'd go for the back. JERRY  Swivel? GEORGE  I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What   do you think of those. JERRY  I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a   kitchen chair that would have been perfect. GEORGE  You mean one of those vinyl things?  JERRY  Yes. GEORGE  Vinyl yeah, maybe. JERRY  How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a   minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.  (Jerry leaves the booth headed for the phone in the back of the cafe)  GEORGE  Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.   (In Maestro's car, he and Elaine are driving and singing Finiculi, Finicula)   (On the street in the city, George and Jerry are talking) JERRY  Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.  GEORGE  What do you think about a rocking chair?   (Camera shifts to inside a Java World and Kramer is exiting at the door)  KRAMER  (Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes,   it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here.   If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm   gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.   (Kramer exits and runs into Jerry and George) JERRY  Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?  KRAMER  Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm   entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.  JERRY  That's it? KRAMER  That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem.   Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure. JERRY  You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.  KRAMER  Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.  JERRY  You're racing! KRAMER  Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.   (Kramer walks extremely fast away from Jerry and George first putting the contract   into his jacket and then fixes his tie all while still walking extremely fast)   (Dark room. Elaine and Maestro are kissing) ELAINE  (Passionately) Oh Bob! Bob!  (Maestro is insulted and pulls away) ELAINE  (Correcting herself) Maestro!  (Maestro begins kissing Elaine again)  (Ross' clothing store. George carries in a rocking chair) CLERK  (Noticing George with the rocking chair) Excuse me. Can I help you?  GEOGE  Nope. Just a, giving a chair to the security guard.  CLERK  Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?  (George motions for the clerk to approach him) GEORGE  What's your name? CLERK  Evan Fayne. GEORGE  I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this   whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.  CLERK  I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.  GEORGE  Innocent mistake.  (George gives the chair to the security guard) GEORGE  Well, here you go. What do you think?  GUARD  Mr. Ross says this is O.K.? GEORGE  Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.   (Guard sits in the chair) GUARD  Not bad. Not bad at all.  (Dark room in the back of an Italian restaurant.) JERRY  Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.  GIGGIO  Si, Si, imma Giggio. JERRY  Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.  GIGGIO  Si, Si Poppy. JERRY  Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?  GIGGIO  Si, the house in Tuscana. JERRY  Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?  GIGGIO  Si. Two million lira. You give me the check.  JERRY  I didn't actually want to rent it.  GIGGIO  The keys, here are the keys. You give me the check. Two million   lira. Seventeen hundred Americana. Molto generoso.  (A man approaches Mr. Giggio and whispers in his ear.) GIGGIO  (To the man) Si, Si.  (Jerry watches the man walk away and appears to be very frightened)  JERRY  So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if   there were houses there to rent. GIGGIO  Si. (hods up the keys) Thissa one!. Capiche?   (Ross' clothing store. The employees are being held up at gun point. The   camera moves from the right to the left. There is a masked man taking the money   from the cash register. As the camera moves all the way to the left of the store,   you see the security guard fast asleep in his new chair)  (At the window of a house in Tuscany. Elaine and Maestro are talking.   There is a lady singing in Italian in the background) ELAINE  It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.  MAESTRO  I told you, it's paradise. ELAINE  You're right Maestro.  (The sound of a car horn is heard in the background. A cab driver is yelling   in Italian. Elaine and Maestro go to the window on the other side of the room   to see what is going on. We see the cab.) KRAMER  Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.   (Jerry falls out of the back seat of the cab.) JERRY  You didn't have to push me. KRAMER  I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?  JERRY  75,000 lira. KRAMER  75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?  JERRY  Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.  KRAMER  Oh, conversion rate, oh. JERRY  You know I don't even know why I brought you.  KRAMER  Nobody put a gun to your head.  (They look up and see the place) JERRY  Not bad! KRAMER  Yeah!   THE END>",

OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.  JAMES  Hot date last night? ELAINE  I wish. JAMES  A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe you're waking up alone.  ELAINE  Really? Thank you, wake up service . . . person.  JAMES  Call me James. ELAINE  Oh, all right, James. He he he.  (Monks) GEORGE  Your wake up guy asked you out? ELAINE  Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,  JERRY  I don't know. Blind date? ELAINE  What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.  JERRY  Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.  ELAINE  At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.  JERRY  I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.  ELAINE  Ah. . . GEORGE  Now you're off on a topic. JERRY  You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.  ELAINE  Uh hu. JERRY  Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.  GEORGE  You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.  ELAINE  I think she'd figure it out.  (waitress places plates on the table) ELAINE  What? What is this? JERRY  Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit. ELAINE  Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?  JERRY  A healthy person. GEORGE  (rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.  JERRY  Oh, sorry GEORGE  Boy, it stings.  (Yankee Stadium) WILHELM  George, have you seen Morgan? GEORGE  No. WILHELM  He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?  GEORGE  No, not that I know of. (winks) WILHELM  Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.  GEORGE  Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)  WILHELM  I understand.  (Jerry's apartment) JERRY  I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.  ELAINE  I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.  JERRY  You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?  ELAINE  I think I can tell. JERRY  Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?  ELAINE  Twenty-five percent. JERRY  Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.  ELAINE  You're way off. JERRY  Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.  ELAINE  So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?  JERRY  UNDATEABLE! ELAINE  Then how are all these people getting together?  JERRY  Alcohol. ELAINE  (to George who is winking) What is your problem?  GEORGE  No problem here. ELAINE  You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.  GEORGE  I had no idea. ELAINE  Right there. Right there. You just did it again.  GEORGE  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.  ELAINE  You're eye still hurts? GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.  JERRY  Pulp couldn't make it across the table.  GEORGE  Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?  JERRY  Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.  GEORGE  Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.  ELAINE  What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?  GEORGE  Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hi guys. JERRY  Hi, KRAMER  Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?  GEORGE  Yeah. KRAMER  And Buck Showalter's? GEORGE  It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.  KRAMER  Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.  GEORGE  Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)  KRAMER  No, of course not. (winks back)  (Sports Memorabilia Shop) KRAMER  You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.  STEINBRENNER  I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.  KRAMER  Why? STEINBRENNER  What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something.   (Yankee Stadium) GEORGE  Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan? MM  Hello. MORGAN  Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card?  GEORGE  Birthday card? MORGAN  Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for me to sign.  GEORGE  Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.  MORGAN  Fine. I'll be back after my massage.  GEORGE  Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)   (Monk's - Elaine sitting alone) ELAINE  Hello. JAMES  Elaine? ELAINE  James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!  (Old Homestead Steak House) HOLLY  I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before.  JERRY  Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.  HOLLY  . . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .  JERRY  Well, no, I'm not one of those. HOLLY  When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.  JERRY  Grandma Memma? HOLLY  Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.  JERRY  No, I think I would have remembered Memma.  HOLLY  Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.  WAITER  Ready? HOLLY  I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,  JERRY  What do you recommend besides the steak?  WAITER  The lamb chops are good. JERRY  Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?  WAITER  It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola.  JERRY  You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.  WAITER  . . . Thank you. JERRY  (mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?   (Outside of Monk's - James unties his dogs) JAMES  Hey you, hey you. ELAINE  Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs? JAMES  Yeah, you know, when you live alone, you're dogs are all you have. Do you like dogs?  ELAINE  (mind's voice from - ... ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !  ELAINE  Dogs. Oh I love dogs. JAMES  Boys, this is Elaine. . . . Sorry, they're usually very friendly. Hey!   (Yankee Stadium) GEORGE  Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?  MORGAN  I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.  GEORGE  Really? MORGAN  Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch.  GEORGE  Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.  MORGAN  I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off.  GEORGE  Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.  MORGAN  Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card?  GEORGE  Ah, not yet. MORGAN  Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.  GEORGE  Yes sir!  (Jerry's apartment) ELAINE  I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.  JERRY  Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?  ELAINE  Huh huh. JERRY  Did she mention anything about our lunch?  ELAINE  Uh, kind of. JERRY  What do you mean, \"kind of.\"? ELAINE  I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.  JERRY  What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.  ELAINE  You got that right. JERRY  But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?  ELAINE  Um uh. JERRY  What is she making? ELAINE  I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.  JERRY  Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.   (Kramer's door - George knocks) KRAMER  Ah, Mr. Weatherbee. GEORGE  You got the Yankee envelope? KRAMER  Sure do. GEORGE  oh, KRAMER  Here you go. GEORGE  Hey, he, KRAMER  You'll be pleased to see what's inside.  GEORGE  What is this? KRAMER  You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.  GEORGE  Who told you to sell the card? KRAMER  You did. GEORGE  No I didn't! KRAMER  No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)  GEORGE  I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.  KRAMER  Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .  GEORGE  Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)  KRAMER  Look, do you want me to get it back or not?  GEORGE  (holds eyes wide open) Get it back!   (Holly's apartment) ELAINE  Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?  HOLLY  They're grandma Memma's. ELAINE  Oh, I don't remember them. HOLLY  Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions.  ELAINE  Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?  HOLLY  Everybody like mutton? JERRY  Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.   (Hospital room) KRAMER  That you Bobby? BOBBY KRAMER  Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.  BOBBY  Sure do. Mister. KRAMER  Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.  BOBBY  Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world.  KRAMER  Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.  BOBBY  Paul O'Neill. KRAMER  All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.  BOBBY  Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that?  KRAMER  For you he would. BOBBY  Would he hit two home runs? KRAMER  Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.  BOBBY  I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again.  KRAMER  Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.   (Holly's apartment) ELAINE  What about this candelabra? HOLLY  Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.  JERRY  Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.  HOLLY  That is so funny. Did you just make that up?  JERRY  I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)  HOLLY  That was in Grandma's study. ELAINE  What did you do, ransack the place after she died?  JERRY  This is some FINE mutton. ELAINE  I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?  JERRY  Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)  ELAINE  It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.   (On the street - dogs following Elaine) ELAINE  Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.   (Holly's) HOLLY  Where are the napkins? JERRY  What? HOLLY  Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?  JERRY  I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?  HOLLY  You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.   (On the street dogs chasing Elaine) ELAINE  Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a  (Jame's apartment) JERRY  Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?  ELAINE  Did you do with the dogs? JERRY  Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?  ELAINE  These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.  JERRY  Why were dogs chasing you? ELAINE  They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.  JERRY  I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.  ELAINE  We'll have to sleep head to toe. JERRY  Head to toe? ELAINE  Head to toe.  (The next morning at Jame's) ELAINE  Hey, wake up. It's 8:30 you were supposed to walk me up at 7:15.  JERRY  I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.  ELAINE  You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?  JERRY  I'll make them later. Uh.  (Mr. Morgan's - he's asleep on the couch)  (Yankee Stadium - George's office) WILHELM  Have you seen Morgan? GEORGE  He's not here? WILHELM  No, He's late. GEORGE  It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.  WILHELM  Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.  GEORGE  . . . gone?  (Monk's) JERRY  It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.  GEORGE  I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.  ELAINE  Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.  GEORGE  Napkins? ELAINE  I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.  JERRY  Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.  ELAINE  They were? JERRY  Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.  ELAINE  Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.  GEORGE  What exactly is mutton? JERRY  I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?  ELAINE  Oh, I must have left it at Jame's JERRY  You spent the night at James's? Did we?  ELAINE  Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.  JERRY  Reversed positions? ELAINE  Yeah, you know, head to toe. JERRY  So what your genitals are still lined up.  ELAINE  No, because I slept with my back to him.   (long pause - no comment from the guys)  (Yankee Stadium) KRAMER  Mr. O'Neill? O'NEILL  Yeah. KRAMER  Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.  O'NEILL  I can give you an autograph there, but my pen's kind of screwed up. You'd only like half a \"P\" or something.  KRAMER  No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.  O'NEILL  Sure, I could help you there. KRAMER  Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.  O'NEILL  Say what? KRAMER  You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.  O'NEILL  You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home runs?  KRAMER  Yeah, well, no good? O'NEILL  Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get two from?  KRAMER  Two is better than one. O'NEILL  That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter.  KRAMER  Well, Babe Ruth did it. O'NEILL  He did not. KRAMER  Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?  O'NEILL  I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise two.  KRAMER  Well, maybe I did overextend myself.  O'NEILL  How the heck did you get in here anyway?   (James's) JAMES  (on phone) Oh, hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 6:30 clients because of you. . . . Yeah, well why did you have to stick your feet in my face? . . . Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on. . . . (to dogs) Fellas!   (Hospital) TV  The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.  KRAMER  It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?  BOBBY  After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run.   (Jerry's) HOLLY  (from buzzer) It's Holly. JERRY  Yeah. Come on up. TV  And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep right field and it's gone.   (Hospital) KRAMER  Yeah. TV  A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing.  KRAMER  OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT! BOBBY  One more to go.  (Jerry's)  (Holly enters) JERRY  Hey. What's all this? HOLLY  I decided I was going to make you dinner.  JERRY  I thought we were going out. HOLLY  Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.  JERRY  Franco? HOLLY  Your butcher, down the street. JERRY  I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.  HOLLY  A little. JERRY  That is so Franco.  (Hospital) TV  Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill.  KRAMER  You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.  KRAMER  He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.  TV  \"Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . .  KRAMER  Come on Come on! TV  . . . third being waived in. KRAMER  GO! GO!! TV  . . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead.  KRAMER  An In The Park Home Run! BOBBY  Yeay! KRAMER  All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)  TV  That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez.  BOBBY  Hey, ... KRAMER  Huh? BOBBY  ... that's not a home run. (grabs frame)  KRAMER  Yeah, maybe not technically, but ...  BOBBY  You said he'd hit two home runs. KRAMER  Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!  BOBBY  Well, you're not taking that card.  KRAMER  Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that ...   (Jerry's) HOLLY  So, is the chop the way you like it?  JERRY  I usually like mine with an angioplasty.   (stuffs meat in sofa)  (Elaine enters) ELAINE  You know something really stinks to high h... Holly! What are you doing here?  JERRY  What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.  ELAINE  I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.  HOLLY  What about the napkins? ELAINE  I didn't take your napkins. HOLLY  Then who did? ELAINE  Ask Jerry. JERRY  We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.   (George's office, Yankee Stadium) WILHELM  I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?  MORGAN  No sir, George never gave it to me.  GEORGE  No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .   (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hi, WILHELM  What's this? KRAMER  Oh, it's a birthday card. KRAMER  (to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.  WILHELM  George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?  KRAMER  And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.  WILHELM  Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.  MORGAN  Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass?   (Jerry's)  (James enters with his dogs) ELAINE  Uh, this is,... HOLLY  Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?  JAMES  Oh, bandanas, aren't they cute? HOLLY  You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!  JERRY  Hey, what happened to my jacket? JAMES  Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed some strange meat in the pocket.  HOLLY  Was it mutton? JAMES  Could have been. HOLLY  Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?   (Dogs climbing on sofa) JERRY  Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.  (Steinbrenner's office)  (George enters) GEORGE  You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?  STEINBRENNER  Yes, George, please, come in, come in.  STEINBRENNER  Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing.  GEORGE  Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.  STEINBRENNER  Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it.  GEORGE  Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir. STEINBRENNER  You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job.  GEORGE  Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.  STEINBRENNER  Stop it George, he's out, you're in.  STEINBRENNER  A lot more work you know. GEORGE  I know. STEINBRENNER  A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.  GEORGE  I know. STEINBRENNER  Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve.  GEORGE  That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .  STEINBRENNER  You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people go over the years. Yogi Berra, Lou Pinella, Bucky Dent, Billy Martin, Dallas Green, Dick Houser, Bill Virdon, Billy Martin, Scott Marrow, Billy Martin, Bob Lemmon, Billy Martin, Gene Michael, Buck Showalter, ... uh, tut!, . . .George, you didn't hear that from me. (George exits) . . . George! THE END>",

How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna keep asking - How much did you lose by? I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like... now..now..now...! It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything, I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold. If I had a pimple, I would've won.   (Monk's Restaurant - Jerry, George, Elaine) JERRY  (to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J. Peterman catalog.  JERRY  (to George) Get this one - \"I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest\".  GEORGE  This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.  ELAINE  Yeah. What do you do all day? GEORGE  Not that much. ELAINE  uh-uh. JERRY  I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.  GEORGE  Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.  JERRY  How do you pull that off? GEORGE  I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).  ELAINE  Yeah, you do! He looks very busy! JERRY  Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah! GEORGE  I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)  ELAINE  (laughs) JERRY  So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?  ELAINE  No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.  JERRY  What marathon runner? ELAINE  You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...  JERRY  Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!  ELAINE  Yeah, that's him. JERRY  He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?  ELAINE  Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)  JERRY  How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?  ELAINE  Ah, I know. I know...! JERRY  I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm   clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...  ELAINE  Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.  JERRY  Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.  ELAINE  What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.  JERRY  You gotta wake him up! ELAINE  Eh...he'll get up...  (A woman passes by with a baby) ELAINE  Hi, Judy. JUDY  Hi, Elaine. How are you? ELAINE  Fine. (laughs)  (woman leaves) JERRY  I've seen her in your building. ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  I didn't know she was married. ELAINE  (whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face)   Don't say anything to anybody. JERRY  Whom I gonna tell? ELAINE  I know, it's just something you have to say...   (George's office at the Yankee Stadium)  (George is reading a newspaper when he hears a fly that lands on his desk. He tries to kill it   with the paper but misses. Mr. Wilhelm comes in. George switches to annoyed-mode)  WILHELM  George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items,   but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very   annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)   (George hears the fly again. It lands on the wall and he starts bashing it with the file.   Mr. Wilhelm sees George hitting the wall with the budget file and shakes his head, worried)   (Jerry's apartment - Jerry, George) JERRY  He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?  GEORGE  I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.  JERRY  My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back   on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink)   Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock. KRAMER  Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.  JERRY  What do you do? KRAMER  I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and...   (makes sound with the lips - \"pop!\") ...I get up! JERRY  Always works? KRAMER  It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal   mechanism. It knows what time it is. GEORGE  uh-uh. What's with the bucket? KRAMER  Lomez, he sold me his hot tub. JERRY  Hot tub? KRAMER  Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)  GEORGE  You put a hot tub... in your living room?  KRAMER  Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating,   soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)  GEORGE  Is that tolerable? KRAMER  Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy) JERRY  Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?  KRAMER  Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)  GEORGE  He uh...doesn't have any running water?  JERRY  I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.   (Monk's Restaurant - Jerry)  (Elaine and Jean-Paul come in) ELAINE  Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul. JERRY  Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.  JEAN-PAUL  Nice to meet you. JERRY  Sorry about the Olympics. JEAN-PAUL  Me too. (disappointed) ELAINE  Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended.   I can't...come up with anything for this thing. JERRY  Ah...catalog writer's block? ELAINE  Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)  (Elaine leaves) JERRY  (pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?  JEAN-PAUL  Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.  JERRY  AM/PM. JEAN-PAUL  Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.  JERRY  Ah...the volume. JEAN-PAUL  Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.  JERRY  Ah, separate knob. JEAN-PAUL  Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)  JERRY  Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.  JEAN-PAUL  Oh, please, man, please! JERRY  Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.   (Elaine returns) JERRY  Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?  ELAINE  Jerry... JERRY  It's a simple question... ELAINE  I've got an alarm, ok? JERRY  That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?  JEAN-PAUL  Flight to Cleveland? ELAINE  It works. JERRY  Elaine... ELAINE  It... works!  (George's office at the Yankee Stadium)  (George is doing the newspaper's crossword. The pen stops working.)  GEORGE  Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)   (George switches to annoyed-mode again) WILHELM  George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.  GEORGE  Well...I've got a lot to do! WILHELM  George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.   (George acts annoyed) WILHELM  I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from   the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a   good time.(George acts like \"ok, you're the boss\")  (Jerry's apartment - Jerry)  (Elaine comes in) ELAINE  Hey. Sorry I'm late. JERRY  You're 40 minutes late. What happened?  ELAINE  I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?  JERRY  No. ELAINE  What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?  JERRY  Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.  ELAINE  uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?  JERRY  Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race,   he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!  ELAINE  Oh are you?! JERRY  Yes I am. ELAINE  Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!  JERRY  Yeah, I know that! ELAINE  Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that   Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but   I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!  JERRY  I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking   him up! ELAINE  Hey, Jean-Paul. JERRY  Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?  JEAN-PAUL  Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!  KRAMER  (smelling) What's burning? ELAINE  Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)  JERRY  What happened? ELAINE  Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.  KRAMER  This was set for 2 minutes. See?  (Jerry raises his hands in the air, worried) ELAINE  (pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!  JEAN-PAUL  You miss-set the timer... ELAINE  (leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right,   listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.  JEAN-PAUL  Ok. ELAINE  (to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?  JERRY  Yeah. I hope so ?! ELAINE  Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)  JERRY  Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over   this whole operation! KRAMER  Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.  JERRY  I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.  KRAMER  Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the   tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!  (Kramer's hot tub)  (The water is at 105.F degrees. Kramer takes his robe off and goes inside)  KRAMER  (relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)   (in a bar - George and 3 other men, drinking) CLAYTON  ...'till this bastard over here says: \"let's call the sons o'bitches and go visit 'em on   New York!\" (the 3 men laugh) GEORGE  (smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.  GARDNER  I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch   in the front office. Wilhelm, I think his name. GEORGE  Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah... GARDNER  He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us bastards out on the town.  \"that son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store   for him!\". (the 3 men laugh once more) ZEKE  Finish your drink? GEORGE  Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost. ZEKE  Let's get that bastard bring us another round! (waves to bartender)  CLAYTON  You a big drinker, George? GEORGE  Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can   hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)  (Kramer's hot tub)  (The water is now at 53 degrees. Kramer is asleep inside and he's all trembling. He wakes up,   frozen, making trembling sounds, reaches for his robe and puts it on while in the tub.)   (Monk's Restaurant - Jerry, Jean-Paul) JERRY  Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that   tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you   have chosen to stay... is uh... JEAN-PAUL  What are you saying? JERRY  I'm saying \"get the hell outta there\"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable,   you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call,   Jean-Paul! A wake-up call! JEAN-PAUL  Wake-up call... JERRY  These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin'   to make that call! (George comes in) JEAN-PAUL  No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.  GEORGE  Hey, you bastards. JERRY  Hey, how was the meeting? GEORGE  I really like those sons of bitches.  JERRY  Sons of bitches? GEORGE  Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch.   Yeah, it's like uh...\"boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!\" (laughs)  JEAN-PAUL  Really?! GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)   (Kramer walks in wearing winter coat, scarf, cap, gloves... They all look at him very surprised)  KRAMER  Heeeeey... JERRY  How many sweaters you got on? KRAMER  Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.  GEORGE  What's goin'on? KRAMER  I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees.   I can't get my core temperature back up! JERRY  Your core temperature? KRAMER  (to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.  JEAN-PAUL  Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)   (inside an airplane - the 3 men)  (They are calling George at the Yankee Stadium, while they're drinking and laughing in the plane)  GEORGE  Hello? CLAYTON  uh...is that you, George? GEORGE  (laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?  CLAYTON  Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? 30 000 feet above your head, you   bastard! (the 3 laugh and howl) GEORGE  What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against   FAA regulation? CLAYTON  (to the other 2 men) Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!  GEORGE  Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys   can't wait to kick your butts! ZEKE  (to Clayton) When's that bastard comin' to Houston?  CLAYTON  Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' to Houston!  GEORGE  You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you   bastards are running things. CLAYTON  Hey, uh, speak up, George, I can't hear ya!  GEORGE  (Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is   ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!   (Mr.Wilhelm comes running, takes the phone from George and hangs up)  WILHELM  George! George, get a hold of yourself!  GEORGE  Mr.Wilhelm... WILHELM  What's the matter with you?! GEORGE  Well I-I...  (Elaine's office - Elaine)  (She's trying to think of a story for the shoes while she's at the computer)  ELAINE  (thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu...   (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing   it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)   (Elaine's building - Jean-Paul, Judy with baby) JEAN-PAUL  Hello. JUDY  Hello. JEAN-PAUL  I'm a friend of Elaine's. JUDY  Oh, hi. JEAN-PAUL  (looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager   comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)   (Judy goes away angry and Jean-Paul is surprised by that) MANAGER  Whatta hell are you doin' harassing my tenants?  JEAN-PAUL  (smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.  MANAGER  All right, that's it! (grabs Jean-Paul and gets him out) Let's go!  JEAN-PAUL  What...but I got a race tomorrow!  (Jerry's apartment at night- Kramer)  (Kramer is lying on Jerry's sofa, \"fully\" dressed and covered with a blanket. Jerry and George   come in) GEORGE  Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!  JERRY  Oh whatta hell is goin'on?! KRAMER  Yeah, I turned up the heat. JERRY  Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)  KRAMER  I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.  GEORGE  Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?  KRAMER  Uh? Oh that must be it. GEORGE  It's huge! KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.   (Kramer leaves. The phone rings and Jerry picks it up) JERRY  Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)  GEORGE  (Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?  JERRY  I got the call...! GEORGE  Jean-Paul? JERRY  (stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)   (hotel - Jerry, Jean-Paul. Sitting in different beds) JERRY  Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.  JEAN-PAUL  Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)  JERRY  All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 6:50...   volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to?   Top 40, classical... JEAN-PAUL  Man, whatever! (annoyed) JERRY  How about adult contemporary? JEAN-PAUL  Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)  JERRY  All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now...   the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials) JEAN-PAUL  Yes, yes, the wake-up guy. MAN  (on the phone) Front desk...? JERRY  Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.  MAN  Yes sir. JERRY  That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...  MAN  Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.  JERRY  I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.  MAN  Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.  JERRY  Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...  MAN  Are you through? (annoyed) JERRY  ...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)   (Jerry pauses thinking) JERRY  humm... JEAN-PAUL  What is it...? JERRY  I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)  JEAN-PAUL  No, no. JERRY  (gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!  JEAN-PAUL  Man, he doesn't got \"in\" for you. JERRY  What if he doesn't call now out of spite?  JEAN-PAUL  It is his job!  (Jerry sits down) JERRY  (pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)  JEAN-PAUL  For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)   (Elaine's apartment)  (Elaine comes in) ELAINE  Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?!   Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine. JERRY'S MACHINE  I'm not here, leave a message. ELAINE  Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)   (She leaves her apartment and knocks on Judy's door) ELAINE  Judy, hi, listen... JUDY  You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!  ELAINE  Oh I didn't tell anyone. JUDY  Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it. (shuts the door)  ELAINE  ... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)   (Jerry's apartment)  (Jerry and Jean-Paul come in) JERRY  Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.  JEAN-PAUL  It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)  JERRY  Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal   right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket) JEAN-PAUL  Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!  JERRY  That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)   (Kramer checks the water temperature and then opens the door)  JERRY  (shouting) Man that thing is noisy!  KRAMER  (shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!  JERRY  Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call.  KRAMER  Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the \"pop!\" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)   (street at night- Elaine walking and thinking, very worried)   (the following voices are on Elaine's mind) JERRY  He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.  JEAN-PAUL  I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.  JERRY  Frankly, I'm a little concerned. ELAINE  Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so   strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard   child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet)   ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I   took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in   the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!  (Jerry's apartment) 02 AM. Jean-Paul's sleeping at the sofa)   (Kramer's apartment) 02 AM. Kramer snores. The heat pump short circuits and blows the fuses on the entire building)   (Jerry's apartment) 02) JERRY  4:02? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!   (gets out of bedroom, in panic) Jean-Paul! The electricity went out! Wake up! Wake up!  WE GOTTA GO! IT'S 8  47! JEAN-PAUL  8:47!? (jumps out of the sofa)  (both running around, getting ready to go) JERRY  Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!  JEAN-PAUL  Idiot! I trusted you!  (Kramer comes in wrapped up in a blanket) JERRY  Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!  KRAMER  Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!  JERRY  What happened to your mental alarm?!  KRAMER  I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)   (New York marathon)  (Jerry and Jean-Paul try to get to the starting line through a crowd)  JERRY  Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way!   Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them) GUARD  Hey, hold it! JEAN-PAUL  I'm late, man, I'm in the race! GUARD  Go ahead. JEAN-PAUL  Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!  JERRY  All right, go, it's a race! Come on!   (George Steinbrenner's office at the Yankee Stadium)  (George comes in) GEORGE  You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?  STEINBRENNER  Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the   pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit. GEORGE  Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...  STEINBRENNER  Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating   personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening   to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax.   (New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer)  (They're waiting for the runners to run by. Kramer remains \"fully\" dressed and is carrying a   thermos with tea). JERRY  I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!  ELAINE  Then how did she find out, Jerry?!  JERRY  Maybe you should check with the rabbi.  KRAMER  (to Elaine) You want some hot tea?  ELAINE  Oh no, thank you. KRAMER  Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!   (The first runner to appear is Jean-Paul) ELAINE  There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)  KRAMER  Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)  JERRY  Come on, let's go Jean-Paul! ELAINE  Go Jean-Paaaaaul!  (We switch over to Jean-Paul. We hear him breathing. We hear his heart beating. Some people offer   him drinks. Jean-Paul grabs one, Kramer's hot tea, and leaves scene. Kramer gets very surprised.   We then hear Jean-Paul screaming in pain, and it's not hard to guess why. Kramer puts on a   \"whatta hell\" look, Elaine puts on an \"ouch\" look and Jerry puts on his \"it's a shame\" one.)   (George and Mr.Steinbrenner inside a hot tub) STEINBRENNER  How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?  GEORGE  (bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...  STEINBRENNER  I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. (laughs) She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. (George starts sliding, until he gets all his head -and glasses- under water, as Steinbrenner keeps talking) A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.  THE END>",

JERRY  Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?  SHEILA  You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.  JERRY  You're a shmoopy! SHEILA  You're a shmoopy! JERRY  You're a shmoopy! GEORGE  All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.  JERRY  Uh..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?  SHEILA  No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.  GEORGE  Hey. ELAINE  Hey. SHEILA  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  Hi Sheila. JERRY  All right, then. I'll see you later.  SHEILA  Bye shmoopy. JERRY  Bye shmoopy. ELAINE  Okay. We ready to go? GEORGE  Yes. Please. Please, let's go. ELAINE  Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.  JERRY  No. We gotta go to the soup place.  ELAINE  What soup place? GEORGE  Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.  JERRY  He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.  ELAINE  Stunned by soup? JERRY  You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.  ELAINE  Huh. All right. Come on. JERRY  There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.  ELAINE  Why? What happens if you don't order right?  JERRY  He yells and you don't get your soup.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.  GEORGE  All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.  JERRY  All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.  ELAINE  What? JERRY  The main thing is to keep the line moving.  GEORGE  All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.  JERRY  Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.  ELAINE  Oh, boy, I'm really scared! JERRY  Elaine. ELAINE  All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.  JERRY  Ar-moire. ELAINE  How much is this? FURNITURE GUY  I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.  ELAINE  Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.  JERRY  He gave you the nice face discount.  ELAINE  Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.  JERRY  What about the soup? ELAINE  I'm getting an armoire, Jerry. JERRY  (in French accent) Pardon. GEORGE  This line is huge. JERRY  It's like this all the time. GEORGE  Isn't that that Bania guy? JERRY  Oh, no. It is. Just be still. GEORGE  Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.  BANIA  Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.  JERRY  Hard to believe. BANIA  This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.  JERRY  Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.  BANIA  Why not? JERRY  Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.  BANIA  Okay. Okay. GEORGE  Medium turkey chili. JERRY  Medium crab bisque. GEORGE  I didn't get any bread. JERRY  Just forget it. Let it go. GEORGE  Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.  SOUP NAZI  Bread -- $2 extra. GEORGE  $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.  SOUP NAZI  You want bread? GEORGE  Yes, please. SOUP NAZI  $3! GEORGE  What? SOUP NAZI  No soup for you! (snaps fingers)  (cashier takes George's soup and gives him back his money) ELAINE  What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.  SUPER  It's Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule.  ELAINE  But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.  SUPER  Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a hand, all right?  ELAINE  Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.  FURNITURE GUY  I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.  ELAINE  Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.  JERRY  Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?  GEORGE  You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?  JERRY  I gave you a taste. What do you want?  GEORGE  Why can't we share? JERRY  I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!  GEORGE  Do you hear yourself? JERRY  I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.  GEORGE  Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.  SHEILA  Hi. Hi shmoopy. JERRY  Hi shmoopy. SHEILA  No, you're a shmoopy! JERRY  You're a shmoopy! GEORGE  I'm going. JERRY  Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?  GEORGE  You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.  JERRY  Why? GEORGE  I just don't feel like it anymore.  JERRY  Just like that? GEORGE  Just like that. SHEILA  Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he? KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  (taking Jerry's couch cushion) Yeah.  JERRY  Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?  KRAMER  Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all   night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.  JERRY  Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.  KRAMER  Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!  ELAINE  Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.  KRAMER  Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.  ELAINE  Do you need anything? KRAMER  Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.  ELAINE  Mulligatawny? KRAMER  Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of   the great soup artisans  in the modern era. ELAINE  Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi? KRAMER  He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most   geniuses are. ELAINE  All right. I'll be back. KRAMER  Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.  ELAINE  Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it. KRAMER  No. No, Elaine! ELAINE  Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?  GEORGE  No. I didn't get it. ELAINE  Why? What happened? GEORGE  I made a mistake. ELAINE  (laughing) GEORGE  All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.  ELAINE  Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of   there with a bowl of soup. GEORGE  Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you   find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl? ELAINE  Oh, I know! It is awful! GEORGE  Why do they have to do that in front of people?  ELAINE  I don't know. GEORGE  What is that with the shmoopy? ELAINE  Ohh! GEORGE  The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!  ELAINE  Ohh! Stop it! I know. GEORGE  I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is   actually called shmoopy. ELAINE  Ugh! GEORGE  And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.  ELAINE  You know, we should say something.  GEORGE  You know, we absolutely should. ELAINE  I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff   that is? GEORGE  I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.  ELAINE  Yeah. GEORGE  I still haven't figured him out. ELAINE  No. Me neither. GEORGE  All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.  ELAINE  Oh, God! GEORGE  Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.  SOUP NAZI  You're pushing your luck little man.  GEORGE  Sorry. Thank you. ELAINE  Hi there. Um, uh -- (drumming on countertop) Oh! Oh! Oh! One   mulligatawny and, um....  what is that right there? Is that lima bean? SOUP NAZI  Yes. ELAINE  Never been a big fan. (coughing) Um..you know what? Has anyone ever   told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, \" Scent Of A Woman.\"   Who-ah! Who-ah! SOUP NAZI  Very good. Very good. ELAINE  Well, I -- SOUP NAZI  You know something? ELAINE  Hmmm? SOUP NAZI  No soup for you! ELAINE  What? SOUP NAZI  Come back one year! Next! RAY  Look at this. BOB  It's an antique. RAY  It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.  BOB  Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No.   Pick it up from the bottom over there. KRAMER  Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?  BOB  What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.  KRAMER  You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.  BOB  Look, you wanna get hurt? KRAMER  Huh? BOB  I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can   hurt you. Now, just back off. RAY  Bob. BOB  Just pick it up. KRAMER  What is this, huh? BOB  You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding?   We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay? ELAINE  I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna   call the states' attorney office. I really am. GEORGE  Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.  ELAINE  All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit   down. What happened? Where's my armoire? KRAMER  Well, b -- it was stolen. ELAINE  Wha--? KRAMER  These street toughs, they robbed me.  ELAINE  Street toughs took my armoire? KRAMER  Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've   seen the way they talked to me. ELAINE  I can't believe this! KRAMER  Well, where's the soup? ELAINE  Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.  KRAMER  Oh...yeah! JERRY  What are you gonna get? SHEILA  I'll decide at the last minute. JERRY  You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!   (Soup Nazi pounding on countertop) JERRY  Uh-oh. SOUP NAZI  Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in   my line! SHEILA  I can kiss anywhere I want to. SOUP NAZI  You just cost yourself a soup! SHEILA  How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?  JERRY  Do I know you? ELAINE  So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?  JERRY  It was a bisque. ELAINE  Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become   much more normal than you. JERRY  Really? ELAINE  Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married.   Your top priority is soup. JERRY  Have you tastes the soup? ELAINE  Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.  JERRY  See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with   Sheila than with the Soup Nazi. JERRY  Hey. KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Hey. KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  Oh, thanks. ELAINE  There he is. KRAMER  Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.  ELAINE  Yeah. I know. Me, too. JERRY  So, did these thieves want any money?  KRAMER  No. JERRY  They just wanted the armoire? KRAMER  Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.   (interom buzzes) JERRY  Yeah? GEORGE  Hup! Hup! JERRY  Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?  ELAINE  No. In what way? JERRY  I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or   something. ELAINE  I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.  GEORGE  Hello. JERRY  Hello. KRAMER  Hey. GEORGE  Hello. ELAINE  Hello. GEORGE  Were you just talking about me? What's going on?  JERRY  Absolutely not. GEORGE  Something's going on here. KRAMER  All right, (claps hands) I'm gonna go get some soup.  ELAINE  One of these days that guy is gonna get his.  GEORGE  So, how was the movie? JERRY  Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.  GEORGE  Oh, yeah? JERRY  Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?  GEORGE  Happy? Why should I be happy? JERRY  I don't know, but you look like you're happy.  GEORGE  Why should I care? JERRY  You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when   you're happy. GEORGE  All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of   you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?   (Elaine sneaks out of Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Is that so? GEORGE  Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy,   shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!  JERRY  Disgusting? GEORGE  People who do that should be arrested.  JERRY  Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.  GEORGE  Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.  JERRY  What? GEORGE  You shook my hand in that coffee shop.  JERRY  You're still with the pact? GEORGE  Mmm-hmm. You reneged. JERRY  All I did was shake your hand. GEORGE  Ah-ha! KRAMER  And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.  SOUP NAZI  Ohh! This city. NEWMAN  One large jambalaya, please. SOUP NAZI  So, continue. KRAMER  Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very   emotional. NEWMAN  Thank you. (inhaling deeply) Jambalaya!  SOUP NAZI  All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have   an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome   to it. So, take it, it's yours. KRAMER  How can I possibly thank you? SOUP NAZI  You are the only one who understands me.  KRAMER  You suffer for your soup. SOUP NAZI  Yes. That is right. KRAMER  You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.  SOUP NAZI  How can I tolerate any less from my customer?  CUSTOMER  Uh, gazpacho, por favor. SOUP NAZI  Por favor? CUSTOMER  Um, I'm part Spanish. SOUP NAZI  Adios muchacho! KRAMER  Git. JERRY  It was stupid of me. SHEILA  Well, it was very insulting. JERRY  No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.  SHEILA  Well, behind every joke there's some truth.  JERRY  What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth   to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States   to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get   there and they don't have it he says \" Aw, I'll just have some   coffee.\" There's no truth to that. SHEILA  Well, I guess you're right. JERRY  So, am I forgiven, shmoopy? SHEILA  Yes, shmoopy. JERRY  Aw! SUSAN  Hey, Jerry! JERRY  Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.  GEORGE  Oh, yes. Hello. SHEILA  Hello. Won't you join us? GEORGE  No, thanks. SUSAN  Of course. GEORGE  Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?  JERRY  Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?  GEORGE  I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one   side...and leave the other side empty. JERRY  Well, we're changing the rules. GEORGE  Ahh. Good for you. SUSAN  Aw, what are you getting George? GEORGE  I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? (in babying voice) I   want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I   want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie? SUSAN  Oh, George, you're so sweet. GEORGE  Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.  SUSAN  Aww! JERRY  What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little   tuna fishy? SHEILA  Yeah. JERRY  Yum yum little tuna fishy? GEORGE  Come here.  (George &amp; Susan begin making out; Jerry &amp; Sheila begin making out in order   to keep up) KRAMER  And..voila! ELAINE  (gasps) KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!  KRAMER  Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?  ELAINE  The K Man did it! KRAMER  Yeah! ELAINE  (laughing) How much did you pay for this thing?  KRAMER  How 'bout zero? ELAINE  What? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?  KRAMER  I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously   refer to as the Soup Nazi. ELAINE  Get out!  (Elaine pushes on Kramer's chest, causing in to fall backwards through her   swinging door) ELAINE  The Soup Nazi gave it to you? KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Why? KRAMER  Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha --   Yeah. He's a wonderful man. ELAINE  (gasps) KRAMER  Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....  ELAINE  Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I   mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful! KRAMER  Yeah. Well, he's a dear. GEORGE  How much tip do you leave on $8.15?  SUSAN  You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you   today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all.   Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step   forward in our relationship. GEORGE  Huh? SUSAN  (in babying voice) Because you love your little kiki don't you?  CUSTOMER  How is he today? BANIA  I think he's in a good mood. ELAINE  Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful.   I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it. SOUP NAZI  You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to   him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it   to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up! JERRY  I'm heading over to Elaine's. KRAMER  Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.  JERRY  Those two? KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  Are you sure? KRAMER  Yeah. That's them. JERRY  Well, let's confront 'em. KRAMER  No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop. JERRY  There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.  KRAMER  No! JERRY  Let's go. BOB  Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.  RAY  Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.  BOB  Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't   think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.  KRAMER  Excuse me. RAY  Are you talking to me? KRAMER  Uh, well, uh, we -- RAY  I said, are you talking to me? BOB  Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you   was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you   talking to?! KRAMER  Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each   other, weren't we?  (Jerry &amp; Kramer turn around and run away) ELAINE  I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life.   There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi.   What? What is that? JERRY  I don't know. \" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of   olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley...\" ELAINE  Let me see this. (gasps) You know what this is? This is a recipe   for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes.   These are his recipes! JERY  So? ELAINE  So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to   every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could   drop fliers from a plane above the city. JERRY  Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?  ELAINE  What do you care? JERRY  Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup   stand. I happen to love that soup. ELAINE  Get out of my way, Jerry. JERRY  Elaine, let the man make his soup!  ELAINE  Don't make me hurt you, Jerry. SUSAN  Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby   bluey? GEORGE  Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey. JERRY  Well. Well. SUSAN  Hi, Jerry. JERRY  Hey, Susan, George. SUSAN  You know, I really like Sheila a lot.  JERRY  Oh, really? SUSAN  Mmm-hmm. JERRY  Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.  SUSAN  Oh, no! That's too bad. JERRY  Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.  GEORGE  Really? JERRY  Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.  SUSAN  Mmm-hmm. GEORGE  You did? JERRY  Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.  GEORGE  Yeah. See ya. SOUP NAZI  Go on! Leave! Get out! WOMAN  But I didn't do anything. SOUP NAZI  Next! ELAINE  Hello. SOUP NAZI  You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.  ELAINE  I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. \" 5 cups chopped Porcine   mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery.\" SOUP NAZI  That is my recipe for wild mushroom.  ELAINE  Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.  SOUP NAZI  Mulliga...tawny? ELAINE  You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!  NEWMAN  (panting) Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! JERRY  What is it? NEWMAN  Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!  JERRY  Wha - wha - what's the matter? NEWMAN  Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more soup for any of us!  JERRY  Well, where are you going? NEWMAN  He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!  THE END>",

        "text": "   THE SECRET CODE Written by        Alec Berg &amp; Jeff Schaffer   (Comedy club) JERRY  They really got us trained to use that cash machine now, don't they? We're just like chickens in an experiment waiting for that pellet to come down the chute. You see people at the cash machine; they're just there. Just, dit dit dit dit dit dit dit, they're waiting for the sound, you know the sound, you're waiting for the sound. That's what we're trained to hear, the 'here comes the money' sound, ya know? Flip flip flip flip flip flip flip. It's exciting, don't you get excited? It's coming! It's coming! They're giving me money!   (George and Susan are in George's apartment) SUSAN  Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.  GEORGE  Yeah, I better grab some too. SUSAN  I'll get it for you; just give me your card.  GEORGE  You sure? SUSAN  Yeah, just tell me your code. GEORGE  My code?  (Jerry and George are at the coffee shop) JERRY  So why didn't you tell her the code?  GEORGE  No. No way. JERRY  George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.  GEORGE  It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'  JERRY  So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?  GEORGE  Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?  JERRY  Actually, that's the definition of selfish.  GEORGE  Have you ever given your code to anyone?  JERRY  No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'  GEORGE  Superman's father on Krypton. JERRY  Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.  GEORGE  No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.  JERRY  What if my life depended on it? GEORGE  If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.   Jerry stands up and begins limping. GEORGE  What's the matter with your leg? JERRY  My foot fell asleep. GEORGE  How'd your foot fall asleep? JERRY  I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.   A friend of George and Jerry's walks up to the table. FRED  Hey Jerry. JERRY  Hey Fred. GEORGE  Hey Fred. JERRY  My foot fell asleep. FRED  You're lucky, at least you got something to do.   Elaine walks in. JERRY  Fred, do you know Elaine? FRED  No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys.  GEORGE  Alright, bye. JERRY  Seeya. ELAINE  Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'  JERRY  So? ELAINE  So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten   minutes. JERRY  And he didn't remember you?  Elaine gets up to leave. JERRY  Where are you going, you just got here?  ELAINE  I gotta go talk to him.  Elaine catches up to Fred on the street. ELAINE  Excuse me, excuse me, Fred? FRED  Yeah? ELAINE  You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.  FRED  We have? ELAINE  Yeah, at Katie Ash's party? FRED  What was your name again? ELAINE  Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my   uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?  FRED  Not ringing a bell. ELAINE  When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at   him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'? FRED  Mmm, no. ELAINE  That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.  FRED  The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and   the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.   Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone. JERRY  Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should   really be fun.  Kramer enters holding a police scanner. JERRY  Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do   some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry   himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow. KRAMER  Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.  JERRY  What is that? KRAMER  Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything: Fires,   harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we   got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up   to be a fireman. JERRY  Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.  KRAMER  When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that   big hook and ladder. JERRY  You're lucky they let you drive a car.  KRAMER  No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day   that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.   Kramer runs out, Elaine enters. ELAINE  What was that? JERRY  (waving his arm in dismissal) Eh. ELAINE  Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers   every little thing about that night except me. JERRY  Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.  ELAINE  What are you saying? JERRY  Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.  ELAINE  Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know. JERRY  I know. ELAINE  Ya know? JERRY  Yeah, I know. ELAINE  Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.  JERRY  Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.  ELAINE  Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to   dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me. JERRY  Why would I wanna do that? ELAINE  Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells   these stories, it's gonna be awful. JERRY  Yeah, sounds like fun.  George and Susan are at George's apartment. SUSAN  I want you to tell me, George. GEORGE  Why? Why is my code so important? SUSAN  Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust.   We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another. GEORGE  Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about   your cycles. SUSAN  My cycles? GEORGE  Yeah, I never know what's going on there.  SUSAN  Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.  GEORGE  Please. SUSAN  Anything else? GEORGE  We're out of Bosco!  Jerry and Leapin' Larry are in the office at the appliance store.  JERRY  Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our   prices, we'll give you the store. LEAPIN' LARRY  Ya know I've always liked your comedy, you don't take cheap   shots. JERRY  No I don't. LEAPIN' LARRY  Sorry for keeping you here so long. Again, I apologize for the   mess. This renovation is killing me. JERRY  My foot's asleep again!  Leapin' Larry walks out from behind his desk, he has a severe limp,  LEAPIN' LARRY  When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed   about this damn prosthetic I thought I was gonna have to give up the business.   But now I'm rejuvenated. Let me show you around the store. JERRY  You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.   Jerry stands and begins to 'walk off' his sleeping foot. A Leapin' Larry's   employee begins laughing. EMPLOYEE  That is a great impression!  Leapin' Larry walks in, sees Jerry, and is obviously disappointed. Jerry is   embarrassed. JERRY  Larry, wait, you don't understand!   Jerry and Kramer are in Jerry's apartment. KRAMER  I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is   that what you've sunk to? JERRY  I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.  KRAMER  Oh, oh your foot fell asleep. JERRY  Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry,   you'd think he had a sense of humor about it. KRAMER  Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you,   munjamba?  Jerry's door buzzer rings, Jerry presses the button. JERRY  Yup. VOICE  Hup.  A news bulletin is shown on the TV. KRAMER  Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.  JERRY  Wow, the whole building burned down.  KRAMER  They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got   us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes? JERRY  Of course. KRAMER  It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.  JERRY  The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.   Kramer leaves, George enters. GEORGE  Where we gonna eat? JERRY  We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.  GEORGE  Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.  JERRY  Of course not, if I did would you have gone?  GEORGE  No way. JERRY  There you go. GEORGE  I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna   have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be   off. JERRY  Trust me, you're off.  Elaine bumps into Fred on the street. ELAINE  Oh, hi Fred. FRED  Um, hello? ELAINE  It's Elaine. FRED  Oh yeah, yeah, right. ELAINE  How ya doin'? FRED  I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the   button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it. ELAINE  Yeah, that's too bad. FRED  Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted.  ELAINE  Hmm. I never take them. FRED  Cause they make you nauseous, right?  ELAINE  Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!  FRED  Do you wanna have dinner tonight? ELAINE  Hmm. Tonight. FRED  What, you have other plans? ELAINE  No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.   Jerry and George enter a Chinese restaurant, we pick them up in   mid-conversation. JERRY  ...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet.   The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your   ATM code. GEORGE  Call the Embassy. JERRY  They're closed. GEORGE  Why? JERRY  Bomb threat. GEORGE  We're in Turkey? JERRY  Midnight Express, my friend. GEORGE  My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.   Mr. Peterman walks in. PETERMAN  You must be Jerry Seinfeld. JERRY  Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.  PETERMAN  J. Peterman. GEORGE  J. Crew. JERRY  Well, is Elaine here? PETERMAN  Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll   tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls. GEORGE  What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?  JERRY  Without Elaine? What for? GEORGE  What, is he crazy? JERRY  We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.  GEORGE  I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.  JERRY  George, what's the matter with you?  GEORGE  I'm choking! PETERMAN  Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?  JERRY  Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that   I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry. PETERMAN  I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company.   Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.  Elaine is waiting on the street. ELAINE  I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?   George and Peterman are eating dinner. Peterman is in mid-story. George is   disinterested. PETERMAN  ...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my   search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit   sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half   through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.  GEORGE  Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?   Jerry's apartment, Jerry has his feet up and a big bowl of popcorn beside him on   the couch. TV ANNOUNCER  It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You   gotta love sports!  Peterman is driving George home. GEORGE  You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.  PETERMAN  Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you   about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.   The car phone rings, Peterman answers. PETERMAN  Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To   George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make   it there in time.  Peterman makes a quick u-turn, pushing George's face into the passenger side   window.  Elaine is on the phone with Jerry. JERRY  I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.  ELAINE  Well, Fred asked me out. JERRY  Fred? ELAINE  Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.  JERRY  You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't   remember anything about you. ELAINE  I am? But that's so sick. JERRY  That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.  ELAINE  Anyway, so how was the dinner? JERRY  Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the   hell out of there. ELAINE  What about Georgie? JERRY  Nah, he didn't make it.  Peterman's mother's house. She's in bed; Peterman is consulting with the   doctor. PETERMAN  Doctor, how is she? DOCTOR  She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.  PETERMAN  Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.   She looks off in George's direction. GEORGE  I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.   Peterman's mother's apartment. George is sleeping in a chair with a coat   covering him. Peterman wakes him up. PETERMAN  Shake off the dew, my friend. GEORGE  Yeah. What time is it? PETERMAN  It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us   a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you? GEORGE  Who? PETERMAN  Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it   helps.  Peterman leaves, George attempts conversation. GEORGE  Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fiancé, you know, we, uh,   we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my   secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I   would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna   know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that   stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a   relief! MRS. PETERMAN  Bosco. Bosco. GEORGE  Oh, shhh. MRS. PETERMAN  Bosco! PETERMAN  Momma?  George\" Quiet, quiet! It's a secret. MRS. PETERMAN  Bosco! Bosco! Bosco! GEORGE  Shut up! Shut up!  Peterman runs in. PETERMAN  Momma! What are you trying to say?  MRS. PETERMAN  Bosco.  Mrs. Peterman falls back in bed and closes her eyes. PETERMAN  She's gone. Bosco?  Peterman looks at George, who shrugs.  George and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment. GEORGE  You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't   bailed out on me at the restaurant. JERRY  I did not bail out on you. GEORGE  Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?  JERRY  Why didn't you come up with your own?  GEORGE  I froze. I think I'm losing it. JERRY  Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?  GEORGE  No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.   Kramer enters. GEORGE  Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.  JERRY  Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?  GEORGE  I am not giving you my code. KRAMER  I'll bet I can guess it. GEORGE  Pssh. Yeah. Right. KRAMER  Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out   birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a   word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well,   you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?  GEORGE  Huh? KRAMER  You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your   pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet   tooth. GEORGE  Get out of here. KRAMER  Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the   cocoa bean. GEORGE  I'm leaving. KRAMER  No, and only the  purest syrup nectar can satisfy you! GEORGE  I gotta go. KRAMER  If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!  GEORGE  Shut up! KRAMER  Nestlé's Quik! GEORGE  Shut up!  Elaine and George are at the funeral. GEORGE  What was that? ELAINE  What? GEORGE  You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?  ELAINE  I got a date.  Mr. Peterman walks up. ELAINE  Oh, Mr. Peterman. PETERMAN  Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been   trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.  GEORGE  Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy   person. ELAINE  Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've   gotta get going. PETERMAN  You do? GEORGE  Uh, yes, actually we-we both do. ELAINE  I have a personal commitment. GEORGE  Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...  PETERMAN  What is it? ELAINE  I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.  GEORGE  Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.  PETERMAN  I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you   to stop by. ELAINE  My pleasure. PETERMAN  Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.   Elaine leaves. PETERMAN  You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor   that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.   Kramer busts in to Jerry's apartment, Jerry is putting on a jacket.  KRAMER  Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?  JERRY  Fire station? KRAMER  Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!  JERRY  Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.  KRAMER  Oh, so he took you back. JERRY  Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.  KRAMER  Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.  JERRY  No I didn't.  Kramer is at the fire station, talking with the Captain. CAPTAIN  Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive.  KRAMER  Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the   Village, then you're gonna see a magic show. CAPTAIN  Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like   yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for   the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are.   Jerry is back at Leapin' Larry's. JERRY  Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.  LEAPIN' LARRY  Water under the bridge. Come on, I never did get a chance to   show you around the store. JERRY  Oh sure.  Jerry stands up to find his leg is asleep. JERRY  Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.   Jerry stomps his foot on the floor a few times before he leaves, he accidentally   bumps a paint can which knocks over a can of flammable liquid which spills onto   some exposed electrical wires causing a fire.  Back at the fire station, the alarm is ringing. DISPATCHER  Attention Company 390, structure fire at Leapin' Larry's Appliance   Warehouse. KRAMER  Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.  CAPTAIN  Stay out of this, Kramer.  Kramer sees the firemen slide down the pole and he gives it a try. As he lands   he bumps one of the firemen into the truck, then to the floor in a daze.  KRAMER  Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?  FIREMAN  I drive the back of the truck.  Kramer's face lights up. KRAMER  Well, you'd better take it easy.  Kramer grabs a coat and helmet and heads towards the back of the truck.   Elaine and Fred are having dinner. FRED  Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her   pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were   right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?  ELAINE  Huh. FRED  The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's   no transportation... ELAINE  What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he   didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him... FRED  ...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab,   she'd start yelling at me, \"Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so   expensive!\" She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her.   George and Peterman are sitting beside the casket. PETERMAN  Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.  There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames!   Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is   still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head.  PETERMAN  George!  Inside the speeding fire engine. CAPTAIN  Gonna make a left onto Broadway. KRAMER  No, I would advise against that. CAPTAIN  Who is this?  Quick cut to Kramer driving the back of the fire truck. KRAMER  It's Kramer! CAPTAIN  Kramer?! What the hell are you doing back there?  KRAMER  DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose.   Outside Leapin' Larry's. Jerry is helping bring out appliances as smoke pours   from the building. A woman approaches Jerry. WOMAN  How did this start? JERRY  Beats me. LEAPIN' LARRY  Where the hell's the fire department? I'm gonna lose the whole   store!  Cut back to Kramer on the truck. CAPTAIN  Kramer, get the hell off of there. You're not trained to operate this   equipment! MAN ON THE STREET  Hey, Kramer! KRAMER  Hey!  Cut back to Leapin' Larry's. LEAPIN' LARRY  Try the scanner, see if you can pick up anything.   Jerry turns on the scanner. CAPTAIN  What are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!  KRAMER  Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!  JERRY  Kramer?  Cut to Kramer losing control of the truck. CAPTAIN  You're losing control! Hard right! Hard right!   Cut to Jerry holding the scanner. he hears screaming, a crashing sound, and   then static. JERRY  Ah, that's a shame.  George and Peterman lead a group of people down a smoke filled block.  PETERMAN  The fire will eat up this entire block!   They come upon an ATM vestibule. PETERMAN  Look, there's a man in there. Get out of there, you're in danger!  MAN  But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!  PETERMAN  George, give me your ATM card! GEORGE  I don't have my ATM card. PETERMAN  George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!   George pulls out his wallet, Peterman grabs the card, fits it into the slot and   tries the door. PETERMAN  It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,   The man grabs the card and slams it into the machine. MAN  Now give me your code! GEORGE  What?! Why? MAN  The machine won't open without the code!  PETERMAN  George, give him your code! GEORGE  But I-I-I- PETERMAN  George, there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code,   man!! MAN  The code!! The code!!  George and Jerry are watching TV at George's, Susan walks in and drops some mail   on the coffee table. SUSAN  Hi. Here's your cash, George. GEORGE  Hm. Thanks. SUSAN  And here's your card back. Anyone for Bosco?  JERRY  Oh my god. Look at this. GEORGE  Hm? PERRY  It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.   (Jerry hands the catalog to George.) GEORGE  The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother. THE END>",

        "text": "    THE POOL GUY Written by   David Mandel   (Jerry's apartment) GEORGE  Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?  JERRY  Well, what do you mean? GEORGE  Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?  JERRY  Well I think that's pretty obvious.  GEORGE  Yeah. Me too.  (Elaine enters carrying a cup of coffee) JERRY  Hey Elaine. ELAINE  Hey. JERRY  Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here (pointing up and down at George)  ELAINE  You mean in a real Fight Fight? JERRY  Mona a Baldo. ELAINE  George. GEORGE  Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)  JERRY  Why? ELAINE  George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)  JERRY  Really? What would you do? GEORGE  Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)  JERRY  Hmm. ELAINE  So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.  JERRY  I'm sorry. ELAINE  George? GEORGE  Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?  ELAINE  There's nobody I can go with.  (Kramer enters) ELAINE  You know what. I don't have one female friend left.  KRAMER  Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.  ELAINE  Thank you. KRAMER  So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?  JERRY  Ah, how about 8:30? KRAMER  Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)  JERRY  You want to get something to eat first?  KRAMER  ( mumbling with full mouth ) No, I'm good.  GEORGE  I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)  KRAMER  There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, who's afraid of a woman. (voice get high-pitched for the last line)  JERRY  Hey, why don't cha ask Susan? ELAINE  George's Susan? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, I'll see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)  KRAMER  That's gunna be trouble. JERRY  Why? KRAMER  Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?   (Kramer raises his hands into the air and slowly brings them together in an explosion. He's holding some food in one hand, so when his hands come into contact food flies all over)  KRAMER  Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound)   Camera fades from the apt. to the Paragon Movie Theater. Jerry and Kramer wait outside in a line to buy tickets.  KRAMER  Did I tell you I'm getting a new telephone number?  JERRY  How come? KRAMER  Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.   (Jerry looks at Kramer, raises his eyebrows with an expression that says really?)  RAMON  (recognizes Jerry) Hey Jerry. How are you Mr. Backstroke?  JERRY  Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.  KRAMER  Oh, yeah. RAMON  So you know what happened don't chu?  JERRY  No what? RAMON  I got fired. JERRY  Really? RAMON  Yeah, said I put too much chlorine in the pool.  JERRY  Ahh. RAMON  Hey well, ah, stay out of the deep end, eh.  JERRY  OK, see you later. KRAMER  What's in the deep end?  Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside. Susan sits on the couch reading.   (Telephone rings) GEORGE  Hello? ELAINE  Hey George. GEORGE  Hey Elainie. What's going on? ELAINE  (sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan  GEORGE  Ha, Yeah right, hang on, I'll ah, I'll get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up? ELAINE  No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?  GEORGE  Susan, why? ELAINE  Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.  GEORGE  Oh, I don't think you want to do that.  ELAINE  Why not? GEORGE  Well what would be the point of that?   (Susan, hearing her name glances over at George) ELAINE  George, are you going to put her on the phone?  GEORGE  Where did this come from all of a sudden?  ELAINE  George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?  GEORGE  I really think I should have been consulted about this.   (George takes the phone from his ear and walks over to the couch and hands the phone to Susan) GEORGE  Here ... something. SUSAN  Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.  (George stands behind the couch, arms crossed with his right hand clenched up to his mouth. He takes off his glasses, puts his left hand just above his eyes and rubs them in disbelief and walks out of the room.)  Night exterior of a busy NYC street. Large lit advertising signs for Panasonic, JVC and a couple of McDonalds Golden Arches are visible. Then to the inside of the movie theater. KRAMER  You want to sit here? JERRY  Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over) KRAMER  Why? JERRY  Little buffer zone. KRAMER  (Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)  JERRY  Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other? KRAMER  No. You got a point. JERRY  All right. KRAMER  I can't ... JERRY  What are you doing? KRAMER  Well these seats have no lumbar. JERRY  Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.   (Ramon is looking for a seat. He's carrying a drink, a bunch of napkins, and a huge bucket of popcorn) KRAMER  We are talking. JERRY  Pretend it's interesting. KRAMER  So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me. JERRY  Oh yeah that's shocking, but sounds ...  RAMON  Hey, hi Jerry. JERRY  Oh, hey Ramon. RAMON  Hey, hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some?  JERRY  Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)  RAMON  Hey, ahhh, is this seat taken?  (Ramon proceeds to sit down between Kramer and Jerry) JERRY  No.  (As Ramon sits down, he bumps into Kramer and startles him. Jerry looks like he can't believe Ramon sat down. Ramon is bobbing his head front to back with his neck, like sitting there worked out pretty good)   Exterior of Jerry's apartment building then inside where Jerry and George are talking. JERRY  And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now. GEORGE  By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?  JERRY  No why? GEORGE  (sighs) She called Susan last night.  JERRY  Oh yeah, I know. GEORGE  How do you know? JERRY  Well it was my idea. GEORGE  Your idea? JERRY  Yeah. GEORGE  Wha'd you do that for? JERRY  She was looking for someone to go to the show with.  GEORGE  Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now? JERRY  World's collide. (points at George)  GEORGE  Whe ... Well yeah! JERRY  Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with -- GEORGE  YES! It Blows Up! So if you know that, what did you tell Elaine for? JERRY  I didn't know. Kramer told me about the worlds.  GEORGE  You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart.   (gesturing with hands going outward) JERRY  Yeah, I guess I slipped up.  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Hey. GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  Hey. GEORGE  He knows the worlds theory. KRAMER  What is it blowing up? GEORGE  Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)   (Telephone rings - Kramer pulls a cordless phone from his pocket)  KRAMER  Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes. JERRY  What is it? KRAMER  Well it's 555-3455. JERRY  555-3455. KRAMER  Yeah. JERRY  (picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK. KRAMER  What's Filk? JERRY  Filk's nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.  KRAMER  Oh Movie Phone. JERRY  Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.  KRAMER  So, I'm Filk? JERRY  You're Filk. KRAMER  Oh, Mama.  Susan and Elaine are walking down the sidewalk. ELAINE  Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye. SUSAN  Oh whoo. Quite the DèColletage for a suffragette.  ELAINE  Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.  SUSAN  Whoo. ELAINE  Ha, ha, ha, ha. SUSAN  Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.  ELAINE  What? SUSAN  Ehahh, forget it. ELAINE  What? You can tell me. I'll put it in the vault.  SUSAN  The vault? ELAINE  Mm-Hmm.  Exterior shot of Physique (Jerry's health club) then inside to the men's locker room where Jerry is putting some clothes in a gym bag. Some men are in the background talking.  the movies with Ramon. JERRY  Oh, well, I didn't actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)  you to cheer him up. PAUL  Tell him to call us. DUSTIN  Tell him, Dustin says, Hello. JERRY  All right, I gotta go. PAUL  To see Ramon?  (Paul, with his eyes wide open looking at Jerry. Dustin stares off the other direction, laughing to himself)  Exterior of Jerry's apartment building, then inside Jerry's apartment.  JERRY  What else did you two do? ELAINE  Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.  JERRY  Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?   (Elaine stands there for a good 6 seconds with arms crossed, blank expression, just looking at Jerry) ELAINE  That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?  JERRY  Yes, I do. (very serious) ELAINE  All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)  JERRY  Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship. ELAINE  Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)  (Kramer enters and leaves the door open) KRAMER  Hey man, what's going on? JERRY  Hey.  (Telephone rings) KRAMER  Ooh, here we go. (pulls a cordless phone from his pocket) Yeah hello. Yeah, no, no, no, hold on.  (Kramer walks over to the table, opens the newspaper to the movie   section) KRAMER  Yeah, Cupid's Rifle -- 8:30, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.  (Kramer hangs up the cordless and pushes the antenna back in, puts the phone in his pocket) JERRY  You're looking up movies for people now?  KRAMER  I got time.  (Telephone rings) KRAMER  And this. (pulls out the cordless phone from his pocket) Cosmo here. Yeah, un-huh, no, no, no, no, I'll help. Yeah, Firestorm's   good. I saw it yesterday. Yeah well my buddy Jerry , ah, he's seen it twice. You want to talk to him? Here -- (holds the phone out to Jerry)  JERRY  (shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.   (Jerry is backing away, as Kramer attempt to foist the phone on to Jerry, but he will not take it -- Kramer continues to try and get Jerry to take the phone from him)   CONTINUITY ERROR -- DURING THIS PART OF THE SCENE, WE CLEARLY SEE Kramer's right hand holding the phone, his left hand is empty. This sequence is shot from several camera angles. At the end of the   sequence, Kramer is holding the folded newspaper in his left hand -- he did not reach over to pick up the paper -- so this is obviously a CONTINUITY ERROR  KRAMER  Just, just tell him about the picture. What's the matter with you? Stop it. (puts the phone back to his ear) Yes, are you still   showing.  (Kramer walks out the open door and into his apt. with the newspaper.   Elaine walks back into the living room, wondering what just happened,   she gestures towards Kramer as he exits)  (Intercom buzzes) JERRY  Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?  RAMON  (Hey it's Ramon) JERRY  What? RAMON  (Hey, It's Ramon Jerry. I'm coming up)  JERRY  (to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?  ELAINE  Who? Who is Ramon? JERRY  He's the pool guy. ELAINE  What pool guy? JERRY  Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.  ELAINE  Yeah, no problem.  ---------------------------------------------------- INCONSISTENCY IN REALITY -- RAMON SHOWS UP AT JERRY'S DOOR, 8 SECONDS from the time when Jerry stops pressing the intercom buzzer. Either Ramon would have to run up 5 flights of stairs incredibly fast (he does not appear out of breath) or those are some very fast elevators.   -- and we know from a Episode 6 The Ex-Girlfriend that Elaine complains ABOUT THE SLOW ELEVATORS IN JERRY'S APT. BUILDING.   Episode 6 The Ex-Girlfriend ELAINE  You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.  JERRY  Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.  ---------------------------------------------------- RAMON  Hee hey, hey Jerry (claps hands and points both index fingers at him) How are you, crazy guy? JERRY  Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.  ELAINE  Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own) JERRY  So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?  RAMON  Well, I was in the neighborhood. I figured I'd check you out.  JERRY  Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.  RAMON  Oh, oh yeah. Wha? Where you going?  JERRY  Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder) RAMON  Hey that's cool. I'm up for some stuff  JERRY  All right.  (They head for the door)  Moving subway cars blur by, then inside the subway car where Jerry sits next to Ramon RAMON  So get this. I get down there, and right away, I see the drain is clogged. I mean it's obvious. Can you believe it? JERRY  All right Ramon, I'm going to get going.   (Subway train stops and door opens) JERRY  I think we should separate here actually.  RAMON  What are you trying to say Jerry? JERRY  Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more. RAMON  Oh I see. It's cause I clean pools, right?  JERRY  That has nothing to do with it. RAMON  You su -- (no audio) (through the moving subway window, Ramon is swearing and pointing at Jerry)  Exterior of George's apartment building then inside his apartment.  SUSAN  Yeah, we got along real well. GEORGE  You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman who's friends are all men.  SUSAN  Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.  GEORGE  You talked all about that? SUSAN  Oh yeah. Elaine opened up her vault.  GEORGE  Did you just say vault? SUSAN  Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong? GEORGE  You got that from Elaine. SUSAN  Yeah. So what? GEORGE  Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on? SUSAN  I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.  GEORGE  We'd all go to movie on Friday? SUSAN  Yeah. GEORGE  This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!  (Commercial)  Inside Jerry's apartment -- Jerry sits on the couch listening to George.  GEORGE  Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George. JERRY  I, I love that George. GEORGE  Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!  (Elaine enters) GEORGE  You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?  ELAINE  George I don't even want to get --  GEORGE  You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu, hu, hu. ELAINE  So? GEORGE  She got that from you! ELAINE  Well, I didn't tell here to say it.  GEORGE  What is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl? ELAINE  I Like Her! GEORGE  You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what I'm talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door) JERRY  So you want to catch a movie later?  ELAINE  Ahh, yeah, sure. JERRY  I don't have a paper though. ELAINE  Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)   (Ring) KRAMER  Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. Brought to you by the New York Times and Hot 97. Coming to theaters this Friday ... Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon -- You've got to get me over that mountain! Now (bang, bang) AHHHHHHHHHH There is no place higher than ... Mountain High. Rated R. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press 1. ELAINE  Kramer, is that you? KRAMER  Elaine? ELAINE  Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?  KRAMER  I don't know.  Exterior of the Physique health club, then inside to the men's locker room. RAMON  Well, well. Look who's here. JERRY  Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.  RAMON  No, I don't think so Jerry. You see they gave me my job back.  JERRY  What? RAMON  I'm a pool boy ... again. JERRY  Look Ramon, about the other day. I'm sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway. RAMON  Do you? JERRY  What happened to all the towels? RAMON  Oh, ah, I guess they must have disappeared. (walks away)   (Newman rushes up to Jerry) NEWMAN  Hey Jerry. Look at all the towels they gave me! I really hit the jackpot! (holding a large stack of towels, Newman pats his face with the top one) Ha, ha, ha.  (Jerry extends his arms, making a vain attempt at a reach for a towel as Newman walks away)  Exterior of Elaine's building. Elaine and Jerry walk down the steps and on to the sidewalk. JERRY  It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's   always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...  ELAINE  Uh-huh. JERRY  And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.  ELAINE  Uhh, so frustrating! JERRY  Tell me about it. ELAINE  Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop? JERRY  You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?  ELAINE  Yeah. JERRY  I'm meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.  ELAINE  Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.   (Elaine walks off, while Jerry stands there contemplating the upcoming ramifications)  Elaine and Jerry enter Monk's coffee shop as Susan sits across the booth from Kramer. SUSAN  Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here! KRAMER  There they are. SUSAN  Yeah, look who I ran into. KRAMER  Hey. ELAINE  Yeah. (sits down next to Susan) KRAMER  Yeah. ELAINE  Ahh.  (Jerry stands a few paces from the booth, looking around for George, and feeling uncomfortable about the upcoming events) KRAMER  Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?  JERRY  Ah, you know. I'm supposed to meet, eh, someone -- I'll, I'll wait for them outside. (walks towards the door) KRAMER  Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you? JERRY  This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)   (Jerry sits down next to Kramer) SUSAN  What's that Jerry? JERRY  (coughing) I said, boy am I ugly.  (George enters the coffee shop) SUSAN  Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.   (George walks in and stops, looking at the four of them sitting in the booth. He nods his head and extends his arm in acknowledgment, nods his head again, he lightly claps his hands and walks up to the table)  GEORGE  One, two ... three, four.  (extending his arm and counting to Elaine, Susan, Kramer and Jerry, who he puts his hand under Jerry's chin and then makes a fist and presses it to Jerry's cheek) GEORGE  Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)  SUSAN  Hey George! JERRY  We'll pull up another chair.  Exterior of Reggie's diner, then inside where George sits alone in a booth. He eats in silence. A man sits at the counter, sipping coffee.   Exterior shot of the Physique health club, then inside to the pool. Jerry is swimming while Ramon is cleaning the pool with a large squeegee on a long pole. JERRY  I see you there Ramon.  (Ramon jabs a little bit at Jerry with the squeegee) JERRY  Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. I'm not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because I'm a member here, this is my place to swim.  (Ramon pushes the squeegee out into Jerry's swim path -- Jerry grabs the squeegee pole and they struggle in a push-pull match) JERRY  Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.   (Ramon loses his balance and Jerry pulls him into the pool)  RAMON  Oh.  (Newman runs towards the pool in one of those old time bathing suits)  NEWMAN  Olly, olly, oxen, free!  (It looks like Newman tries to do a cannonball into the pool, filmed in slow motion. Ramon looks up with a stunned look on his face, seeing Newman as he jumps into the pool on top of him.) JERRY  (NO!)  Camera fade to Ramon, lying unconscious on the tile pool deck. Newman and Jerry are kneeling over him. JERRY  I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  NEWMAN  Mouth-to-mouth? JERRY  Yeah. NEWMAN  Huh. JERRY  Well? Go ahead. NEWMAN  You go. JERRY  You knocked him out. NEWMAN  Yeah, but you pulled him in. JERRY  Come on Newman. Do it. NEWMAN  Nah. JERRY  He might die. NEWMAN  Yeah. Maybe.  Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside where Susan and Elaine are sitting and talking. ELAINE  (on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater.  00, we can't wait any  longer. SUSAN  Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just disappear. ELAINE  Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?  SUSAN  Oh, I don't know. ELAINE  Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry.   Love? SUSAN  Yeah. ELAINE  Love ... Susan.  Camera fade to Elaine, Susan and Jerry outside the Paragon movie   theater. It's night as they wait in line to buy tickets. JERRY  So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth. ELAINE  He could have died JERRY  Yeah, it was a gamble. SUSAN  Why didn't you give him mouth-to-mouth?  JERRY  Ah. (makes face) ELAINE  How can you possibly show your face there again?  JERRY  Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.  (they move up to the ticket window) ELAINE  Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)  Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside where George finds the note. GEORGE  What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.  (Rings) KRAMER  Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one. GEORGE  Come on. Come on. KRAMER  Using your touch-tone keypad, please enter the first three letters of the movie title, now.  (George presses 3 keys) KRAMER  You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.  GEORGE  What? KRAMER  Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct, press one.  (George looks baffled) KRAMER  Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected. GEORGE  Chunnel? KRAMER  To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit zip-code, now.  (George enters his zip-code) KRAMER  Why don't you just tell me where you want to see the movie?  GEORGE  Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway. KRAMER  (picks up paper) Chunnel, is playing at the Paragon 84th Street  GEORGE  Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door) KRAMER  It's also playing in theater number two at 9:00.   Night exterior of United Artists Theater with a busy street in the foreground -- taxi's drive by. Then inside to a darkened theater,   George, in the isle, searches for Jerry, Elaine and Susan. He's trying to be quiet and still get their attention. GEORGE  Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan! MOVIE PATRON  SHH! The English Channel Tunnel,  Chunnel, runs 32.3 miles, with two openings. One here, in England and another one here, in France. That's all we got. Thank you for your time gentlemen. Can I ask you a question Mr. McKittrick.  -- it's a bit hard to hear the movie dialogue, as we are supposed to be focused on George, but I was able to make out most of it)  Cut to Susan, Elaine and Jerry watching Chunnel in the theater next door. Jerry is eating popcorn while Elaine sips a drink and eats a bit of popcorn JERRY  I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?  SUSAN  No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.   (Susan looks irritated at Jerry and Elaine's talking) JERRY  What is he doing in the Chunnel? SUSAN  Would you two, Please?  (movie voice - clearly it's Larry David's voice) ( Everybody out of the Chunnel! Everybody out! )  (Elaine and Jerry stop eating, sink back into their seats and look at each other, with silent expressions that say what is her problem.)  Let me tell you  something about the Chunnel, Mr. Thane. That our only freeway is adept. (inaudible) Elaine Brookstone will get the money bag   (inaudible) Not as long as I have these long stickers. Find him and Kill him! I don't care if we have to turn this Chunnel upside down! Find Him! Everybody out of the Chunnel! Everybody out! The Chunnel's   gonna blow! AHHHHHH (Explosion)   THIS TIME IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO MAKE ALL OF IT OUT, SO THERE ARE SOME inaudible parts, but I tried to pick up most of it)  back to George in the other theater. He stands at the front of the theater, the movie screen behind and above him. He is still trying to find Jerry, Elaine and Susan. GEORGE  Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!  MOVIE PATRON  (Hey, sit down!) GEORGE  Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!  MOVIE PATRON  (Hey, we're trying to watch a movie here!)  GEORGE  Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies! MOVIE PATRON  (Move it off of there!) GEORGE  Where are you! 2ND MOVIE PATRON  (Hey are you sure you got the right theater?)  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel. Susan! 2ND MOVIE PATRON  (It's playing in two theaters.) GEORGE  Two theaters? 2ND MOVIE PATRON  (Yeah, there's a 9:00 too.) GEORGE  Oh. Sorry.  (A large bucket of popcorn is thrown at George. He tries to deflect it, but the popcorn flies all over) There's something  else, your ex-wife. Alexandra? She's in France, I'm telling ya. No, she's in the Chunnel. The Chunnel? No! Mr. President, I'm sorry to disturb you. What is it? There's something about the Chunnel. Oh? (inaudible) And that means your daughter is in the Chunnel. Somewhere   between France and ... (inaudible)   AGAIN, IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO MAKE ALL OF IT OUT, SO THERE ARE SOME inaudible parts, but I tried to pick up most of it)  Elaine, Susan and Jerry exit the theater. ELAINE  I thought that was pretty good, huh?  JERRY  Wha'd you think Susan? SUSAN  Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie. ELAINE  Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?  JERRY  Yeah. SUSAN  Ah, no. I don't think so. ELAINE  Why not? SUSAN  Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know how you can stand it. I'll see you.  (Susan turns to walk away, but stops and looks at George being escorted out of the theater by two ushers. He struggles to try and stay inside the theater, but they forcefully remove him. Jerry, Elaine and Susan watch as George it escorted out -- he does not see the three of them standing there.) GEORGE  I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying. USHER  Let's go pal. GEORGE  They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!  (Camera freeze on George with the two ushers -- and into commercial)  his hand knocks 3 times on the door. MOVIE PHONE GUY  Hello, and welcome to your worst nightmare.   (Kramer, sitting on the couch, reading the paper and eating cereal is obviously startled by the voice at his door) MOVIE PHONE GUY  (con't) I know your in there, Cosmo Kramer, Apartment 5B. You're in big trouble, Now. You've been sealing my business. If you'd like to do this the easy way, open the door, Now. Or, please  select the number of seconds, you'd like to wait, before I break this door down. Please select Now.  (as the Movie Phone Guy talks, Kramer slides off the couch and ducks down under the coffee table, then pops back up with a dazed look.)     THE END>",

        "text": "  THE SPONGE Written by  Peter Mehlman   (Comedy club) JERRY  I have a friend, wears eyeglasses, no prescription in the glasses because he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, now why? Why do we think that glasses makes us look more intelligent? Is it from the endless hours of reading and studying and researching that this person supposedly blew out their eyeballs, and that's why they need the glasses? It's just a corrective device. If you see someone with a hearing aid, you don't think, 'Oh, they must have been listening real good...yeah, to a lot of important stuff...' No, they are deaf. They can't hear.   (Jerry and Elaine in a booth at Monk's. Kramer comes over from the counter with a clipboard in his hand)  KRAMER  Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.  ELAINE  Is that tomorrow? KRAMER  Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)  ELAINE  Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.  KRAMER  Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.  JERRY  It's hard enough living next door.  KRAMER  I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.   (Jerry stands up and gets a bottle of ketchup from the next table.)  ELAINE  New jeans? JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  Still a 31 waist? JERRY  Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.  ELAINE  Lena Small? JERRY  Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.  ELAINE  Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!  JERRY  Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.  ELAINE  You're a taking person. JERRY  That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.  ELAINE  She's gonna ask how you got her number.  JERRY  Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.  ELAINE  What's he look like? JERRY  I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.  ELAINE  You're buying a speedboat? JERRY  See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.  ELAINE  I don't know about that. JERRY  So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?  ELAINE  Well... JERRY  Yeah. So you really like this guy.  ELAINE  Very much. JERRY  How's the...sexual chemistry? ELAINE  Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)  KRAMER  Are you still on the pill? ELAINE  Uh, Kramer... KRAMER  I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.  ELAINE  The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.  KRAMER  But wasn't that taken off the market?  ELAINE  Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.  KRAMER  I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.   (Elaine laughs.)  (Jerry on the phone in his apartment) JERRY  Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...   George and Susan in George's car. SUSAN  You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.  GEORGE  Not as thin as you think. SUSAN  Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.  GEORGE  The tag, huh? SUSAN  Mmm-hmm. GEORGE  Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.  SUSAN  What are you talking about? GEORGE  He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.  SUSAN  Oh, how could he be so vain? GEORGE  Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.  SUSAN  Why not? GEORGE  Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.  SUSAN  Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.  GEORGE  Where did you get that from? SUSAN  Well, we're a couple. It's understood.  GEORGE  I never heard of that. SUSAN  Well, you've never been a couple. GEORGE  I've coupled! I've coupled! SUSAN  Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.  GEORGE  This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!   George arrives at Jerry's apartment. GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  Hey. What's the matter? GEORGE  I had a fight with Susan. JERRY  What about? GEORGE  Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?  JERRY  I got a date with that girl, Lena.  GEORGE  Lena, how'd you meet her? JERRY  I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)  GEORGE  You met her a few weeks ago, but...?  JERRY  I didn't call her till today. GEORGE  So, uh...wanna double? JERRY  What? GEORGE  Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.  JERRY  I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey. ELAINE  Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.  JERRY  So what are you gonna do? ELAINE  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.  GEORGE  Just for these sponges? ELAINE  Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?  GEORGE  I dunno. ELAINE  You don't know? GEORGE  I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)  JERRY  What are you all out of breath from?  KRAMER  The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.  JERRY  And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.  KRAMER  Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!  JERRY  I got a 31 waist, mister! KRAMER  Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?  JERRY  What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.   a musical montage of Elaine's \"hard-target search\" - visiting stores and pharmacies all over town and not finding a sponge anywhere. She ends up at the Pasteur Pharmacy.  PHARMACIST  Can I help you? ELAINE  Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...  PHARMACIST  Actually, we have a case left. ELAINE  A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?  PHARMACIST  Sixty. ELAINE  Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.  PHARMACIST  Three. ELAINE  Make it ten. PHARMACIST  Ten? ELAINE  Twenty sponges should be plenty. PHARMACIST  Did you say twenty? ELAINE  Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.  PHARMACIST  Right. So, you're set with twenty-five.  ELAINE  Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.   Jerry and Lena having dinner in a restaurant with George and Susan.  JERRY  Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.  LENA  Mmm! Very nice. JERRY  It's All-Tempa-Cheer. LENA  I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.  GEORGE  Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.  LENA  Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m.  JERRY  They serve soup at 6 a.m.? LENA  Yeah. That's all they have. JERRY  Do the bums ever complain? \"Soup again?\"  GEORGE  I'd get tired of it. JERRY  How could you not? LENA  Guess who volunteered last week? GEORGE  Mick Jagger. LENA  No. Maya Angelou. SUSAN  Oh, the poet! JERRY  So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?  LENA  I don't know. SUSAN  So, did you get to talk to her? LENA  Talk to who? JERRY  Is it a lot of cream soups? SUSAN  Maya Angelou, the poet. LENA  No, I didn't get the chance. GEORGE  Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?   (Jerry gives George a surprised look. George looks back, puzzled.)  SUSAN  I'm going to the ladies room. LENA  I'll go with you. (They leave.) GEORGE  What are you looking at me like that for?  JERRY  Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?  GEORGE  What are you talking about? JERRY  Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.   (George's interest is peaked.)  George and Susan in the car on the way home. SUSAN  Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!  GEORGE  I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.  SUSAN  But you told me anyway? GEORGE  Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.  SUSAN  Thank you, honey. GEORGE  So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?  SUSAN  Can we stop by a drug store first?  GEORGE  What for? SUSAN  I'm out of birth control stuff. GEORGE  Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)  SUSAN  Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.  GEORGE  Me run in? Why don't you run in? SUSAN  You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?  GEORGE  Of course I do. SUSAN  You do? What? GEORGE  You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)  SUSAN  The what? GEORGE  You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)  SUSAN  Just get me some sponges, please. GEORGE  Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.  SUSAN  Off the market? The sponge? GEORGE  Yeah, so you gotta use something else.  SUSAN  I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!  GEORGE  O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.   Jerry approaching his apartment door. He hears the sound of a loud group of people from inside Kramer's place. He knocks on Kramer's door. Kramer answers.  JERRY  Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?  KRAMER  It's a poker game...(yells to the crowd) And I'm kickin' some serious butt!  JERRY  Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!  KRAMER  Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!  JERRY  You're never gonna make it!  (Kramer giggles and returns to the game.)  Elaine and Billy in Elaine's apartment, kissing passionately on the sofa.  BILLY  You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?  ELAINE  O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)  GEORGE  Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?  ELAINE  Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?  GEORGE  Well...Susan. ELAINE  Ah, Susan uses the sponge. GEORGE  Susan loves the sponge. ELAINE  Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.  GEORGE  What? ELAINE  I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)  GEORGE  Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?  ELAINE  Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)  GEORGE  Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.  ELAINE  I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!   (Elaine goes into the bathroom for a sponge, but then stops and reconsiders.)   Susan talking on the phone with Monica. SUSAN  So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list.   (Cut to Monica at home talking on the phone with Susan.) MONICA  He got her number off an AIDS walk list?   (Cut to Lena at home talking on the phone with Monica.) LENA  He what?  Commercial break.  Jerry and Lena in Jerry's apartment. JERRY  How'd you find out? LENA  A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.  JERRY  George! LENA  Pardon? JERRY  Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -  LENA  It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.  JERRY  You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?  LENA  No, not at all. No problem. (Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of Kramer's apartment.)  KRAMER  Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!  JERRY  You went all night? KRAMER  Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh? JERRY  Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!  KRAMER  AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!  JERRY  So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.  GEORGE  Really? How'd she do that? JERRY  A friend of a friend of Susan's. GEORGE  My Susan? JERRY  Why'd you tell her?! GEORGE  Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!  JERRY  Well you know what this means, don't you?  GEORGE  What? //tinyurl.com/2b9c width=200 ) JERRY  You're cut off, you're out of the loop!  GEORGE  You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!  JERRY  You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!  GEORGE  C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.  JERRY  If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?  GEORGE  Hey, a \"hit\" is a totally different story.  JERRY  I don't know, George. GEORGE  So, Lena was upset, huh? JERRY  You know what? That was the amazing thing.  GEORGE  What, it didn't bother her? JERRY  No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.  GEORGE  What? JERRY  She's too good. GEORGE  Too good... JERRY  I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!  GEORGE  I see what you mean. JERRY  I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.  GEORGE  Where's the depravity? JERRY  No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.   (Elaine enters.) JERRY  On the other hand... ELAINE  What? GEORGE  Thanks again for last night! ELAINE  Hey, I didn't even use one. JERRY  I thought you said it was imminent.  ELAINE  Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.  JERRY  Sponge-worthy? ELAINE  Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.  JERRY  But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?  ELAINE  Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.  GEORGE  You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!   Kramer signing in at the AIDS walk. KRAMER  Uh, Cosmo Kramer? ORGANIZER  Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon.  KRAMER  Uh, no thanks. ORGANIZER  You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?  KRAMER  No. ORGANIZER  But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.  KRAMER  I have to? ORGANIZER  Yes. KRAMER  See, that's why I don't want to. ORGANIZER  But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!  KRAMER  You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. (Walks away.)  ORGANIZER  Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!   George and Susan in a booth at the coffee shop. GEORGE  Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.  SUSAN  Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.  GEORGE  Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.  SUSAN  Just once...for the make-up sex. GEORGE  Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.  SUSAN  Come on, just once? GEORGE  No, no...I hate the condom. SUSAN  Why? GEORGE  I can never get the package open in time.  SUSAN  Well, you just tear it open. GEORGE  It's not that easy. It's like \"Beat The Clock,\" there's a lot of pressure there.   Kramer in the AIDS walk. WALKER #1  Hey, where's your ribbon? KRAMER  Oh, I don't wear the ribbon. WALKER #2  Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS?  KRAMER  Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.  WALKER #3  Who do you think you are? WALKER #1  Put the ribbon on! WALKER #2  Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon! (Cedric and Bob turn around and glare at Kramer.)  BOB  Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.)   Elaine and Billy in her apartment. ELAINE  So, you think you're sponge-worthy?  BILLY  Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy.  ELAINE  Run down your case for me again...?  BILLY  Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it.  ELAINE  You going to do something about your sideburns?  BILLY  Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns.  ELAINE  And the bathroom in your apartment?  BILLY  Cleaned it this morning. ELAINE  The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?  BILLY  Everything, yeah. It's spotless. ELAINE  Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)   Jerry arrives at Lena's apartment. JERRY  Hi. LENA  Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins.  JERRY  Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.  LENA  Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.  JERRY  Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -  LENA  Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. (Goes into the bathroom.) Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?  JERRY  Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)  JERRY'S BRAIN  Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.  LENA  Thanks. So, you were saying...? JERRY  What? Nothing. LENA  No, you said I was a good person...  JERRY  Oh... LENA  You seem like you want to tell me something.  JERRY  Tell you something...I do. LENA  What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.  JERRY  Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?  LENA  Yeah. JERRY  I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)   George and Susan in bed. We see George's hands struggling to open a condom wrapper.  SUSAN  Come on, George, just tear it open.  GEORGE  I'm trying, dammit. SUSAN  Tear it. GEORGE  I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.  SUSAN  Here give it to me. GEORGE  Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)  SUSAN  Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!  GEORGE  It's too late.  Kramer surrounded by Cedric, Bob, and the other walkers. BOB  So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?  KRAMER  No! Never. BOB  But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?  KRAMER  This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!  CEDRIC  What are we gonna do with him? BOB  I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!   (Kramer tries to climb up a fire escape, but the mob grabs him and pulls him back down. Kramer screams.)   Jerry and George waiting for Kramer at the finish line. JERRY  It completely turned her off. GEORGE  Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?  JERRY  I don't wanna be a 32. GEORGE  I'd kill to be a 32. JERRY  She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!  GEORGE  That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?  JERRY  It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.  GEORGE  You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.  JERRY  Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?   (They see Kramer staggering towards them with cuts and bruises, clothes torn, one shoe off. He collapses and crawls across the finish line.)  JERRY  Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)  GEORGE  Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?  (Kramer looks at George unbelievingly.)  Elaine and Billy in bed the next morning. ELAINE  Good morning. BILLY  How'd you sleep? ELAINE  Great. You? BILLY  Fine, fine. Everything o.k.? ELAINE  Yep. BILLY  No regrets? ELAINE  Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?  BILLY  What do you mean? ELAINE  Oh...I don't think so. BILLY  Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.  ELAINE  I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.) THE END>",

(pops gum in his mouth) It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school, and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say. (as sarcastic teen) 'Oh, World War Two. That was an important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man on the moon, nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'

KRAMER  (removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex   (Theatre) JERRY  That stinky old movie-house? KRAMER  (sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.  GEORGE  (gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?  KRAMER  (lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.  JERRY  Geoffrey who? KRAMER  Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.  GEORGE  Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?  KRAMER  Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.  GEORGE  Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?  KRAMER  Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.  JERRY  I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.  KRAMER  Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.  GEORGE  Really? KRAMER  Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.  JERRY  Oh, then I'm not worried.  Lloyd Braun enters in the background. KRAMER  But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.   Lloyd wanders toward the guys at the table. GEORGE  (thoughtful) Breakdown, huh? LLOYD  Hey Kramer. KRAMER  Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)  LLOYD  How you doing? KRAMER  (slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)  LLOYD  Hi Jerry. JERRY  Lloyd. LLOYD  George.  Lloyd sits beside George. GEORGE  Hello, Lloyd. How you doing? KRAMER  Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.  LLOYD  (offering packet) Gum? JERRY  (peering) That's an interesting package.  LLOYD  Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most delicious gum you've ever tasted.  KRAMER  Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)  LLOYD  George? GEORGE  I don't chew gum. JERRY  (chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?  LLOYD  Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it.  JERRY  Nah, don't bother. LLOYD  No, it's no problem. JERRY  I don't want it. KRAMER  Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.  JERRY  Alright. KRAMER  Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.   (Jerry's Apartment)  George sits at the table examining the contents of his wallet. Jerry is still chewing and by his face, he's not enjoying it.  GEORGE  You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change.   Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.  Elaine enters. ELAINE  Hey. GEORGE  Hey. JERRY  I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y (he spits it into the waste bin)  ELAINE  What kind is that? JERRY  It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.  ELAINE  Lloyd Braun? How's he doing? GEORGE  (almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.  ELAINE  You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?  JERRY  You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.  ELAINE  Yeah? Well, I got news for you. GEORGE  The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'  JERRY  And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.   George snaps his fingers and points to Jerry, signaling his agreement. Then he picks up his jacket and heads for the door.  GEORGE  Right, gotta get going. JERRY  Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?  GEORGE  Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.  JERRY  I thought your parents were outta town?  GEORGE  Why d'you think I'm going now? Queens)  George has parked his car on the street, and gets out. An elderly guy is on the   porch of his house and recognises George. POP  Georgie! GEORGE  Hey, Mr Lazzari. POP  Back in the old neighborhood, ah? GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.  POP  Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron? GEORGE  Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.  POP  The actor, right? GEORGE  Something like that. POP  Mind if I look under the hood? GEORGE  Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.   A young woman has exited from the old guy's house, and approaches.  POP  Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here.   Pop lifts the hood of the car, and leans into the engine compartment.  DEENA  George Costanza, is that you? GEORGE  Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as   pretty as you did back in high school. DEENA  Boy, those were some crazy times. GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?  Lobby)  Kramer is leading Jerry and Elaine on a tour of the Alex. There are a few   customers scattered about and a bored attendant behind the counter. Elaine has a   big bucket of popcorn. KRAMER  The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of   movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two,   fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.  ELAINE  Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?  KRAMER  Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark   status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.  JERRY  Oh, can Lloyd really do that? KRAMER  Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to   Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine. ELAINE  (concerned) What? Lloyd is here?  Kramer indicates Lloyd approaching. ELAINE  What? No, no, I'd rather... LLOYD  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  (big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.  LLOYD  Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit   together. ELAINE  (reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit   in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he,   he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you   afterwards.  Elaine grabs Jerry by the arm and leads him toward the auditorium.  LLOYD  That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?  KRAMER  (emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot   'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.  Auditorium)  Jerry and Elaine sit in the front row of seats. Elaine is eating popcorn.  JERRY  We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special   seats? ELAINE  I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again.   Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.  The lights go down, and music is heard as the show begins. Jerry and Elaine lean   back in their seats to be able to see the screen JERRY  Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.  Queens)  Deena and George are still talking. Pop is under the hood of George's car. Bangs   and clanks can be heard as he fiddles with the mechanics. DEENA  Poor Lloyd. GEORGE  I know. Completely bonkers! DEENA  Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what   happened to Pop. GEORGE  Pop? What happened to Pop? DEENA  I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm   taking care of him.  Pop comes out momentarily. POP  Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more.   He goes back under the hood. GEORGE  (a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?  DEENA  Uhn, it was too much for him.  Pop is thumping away at part of the engine with a spanner. GEORGE  (very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.  DEENA  What? GEORGE  I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop.   Pop, put down the wrench, Pop. Auditorium)  Kramer and Lloyd sits side by side in the special seats, watching Spartacus.   They're smiling happily.  Jerry and Elaine lean uncomfortably back in their front-row seats. They're both   eating popcorn. Elaine drops a piece onto her blouse, where it rests next to a   fancy button. She retrieves the corn, and dislodges the button without noticing.   The button falls to the floor where it rests among other detritus.   (George's Car)  George is driving along the road in his Le Baron. Over the usual engine noise   can be heard a metallic rasping, grinding noise. George listens for a few   moments, wondering where it's coming from. Then he looks concerned, then angry.  GEORGE  Pop! POP!! Lobby)  Kramer and Jerry stand in the lobby. Kramer smoking his pipe, Jerry massaging   his neck. Lloyd wanders over to join them. LLOYD  's a great movie, huh? KRAMER  Yeah. LLOYD  Sorry you forgot those glasses. JERRY  I don't know what I was thinking. LLOYD  How'd you like that gum? JERRY  (noncommittal) Errh. KRAMER  (slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.   Elaine enters. In the absence of the button she lost in the auditorium, her   blouse is open to below her breasts, and everything's in the shop window. Not   that she knows it. ELAINE  Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the   ladies' room. KRAMER  Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.  Elaine is suffering with her neck. She rolls her head back and feels the back of   her neck with her hand. ELAINE  Oh. Oh God. LLOYD  You alright?  Elaine stretches her back and neck, at the same time pushing her upperworks into   greater prominence. ELAINE  Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot   bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.  Elaine leaves. Kramer and Lloyd both stare after her.  (Street Outside Alex)  Elaine walks down the sidewalk, her blouse still open. A florist is using a hose   to wash down the sidewalk in front of his store. Elaine carefully steps by,   picking her way past. The florist also stares at Elaine's exposure.   A cop stands a little further down the street. Elaine approaches him.  ELAINE  Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a   hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he   just use a broom?  The cop stares at Elaine's breasts the whole time she's talking.  COP  Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose.   Elaine looks confused about his attitude. She glances down, and notices her   blouse wide open. She quickly pulls her coat closed, to hide her embarrassment,   and hurries away.  (Jerry's Apartment)  Kramer is handing Jerry a pair of spectacles. KRAMER  Yeah, put these glasses on. JERRY  (taking them) Well, what's this for?  KRAMER  Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.  JERRY  So what? KRAMER  Well, he thinks you wear those.  Jerry looks at the glasses with some distaste. KRAMER  They're from the lost and found at the Alex.  JERRY  Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.  KRAMER  Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on   purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.  (Monk's)  George leans on the counter by the cash register, behind which sits Ruthie   Cohen. GEORGE  'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you   with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.  CASHIER  I don't think so. GEORGE  Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill   and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles)   that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register? CASHIER  Not unless you buy something. GEORGE  Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.  Lloyd approaches the register to pay for something. The cashier rings up   George's purchase. LLOYD  Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?  GEORGE  I don't.  Ruthie opens the drawer on the register. CASHIER  Take a look.  George goes round to the other side of the register and picks up all the   twenty-dollar bills. He shuffles through them, examining them for doodles.  GEORGE  I know I gave it to you. LLOYD  George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.   In addition to Lloyd, another customer is waiting to pay. GEORGE  (frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door)   Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't   forget that easily!  (Jerry's Apartment)  Jerry is reading a newspaper, and holding it in such a way as to conceal his   face. KRAMER  Hey, Jerry, look who's here.  Jerry folds over the top half of the paper, in order to see his visitor. He also   reveals to all that he is wearing the spectacles Kramer gave him earlier.  JERRY  Ah, Lloyd. LLOYD  Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.   He proffers the packet to Jerry. JERRY  (unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum. KRAMER  Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?  JERRY  (still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)  KRAMER  Oh, boy.  Kramer and Lloyd sit on the couch. All of them start chewing on the gum.  KRAMER  Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting   around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he   can get more of this.  Jerry makes a show of removing his glasses and cleaning them.  JERRY  Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish   anything he sets his mind to.  Jerry puts his glasses back on. LLOYD  Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him,   you can get it whenever you want. JERRY  's not necessary. KRAMER  Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.  JERRY  I know that, Kramer. LLOYD  Well, if you don't want to... KRAMER  No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he   appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry? JERRY  Yes I do, Kramer. LLOYD  So... KRAMER  Yeah? LLOYD  How about that Elaine today, huh? KRAMER  Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?  LLOYD  (to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.  JERRY  I didn't see anything. KRAMER  Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom,   ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.  They continue to chew on the gum. Lloyd seemingly happily, Jerry clearly not   liking it, and Kramer not liking it, but unwilling to show it to Lloyd.   (Park)  George and Deena sit on a bench. DEENA  You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.   George clearly thinks he's clicked. GEORGE  Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.   He pats Deena on the knee. DEENA  I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh,   become very sensitive to the warning signs. GEORGE  Warning signs? DEENA  Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.  GEORGE  (disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the   one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.  DEENA  Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.  GEORGE  All my friends do that. DEENA  George, I'm only trying to help...   George is staring past Deena at something a short distance away.  DEENA  I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?  GEORGE  You see that woman on the horse? (points)   Ruthie Cohen is passing by on horseback. GEORGE  She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've   gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered! DEENA  So again it all comes back to Lloyd.  GEORGE  (rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back   here!! Don't gallop away!!  George runs away, yelling after the retreating Ruthie Cohen.   (Monk's)  Jerry and George sit in a booth. There's a different cashier on duty.  JERRY  So you say she was on a horse? GEORGE  I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.  JERRY  Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if   any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big   lips.  Elaine enters. ELAINE  Hey. JERRY  Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue. ELAINE  (sits beside Jerry) What? JERRY  I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the   peepshow you gave him at the Alex. ELAINE  (laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open.   I musta left it at the theatre. JERRY  Maybe it's in the lost and found. ELAINE  Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too,   you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's. JERRY  You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.  Lobby)  Kramer greets a small elderly gent. KRAMER  Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at   the Alex Theatre. HAARWOOD  Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.  KRAMER  Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?   Kramer ducks behind the counter to retrieve the lost and found box.  HAARWOOD  They're half-glasses.  Kramer pops his head up, a thought having occurred. KRAMER  Brown? HAARWOOD  Mmm, yes, yes.  Kramer places the cardboard box marked 'Lost and Found' on the counter.  KRAMER  Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up   soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some   paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.  HAARWOOD  Certainly.  Kramer leaves. Haarwood begins to rummage through the contents of the box. After   a few seconds, he finds something. He lifts it out for a closer look. It's the   button Elaine dropped earlier. HAARWOOD  Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.  Street Outside Alex)  George starts his car. It's still making unhealthy noises.  As he sits with the engine running, a car pulls up in the street behind him. The   driver sounds the horn at George as he sits in his parking spot.  GEORGE  (glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.   The horn sounds again. GEORGE  (getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!   The horn sounds several more times, impatiently. George has had enough. He   climbs out of his car. GEORGE  (angrily) Oh you mother...  George stalks round his car and up to the driver's window of the car sounding   its horn. GEORGE  Hey! What is your problem?  The driver rolls down the window, and we see Ruthie Cohen. GEORGE  Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that   meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug)   Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?  CASHIER  Your car's on fire.  The reflection of leaping flames can be seen in Ruthie's window. George dashes   off back to his car. GEORGE  Aah! Fire! CASHIER  (after George) Merry Christmas!  Flames are coming from under the hood of the Le Baron. GEORGE  (shouting) Fire!!  The florist is standing holding a broom. George rushes to him.  GEORGE  Your hose! Where's your hose?! FLORIST  Cop made me disconnect it.  George grabs the broom from the florist, and begins beating at the flames with   no effect. After a few seconds, the broom is alight.  (Street Outside Alex)  The whole front of George's car is burnt out. The plastic body parts have melted   away. The hood is wide open, showing the devastation within. George stands,   holding the charred remnants of the broom. He's staring catatonically at the   damage. Kramer walks up and does a double-take at the sight.  KRAMER  Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?  GEORGE  The Jon Voight car is no more. KRAMER  Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.  GEORGE  No kidding? KRAMER  No kidding. GEORGE  Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one. KRAMER  Yeah, merry Christmas.  Kramer walks on. GEORGE  (staring at the wreck) Whatever. Lobby)  Jerry is waiting. He's wearing the glasses from earlier. JERRY  Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun? KRAMER  What, he's not here yet? JERRY  Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!  KRAMER  Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.   Kramer reaches across and plucks the glasses from Jerry's face.  JERRY  Why? KRAMER  They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.  Kramer rummages in lost and found, and brings out another pair of spectacles.  KRAMER  (proffering) Here, try this pair.  Jerry puts them on. The lenses are much stronger than the first pair - they're   like bottle-bottoms. He stares through them, his eyes magnified hugely. It's   obvious he can't see at all clearly. JERRY  Aw, these are really strong glasses.   He takes a step and almost trips over the counter. LLOYD  Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?  JERRY  (lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah. KRAMER  (clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.  LLOYD  Anybody see Elaine today? KRAMER  Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out   lost and found. LLOYD  Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing,   if you know what I mean.  They chuckle. JERRY  Absolutely. Let's just stick around.  LLOYD  Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog   here. KRAMER  Uh, yeah.  Lloyd goes to the counter, and speaks to the attendant. LLOYD  I'd like a hotdog, please.  The attendant looks to the machine, which contains one hotdog. The appearance of   the article is not pleasant. It's wrinkled, shriveled, and generally   disgusting. ATTENDANT  Are you outta your mind?  Hearing this, Kramer dashes over. KRAMER  Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?  ATTENDANT  This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane   to eat it. KRAMER  No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong   with it or you. LLOYD  Kramer, maybe... KRAMER  No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One   hotdog please. ATTENDANT  (on your head be it) Okay. KRAMER  Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?   The attendant hands over the hotdog. KRAMER  Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious.   Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)   As he chews, it begins to be apparent that all is not as it should be with the   hotdog. KRAMER  Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I   gotta get, some air.  Kramer stumbles toward the exit, bits of half-chewed hotdog falling from his   mouth.  (Street Outside Alex)  Kramer walks stiffly along the sidewalk. He's breathing heavily, and loosening   his collar. He walks by the florist, who is brushing the sidewalk again. As   Kramer passes George's car, his struggle with the rancid hotdog ends with the   hotdog triumphant, and he leans into the gutter behind the Le Baron and vomits   copiously. The florist looks rueful, leans his broom against his door, and   fetches his hose, whilst Kramer continues his refunding. Later)  The florist is hosing away the traces of Kramer's visit. Elaine walks up to him.  ELAINE  Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?  FLORIST  How would you happen to know that?  ELAINE  Well, uhm... I... FLORIST  (accusing) You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?  ELAINE  Uh... I...  A voice calls from across the street. VOICE  Hey, Joe!  The florist turns to see who's shouting. As he does, he raises the nozzle of his   hose, so instead of hosing the sidewalk, he sprays Elaine. ELAINE  No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!   The florist notices what he's done and turns off the hose. Lobby)  Jerry sits beside Kramer, who still looks unwell. Lloyd stands comforting   Kramer. Elaine enters. She has removed her jacket, and is wearing a wringing wet   t-shirt. ELAINE  Hey. Hey everybody. LLOYD  Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry,   let's go. Car's out front.  Lloyd leaves. Jerry stands and peers about himself through the over-strength   glasses. All he can make out are vague blurred shapes. JERRY  Lloyd?  He moves across the lobby, slowly, holding his hands out to feel for obstacles.  JERRY  Lloyd?  Jerry leaves. ELAINE  (exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?  KRAMER  Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this   is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt. ELAINE  Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose. KRAMER  Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your   swing joints.  Elaine casts her eyes heavenward.  (Street Outside Alex)  The remains of George's car are being towed away. On the opposite side of the   road, watching, are Deena and George. DEENA  So, you want my father to pay for this?  GEORGE  You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did   there. DEENA  And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.  GEORGE  No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.  DEENA  What cashier? GEORGE  You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.  DEENA  To park her horse? GEORGE  No, she wasn't on the horse. DEENA  So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?  GEORGE  That's right.  Across the street, the florist is outside his store, arranging flowers.  GEORGE  (points) And him! DEENA  The man with the flowers? GEORGE  Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little   crazy, but...  A car pulls up beside George and Deena. George looks in the window.  GEORGE  I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.  DEENA  Who? GEORGE  Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to   Jerry) Jerry.  Jerry hears his name called and turns his head, but all he can see are blurry   colored shapes. GEORGE  Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!  The car pulls away, leaving George calling after it. GEORGE  Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...  DEENA  (doubtful) That was your best friend?  GEORGE  Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.  DEENA  That man was wearing glasses. GEORGE  I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!   (Lloyd Braun's Car)  Jerry and Lloyd have reached Chinatown. Lloyd parks the car.  LLOYD  I'll run in and get the gum. JERRY  Alright. LLOYD  Got any money?  Jerry digs his wallet out of his pocket. He opens it and extracts a bill. He   peers at it, trying to work out what denomination it is, but the glasses are   still too strong. JERRY  (handing it over) Here.  Lloyd takes the bill, looks at it, smiles a little with surprise.  LLOYD  (climbing out of the car) I'll be back.   (Street)  George and Deena walk along together. GEORGE  Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a   series of bad coincidences. DEENA  I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.  GEORGE  Believe me, I am not crazy. DEENA  Well, I guess it's possible.  (Lloyd Braun's Car)  Jerry sits waiting. Lloyd gets in. He has a stack of six boxes, which he hands   to Jerry. LLOYD  Here y'go. JERRY  (indistinct) Got all this? LLOYD  Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth. JERRY  (incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!  LLOYD  You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?  JERRY  It's a lotta gum!  (The Institute)  The room is festooned with props and costumes from old movies.  KRAMER  Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses. HAARWOOD  Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion   Picture Costumes and Wardrobe. KRAMER  Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W. HAARWOOD  Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute.   Kramer notices a particular costume. KRAMER  Is that from Henry the Eighth? HAARWOOD  Yes, yes, it is. KRAMER  Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think   that I could wear that to promote the theatre? HAARWOOD  Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a   man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could   really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat   generous proportions. KRAMER  (an idea occurs) You don't say.  (Street)  Kramer and George walk together. George is wearing the Henry VIII costume -   doublet and hose, cloak, crown, etc. KRAMER  You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so   thrilled. GEORGE  Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.  KRAMER  Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.  GEORGE  (angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute,   wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.  He gets his wallet from under the cape, and goes to the window of a kiosk.  GEORGE  (handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?  GUY  I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on   the president. GEORGE  What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess   I owe that cashier an apology.  Deena is walking toward George and Kramer. She sees George in his costume and   jumps to the obvious conclusion. DEENA  Oh my God! GEORGE  No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.   Deena turns and begins to walk away. GEORGE  Th... this isn't mine.  George begins to walk after Deena, who accelerates to a trot.  GEORGE  I got it from the Institute. The Institute.   Deena breaks into a run, with George chasing her. GEORGE  (shouting) Dee... Deena! Lobby)  Kramer stands behind the counter, upon which Elaine leans. Mr Haarwood enters.  KRAMER  Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.  HAARWOOD  Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?  KRAMER  Oh, he ran away.  Lloyd enters. LLOYD  Hey Kramer. KRAMER  I need to talk to you.  Lloyd and Kramer go away to the side of the lobby, where they go into a quiet   conversation. Elaine is peering over at Mr Haarwood, and in particular at the   button he's wearing on his cravat. ELAINE  You know, that button looks very familiar.  HAARWOOD  Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory. ELAINE  I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've   been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here? HAARWOOD  Yes, it was in the lost and found.  ELAINE  Shall I undo it? HAARWOOD  Oh yes, of course you can. ELAINE  Oh, thank you.  Elaine moves very close to Mr Haarwood, and reaches under his chin to remove the   button. HAARWOOD  I'm a little ticklish. ELAINE  Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.  Kramer and Lloyd are both staring over at the sight of Elaine tickling Mr   Haarwood under the chin, giggling, apparently flirting. LLOYD  We've really gotta get the Elaine a boyfriend.  KRAMER  Oh, tell me about it.   THE END>",

Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.   (club applauds) ELAINE  Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.  JERRY  Maybe he'll write a song about you.  ELAINE  Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.  JERRY  So I take it he's spongeworthy? ELAINE  Oh, yeah. JERRY  Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.  ELAINE  Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.  JERRY  Oh, no? ELAINE  Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning) JERRY  Come on. Come on. ELAINE  I don't wanna! JERRY  Elaine, you're among friends. ELAINE  (sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.  JERRY  Oh. ELAINE  Yeah. It's surprising. JERRY  Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?  ELAINE  No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.  JERRY  Sure. Why not? You're there. ELAINE  Exactly. JERRY  But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.  KRAMER  Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.  JERRY  What stuff? KRAMER  I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.  JERRY  All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.  KRAMER  Course I will. These are staples. JERRY  A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?  KRAMER  Lindsay olives, Jerry. JERRY  A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?  KRAMER  $17.50. You can't beat that. JERRY  Look...look at this can of tuna! KRAMER  Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.  JERRY  This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.  KRAMER  Hey, Clyde! CLYDE  Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude?  KRAMER  Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.  CLYDE  How ya doin'? JERRY  Hi. KRAMER  You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.  JERRY  John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.  CLYDE  Oh yeah? JERRY  Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.  CLYDE  Is that right? KRAMER  Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.  CLYDE  Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life.  ESTELLE  Georgie, can you zip me up? GEORGE  Yeah. Yeah, one second. ESTELLE  Well, come on! GEORGE  All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.  ESTELLE  Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.  GEORGE  My in-laws. Oh, my.... FRANK  So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?  ESTELLE  I don't like that tie. FRANK  What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.  ESTELLE  It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.  FRANK  How do you know what kind of ties they wear?  ESTELLE  Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's   anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead! FRANK  Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.  ESTELLE  George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?  FRANK  Huh? GEORGE  I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.  FRANK  We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.  ESTELLE  It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's?   It's right over here. FRANK  No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something   about taste! GEORGE  This is gonna be fun. JERRY  Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in   your friend John Germaine's band there. ELAINE  So what did he have to say? JERRY  Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.  ELAINE  Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?  JERRY  Yeah. ELAINE  What did you do that for? JERRY  What? ELAINE  What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that   we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and   heavy if he's not hot and heavy. JERRY  Oh ELAINE  I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't   wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.  JERRY  Well, Clyde might not tell him. ELAINE  How do you know that? JERRY  I should have helped Kramer with those packages.  ELAINE  Ohh!  (Kramer, walking down hall to his apartment, his arms loaded with dozens of   pop cans, falls forward, spilling cans about in hallway) DENNIS  Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a   favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder...  KRAMER  Uh-huh. DENNIS  I wonder, could you pick up my mail?  KRAMER  Yeah. Sure. Sure. DENNIS  In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for   the week? KRAMER  Drive the horse? DENNIS  It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a   day. I'll split it with ya. KRAMER  Oh, giddyup. Yeah. GEORGE  This is delicious, Mrs. Ross. MRS. ROSS  Oh. MR. ROSS  What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.  FRANK  What is this thing anyway? MRS. ROSS  It's Cornish gamehen. FRANK  What is that, like a little chicken?  GEORGE  It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's   a gamebird. FRANK  Gamebird? GEORGE  Yeah. FRANK  What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?  MR. ROSS  Yes. FRANK  How hard could it be to kill this thing?  ESTELLE  I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.  MRS. ROSS  If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd   be broke. SUSAN  More wine anyone? FRANK  Yeah. I'll take some. SUSAN  Hmmm? FRANK  Thank you. SUSAN  How do you like the Merlot? ESTELLE  Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?  MRS. ROSS  Oh, mother. GEORGE  She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot. FRANK  Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The   rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?  GEORGE  Why don't we talk about it another time.  FRANK  But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a   chicken. Something's missing! MRS. ROSS  Something's missing all right. MR. ROSS  They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.  FRANK  That's perverse. GEORGE  Did anybody see Firestorm? MR. ROSS  Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.  GEORGE  Yeah. MR. ROSS  Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --  FRANK  Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.  MR. ROSS  It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!  FRANK  Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!  GEORGE  Oh mother of God.  (clip clop) KRAMER  Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by   Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies   could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On   Rusty!  (applause) JOHN  Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's   my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called \" Hot And Heavy.\"   (saxophone playing) GEORGE  Thank God that's over. ESTELLE  The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.  FRANK  And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it   kill them to put out a pound cake? Something! GEORGE  So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.  ESTELLE  It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm   sorry. It's impolite. FRANK  Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to   do something like that! ESTELLE  Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots   drinking coffee without a piece of cake! GEORGE  What is this? The marble rye? MRS. ROSS  Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.  ESTELLE  We forgot to bring it in. FRANK  No, I brought it in. They never put it out.  MRS. ROSS  Where is it? SUSAN  I don't know. Where'd you put it? MRS. ROSS  Right over there. SUSAN  Well, it's gone. GEORGE  You stole the bread? FRANK  What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should   I leave it there? GEORGE  Because we brought it for them! FRANK  Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.  MRS. ROSS  Is it possible they took it back? SUSAN  Who would bring a bread and take it back?  MR. ROSS  Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.  ESTELLE  People take buses to get that rye.  GEORGE  Maybe they forgot to put it out! FRANK  Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I   tell ya! JERRY  He stole back the rye? GEORGE  Yeah. JERRY  Why? GEORGE  Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.  JERRY  So, do the Ross's know? GEORGE  I don't know. They're all very suspicious.  JERRY  Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.  GEORGE  Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all   separated for the rest of my life. JERRY  Bad situation. GEORGE  I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.  JERRY  What do you mean replace it? GEORGE  You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have   to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen   somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is. JERRY  Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?  GEORGE  What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I   can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the   apartment! JERRY  All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the   Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait   a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom   cab. GEORGE  So? JERRY  Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.  GEORGE  And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a   hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that? JERRY  Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop,   clip clop. They're nuts for it. GEORGE  So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is   there. JERRY  What about Susan? GEORGE  She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner   with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven   o'clock. JERRY  Beautiful! GEORGE  You think Kramer'll do it? KRAMER  Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there   at seven? GEORGE  Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.  KRAMER  Hey. JERRY  What the hell are you doing there?  KRAMER  It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?  JERRY  No. No thanks. KRAMER  Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any   room for it all. GEORGE  Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread   into the apartment? JERRY  Just put it under your shirt. GEORGE  Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!  JERRY  I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll   come by five after seven right after they leave. GEORGE  Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)  ELAINE  Hey. Is that your horse outside? KRAMER  Yeah. That's Rusty. GEORGE  What? He's outside? KRAMER  Uh-huh. GEORGE  Aw, come on. I wanna go see him. KRAMER  You wanna go see him? GEORGE  Yeah. Hey! Hey! KRAMER  I'll show ya Rusty. GEORGE  Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?  ELAINE  Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in   a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just   great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then   you have to come along with your hot and your heavy. JERRY  So, you think Clyde told him? ELAINE  He wrote a song about it! JERRY  Well, maybe it's a good thing. ELAINE  No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is   like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick   to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?  JERRY  No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very   pleasant. ELAINE  You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you.   It has to! JERRY  No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're   seeing him tonight so talk to him about it. ELAINE  I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late   show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset   him. MR. ROSS  Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We   really appreciate it. GEORGE  Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I   can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha   ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs? MR. ROSS  Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous   George. Anything wrong? GEORGE  Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine.   Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh,   could I get a glass of water? MRS. ROSS  We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got   water. KRAMER  Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno.   (singing) I'm so keen-o  On Beef-A-Reeno  What a delicious cuisine-o  Fit for a king and queen-o!  Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans. MR. ROSS  Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George?  MRS. ROSS  You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in   ....years. GEORGE  (thinking) Oh my God, it's 7:01. What have I done? My whole plan is   depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a   stupid mistake? He'll never show up!  (clip clop) KRAMER  Ah ha! GEORGE  There he is. Right on time as usual.  COUNTER WOMAN  53. MABEL  53. I'd like a marble rye, no plastic, in a bag.  COUNTER WOMAN  Ah! You're lucky. It's our last one.  JERRY  Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?  COUNTER WOMAN  That's right. JERRY  There's none left? COUNTER WOMAN  That's what I said. Number 54. JERRY  Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have   that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may   depend on it. MABEL  Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier.  JERRY  Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to   give it up. MABEL  You're not getting this rye -- JERRY  All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you   double what you paid for it. MABEL  You're in my way! KRAMER  Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for   this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot   chocolate if the mood should strike you. MRS. ROSS  My favorite. KRAMER  Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me   show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh,   happy anniversary. On, Rusty!  (clip clop) JERRY  All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be   reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye. MABEL  No? Watch me. JERRY  Give me that rye! MABEL  Stop it! JERRY  I want that rye, lady! MABEL  Help! Someone help! JERRY  Shut up, you old bag! MABEL  Stop thief! Stop him! He's got my marble rye!  ELAINE  I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got   your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I   know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you   that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and   heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy? JOHN  Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed.  ELAINE  Disappointed? JOHN  Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that.  ELAINE  You were? JOHN  Absolutely. ELAINE  Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved! JOHN  Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before the next   show. My place is only a few blocks from here. ELAINE  Really? JOHN  And you know what? ELAINE  What? JOHN  I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding a new   number to my, you know, repertoire. ELAINE  Ohh!  (clip clop)  (Rusty snorting) KRAMER  Y'aah!  (clip clop)  (Rusty farts) MRS. ROSS  (sniffing) What is that? MR. ROSS  I think it's the horse. MRS. ROSS  Oh, God. KRAMER  Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?  MRS. ROSS  This is - this is...horrible. MR. ROSS  Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal?  KRAMER  Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.  MRS. ROSS  I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!  MR. ROSS  Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here!   And hurry it up! KRAMER  Rusty! Rusty! GEORGE  (whistling)  (clip clopping beginning in distance and growing discernibly louder)  KRAMER  Whoa! GEORGE  Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?  MR. ROSS  Ask Rusty. KRAMER  I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the   gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.  MRS. ROSS  Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.  GEORGE  What the hell happened? KRAMER  The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.  GEORGE  Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!  KRAMER  Well, I overbought! MR. ROSS  George. GEORGE  (muttering) MUSIC GUY  What's going on? Where is he? MANAGER  Uh...he'll be here soon. MUSIC GUY  I'll give him ten more minutes. I'm not gonna stay here all night.  JERRY  How much did you give him? KRAMER  Just a can. But he really liked it, though.  GEORGE  Jerry! Up here! JERRY  Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?  GEORGE  I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!  JERRY  Really? GEORGE  Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?  JERRY  Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.  KRAMER  I don't wanna go back on there! GEORGE  Come on! JERRY  (grunting as he throws bread into the air)  GEORGE  (grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.  ELAINE  No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.  GEORGE  Come on! Come on! JERRY  Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.   (George finally gets rye into apartment, turning around to discover everyone staring at him)  GEORGE  Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)  MANAGER  Ladies and gentlemen, John Germaine.   (applause)  (John attempts to play saxophone, discovering that no sound is being created by the instrument)  THE END>",

GEORGE  I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.  JERRY  How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?  GEORGE  I don't know, about three days.  (Kramer enters with golf clubs) JERRY  Y-you're not playin' golf? KRAMER  Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.  GEORGE  Are the courses open? KRAMER  No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.   George. Huh, No kidding? KRAMER  Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. Oh, that's my dream, Jerry. JERRY  Really, you're getting that good? KRAMER  Oh, I'm the real deal.

Between the two of   them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! JERRY  Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.  (Elaine enters) ELAINE  Hey. JERRY  Hey. GEORGE  Hey, how ya doing?!? ELAINE  Better, now. JERRY  yeah, what happened? ELAINE  You know Sue Ellen Mishke? JERRY  Sue Ellen Mishke? ELAINE  Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last   year... JERRY  Sounds familiar. ELAINE  The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--  JERRY  Oh, yeah, you mentioned her. ELAINE  Yes. I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra. GEORGE  Ah, that is disgusting-- JERRY  That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--  GEORGE  The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--  JERRY  It's wrong, it's rude, and it's-- GEORGE  It's disgusting-- ELAINE  Alright, there's no--- GEORGE  Come on! Come-on. JERRY  We're only kidding! ELAINE  You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. I was at this party, and I was dating this really cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door! JERRY  She's your Lex Luthor! ELAINE  Her birthday's comin' up, so I decided to get her a little present. JERRY  What are you going to get her? ELAINE  A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.  JERRY  There's nothing subtle about that.  GEORGE  No, no, she might just think its a gift.  JERRY  Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?   (The coffee shop) GEORGE  Ahhh, Hey-Ho. JERRY  What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!? GEORGE  Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin! JERRY  So, you're just taking off from work?  GEORGE  They won't know. I got the car there.  JERRY  Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion? GEORGE  My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.   (Elaine's office at J Peterman) ELAINE  Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.   (Sue Ellen enters, wearing the brazier as a top, with a black blazer)  SUE ELLEN  Hi Elaine. ELAINE  Hellllloo. SUE ELLEN  I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift. ELAINE  Ohhhhh. You're....welcome. SUE ELLEN  Is anything wrong? ELAINE  Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.  SUE ELLEN  Oh, I know. Thanks again.  (The Rosses cabin) GEORGE  This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?  SUSAN  Wanna check out a swap meet? GEORGE  Yeah, maybe. Where'd you get that?  SUSAN  Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that   rest stop.  (George sits up suddenly)  (Jerry's apartment, phone ringing) JERRY  Yello. GEORGE  Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.  JERRY  What's goin' on? GEORGE  I just remembered, there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars. JERRY  Yeah, so? GEORGE  Alright, this is what ya gotta do: I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, and take the flyers off my car.  JERRY  You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!? GEORGE  Alright, alright. I'll drive the 4 hours each way, 6 hours all   together, and take 'em off myself!! JERRY  Alright, alright, I'll do it!!  (Jerry hangs up, Kramer enters Jerry's apartment) JERRY  Hey, what are ya up to?  Kramer. Nothin'. JERRY  Do ya wanna go with me up to the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car. KRAMER  Sure! JERRY  I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I?  KRAMER  yep.  (Yankee Stadium parking lot.)  (George's car is covered with flyers bird droppings) JERRY  Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this? What are we gonna do? KRAMER  I don't know. JERRY  Well, we gotta get it washed....Ah, the keys are locked inside!  KRAMER  Wait a second.... JERRY  What are ya gonna do? KRAMER  I'll just snag the lock with this. Here we go...  JERRY  Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?   (Jerry and Kramer driving George's car, after the car wash.   Kramer is behind the wheel.) KRAMER  George has gotta be happy about this.  JERRY  Yeah, yeah, yeah... JERRY  Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?   (Sue Ellen is seen walking down the street) KRAMER  Oh, mama. JERRY  Kramer!!!  (Car crashes into a lamp post)  (Commercial)  (Jerry's Apartment) ELAINE  My God, are you okay? KRAMER  I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder.  JERRY  I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it. ELAINE  So how did this happen? JERRY  He was starin' at some woman! KRAMER  I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.  ELAINE  What woman? JERRY  There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing just a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind. ELAINE  Oh...my God. JERRY  What? ELAINE  Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?  JERRY  Yeah! ELAINE  Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke! JERRY  Sue Ellen Mishke? ELAINE  That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society. KRAMER  You know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my   golf swing.  (Kramer makes a golf swing motion and collapses in pain)  (Stan enters) STAN  I got your message, how's the shoulder?  KRAMER  Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!  STAN  No, no. Not the left arm! KRAMER  What happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams? ELAINE  Oh! I got it! Let's sue her! KRAMER  Sue her? ELAINE  Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar   fortune. KRAMER  No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company. ELAINE  Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held   accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!  KRAMER  What do you think, Stan? STAN  Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?   (Kramer smiles)  (Jackie Chiles' office) JACKIE  So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business? KRAMER  Yeah. JACKIE  Then what happened? KRAMER  The we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.  JACKIE  No top? She didn't have a top on? KRAMER  No. So I got distracted and I crashed the car.  JACKIE  Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was an attractive woman? KRAMER  Oh, yeah. JACKIE  So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!  KRAMER  She was flouting. JACKIE  That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious, outrageous! KRAMER  It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar   fortune. JACKIE  Could you repeat that? KRAMER  I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.  JACKIE  O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding!   Have you been to a doctor? KRAMER  No. JACKIE  Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an  appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me. KRAMER  So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?  JACKIE  Like taking candy from a baby.  (The cabin) GEORGE  I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim   Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way you have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha. SUSAN  I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.  GEORGE  Would ya stop worrying? SUSAN  Well, what about the flyers? GEORGE  Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.  (Yankee Stadium parking lot)  (Jerry having difficulty parking the car. After getting the car in the space, Jerry leans against the door, trying to close it. Finally he gives up and leaves, kicking a piece of the car under it as he goes)   (Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)  STEINBRENNER  Come in!  (Wilhelm enters) STEINBRENNER  Ah, Wilhelm. WILHELM  Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.  STEINBRENNER  How 'bout a 'good morning'? WILHELM  Yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.  STEINBRENNER  Good morning to you, Wilhelm. WILHELM  Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is based in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere.   Obviously he was in some sort of terrible car accident, and, trooper that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir. STEINBRENNER  Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen. Put everyone on   alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've gotta find   that kid. WILHELM  Yes sir, yes sir. STEINBRENNER  We must find George, find him, Wilhelm!   (The hallway in Jerry's building)  (As Jerry walks down the hall to his apartment, he finds Sue Ellen knocking on Kramer's door) SUE ELLEN  Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall? JERRY  Yes, yes, I do. SUE ELLEN  Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?  JERRY  No, I don't. SUE ELLEN  Oh... JERRY  Is there something I can help you with?  SUE ELLEN  No, I really just needed to speak with him.  JERRY  Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.  SUE ELLEN  Oh, maybe I will.  (Jerry quickly unlocks his door, before she can change her mind)  SUE ELLEN  If you don't mind. JERRY  No, no, not at all. SUE ELLEN  Thanks. JERRY  I'm Jerry Seinfeld.  (Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)  STEINBRENNER  What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come in. WILHELM  Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, we've searched everywhere, there's no sign of him. Not even anyone who remotely fits his   description, sir. STEINBRENNER  Oh my God, do you know what this means, Wilhelm?  WILHELM  What, sir? STEINBRENNER  He's dead! Costanza's dead! WILHELM  Well, no, no, you see, I don't think--  STEINBRENNER  As quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little guy! Easy. Easy, big Stein, get it together. Ok, Wilhelm. WILHELM  Yessir? STEINBRENNER  Find out where his parents live. WILHELM  Parents. STEINBRENNER  I'm gonna personally notify them. ...and, ah, line up some candidates to fill that assistant to the General Manager position, we can't grieve forever! We gotta get back to business! Back to Business Wilhelm!  (Jerry's Apartment)  (Kramer enters) KRAMER  Well, buddy, he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it! JERRY  Oh, really? KRAMER  Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on? JERRY  I don't know, so the woman was walking around in a bra, I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road. KRAMER  Well, your attitude has certainly changed.  JERRY  I don't think my attitude has changed.  KRAMER  Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.  JERRY  Well, I don't know if I.... KRAMER  Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify! JERRY  I don't think I-- KRAMER  Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry! JERRY  Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.  KRAMER  Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?  JERRY  Nothing's happened. KRAMER  Goohhhhck.  (As Kramer begins to leave, he notices an O'Henry wrapper in the garbage   can) KRAMER  Ohhhh, what's this? JERRY  Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second,...  KRAMER  I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she? JERRY  Kramer, it is not what you think. KRAMER  Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over   this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down   the river. JERRY  And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans! KRAMER  You're just out for sex! JERRY  You're just out for money! KRAMER AND JERRY  Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!  (The Costanza house, Queens)  (Steinbrenner is knocking, Estelle open the door) STEINBRENNER  Mrs. Costanza? ESTELLE  Yesss? STEINBRENNER  My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some very sad new about your son.  (Scene changes to Costanza living room) ESTELLE  I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened? STEINBRENNER  Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. That kid was a human   dynamo. ESTELLE  Are you sure you're talking about George?  STEINBRENNER  You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza? FRANK  What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?!? He had 30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year, he's got a rocket for an arm, you   don't know what the hell you're doin'!! STEINBRENNER  Well, Buener was a good prospect, no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat. They kept saying 'Ken Phelps , Ken Phelps'.  (Jerry entering his apartment, as Frank is leaving a message on his answering machine) FRANK  Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr.  Steinbrenner is here, George is dead, call me back!  (The phone rings again) JERRY  Hello? GEORGE  Hey, it's George. JERRY  Where have you been?!? GEORGE  What? JERRY  I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead! GEORGE  Dead? JERRY  Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a little crumpled. GEORGE  My car is a little crumpled?!? JERRY  Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, and now that's why Steinbrenner thinks   you're dead! GEORGE  Okay, I gotta head back right away, I'll -- I gotta figure something out here. JERRY  Well you gotta call your parents. GEORGE  I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!  JERRY  Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?  GEORGE  Nnnooo! They could use the break!  (Elaine's office at J Peterman)  (Elaine is at her desk, Peterman enters) PETERMAN  Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding is my hands? ELAINE  Yeah, it's a bra. PETERMAN  I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day. ELAINE  What is this all about? PETERMAN  I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy.....Have it on my desk by the end of the week.   (Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)  STEINBRENNER  Come in, come in.  (George enters, with a bandage on his head, walking with crutches)  GEORGE  Mr. Steinbrenner-- STEINBRENNER  Ahhh, Ahhh! Ah, ah ah! Is it you? GEORGE  Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. After the car accident, I crawled into a ditch and managed to survive on grubs and   puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up. STEINBRENNER  Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.  GEORGE  Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much. STEINBRENNER  Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager. GEORGE  I didn't get the job? STEINBRENNER  Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our hands. We had to make a move...  (Dejected, George turns to leave, no longer walking with he crutches,   and takes the bandage off his head) STEINBRENNER  But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have to dock you for the time you missed. We're running a ball club here. If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos! And I can tell you this, chaos does not work for the New York Yankees! Not as long as I'm running the show!  (Courtroom) JACKIE  So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct? ELAINE  Yes...ummm, yes, that's correct.  (Sue Ellen leans back and smiles at Jerry, Kramer notices, worried)  JACKIE  And you have also brought with you, another bra, exactly like the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in! ELAINE  Yes, that's correct.  (Kramer is now on the witness stand) JACKIE  What was you golf score, the last round you played...before you   shoulder was injured? KRAMER  Three under par.  (Stan nods proudly) JACKIE  Oooohhhh, three under par...That's what the professionals shoot, isn't it? KRAMER  If they're lucky.  (Stan laughs)  (Jerry is now on the witness stand) JACKIE  Would you tell this jury exactly what you saw on the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus? JERRY  I...don't remember. JACKIE  Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra? JERRY  I don't know. Maybe. JACKIE  Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing the bra?!? JERRY  ....Alright, alright, I saw her! And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free   wheeling attitude! JUDGE  This court will come to order! JACKIE  No further questions, your honor. JUDGE  You may step down. JACKIE  I think we got this wrapped up. KRAMER  Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?  STAN  You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup.  KRAMER  What do you mean? STAN  Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.  JACKIE  No, no, no, no! KRAMER  Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man. JACKIE  Stan? Who the hell is Stan? KRAMER  He's my caddy. JACKIE  You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!  KRAMER  G- cada- JACKIE  Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.  JUDGE  This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.   (Sue Ellen proceeds to try on the bra, over her top, but it seems too small) SUE ELLEN  Ah, it doesn't fit...I can't put it on.  JACKIE  Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy! This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bra gotta fit right up a person's skin, like a glove!   (Elaine's office)  (Two women enter wearing bras as tops) WOMAN #1  Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?  ELAINE  Oh, no, I don't think so. WOMAN #2  Great job on the Gatzby Swing Top. It's a winner.  ELAINE  Yeah, yeah, thanks. WOMAN #1  Are you sure you don't wanna go? We have reservations.  ELAINE  Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.  WOMAN #1  Ciao. WOMAN #2  Ba-bye.  (Elaine makes a gun with her fingers and points it to her head)  THE END>",

Thank you very much.\" The compliment  is for the tie,it's not for you,but  we take it.That's kind of the job of  clothes;to get compliments for us, because it's very hard to get compliments  based on your human qualities.Right? Let's face it,no matter how nice a  person you are,nobody's gonna come  say \"Hey,nice person.\" It's much easier  to be a bastard and just try and match  the colours up.(Antique Toy Store)Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.They look around at the array of classic teddy bears,toy boats, puppets,etc.ELAINE(awed)Oh,look at this!JERRYBoy,I miss the days they made toys  that could kill a kid.Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned girl's bicycle,with high handlebars,a  pink frame and a basket on the front.ELAINE(excited)Oh,cool!Look at that!Jerry looks over,but his eye is drawn more towards an attractivewoman,Christie,who stands looking at the toys.She's wearing  a dress ofmid-thigh length,black from the bottom of the ribs down,and  white on the chestand arms.JERRY(admiring Christie)Yeah,I'm right  there with ya.ELAINE(excited)That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model!Oh,I always  wanted one of these when I was little.Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the  store,and walks over to some other items.Jerry watches her as she  goes,she noticesand smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged.Jerry is oblivious  to Elaine'svoice.ELAINEWhat d'you think Jerry?Jerry?JERRY(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?ELAINEWhat d'you think?JERRYOh yeah,be great for your paper route.ELAINE(laughs)I love it.I'm getting it.Elaine reaches for the bike,as Jerry turns back to Christie.ELAINECan you help me get it down,Jer?Jerry.CHRISTIEI think your friend needs some help  over there.JERRYYou know,the only way to really help  her is to just let her be.Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the  bike offthe wall on her own.But as she raises it,the weight proves  too much and shefalls backwards,ending up on her back on the floor with the  bike pinning herdown.She struggles to lift it,but can't make much impression, so she ringsthe bell on the bike.Jerry finally has his attention drawn away  from Christie.ELAINEHey!Elaine makes 'So,are you gonna help me?' gestures.(Restaurant)George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie.Carrie  isHeavily pregnant.George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.SUSANA little baby girl?KENDoctor says it could be any day now.GEORGE(through mouthful of food)So,Carrie, you and Susan arecousins.So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right?So whatdoes that make me?CARRIEDoesn't make you anything.GEORGE(jokingly)Well,so,legally,I could  marry your daughter.George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth.

his arms out in a  'tada' gesture.Jerry has on a disgusted face)GEORGEYou see?..You see?!JERRYWell,it doesn't look exactly like her.GEORGEJerry,come on.If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look  like in ten years!JERRYWhy don't you just get rid of it?GEORGEI tried!I almost threw it down the  incinerator,but I couldn't do it.The  guilt was too overwhelming.(Grabs the  doll,opening the door to leave)Susan's  so attached to this thing.JERRYWait,where are you going?Don't take  your dolly and go home.(George shoots him a look,then leaves.He is audible as he meets  up with Elaine in the hallway)GEORGEHi,Elaine.(Elaine shrieks out in fright,then enters Jerry's doorway- breathless)ELAINEDid you see that?!JERRYI'm just glad it's outta here.(Elaine  exhales deeply-getting over the scare  of the doll.She moves into the apartment) What's that?(Pointing to a rolled up  poster Elaine is carrying)ELAINEOh,it's a poster of the three tenors.JERRYOh.(Intercom

you believe  me?ELAINEI don't want it.JERRY(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this.Why wouldn't  you want to get something that's better  if I'm telling you it's better?And  it's not a little better-it's much  better.ELAINE(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.(A knock on the door)JERRYCome in.(Sally enters with a medium-sized box)SALLY(Peppy)Well,here I am!JERRYOh,hi.Elaine,this is Sally.ELAINEHi.JERRYHow was your flight?(Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?SALLY(Setting the box down on his table) Actually,the seat next to me was empty, so,there was no problem at all.JERRY(Let down)Oh..(Starts to open the  box)Oh,wait..(Holding up one of the  BBQ jars)This isn't the sauce that  I asked for!SALLYThat's right.It's a special gourmet  sauce.\"The Pride of Memphis!\"JERRY(Complaining)No,no.I wanted the one  in the little bottle with that guy on  it that looks like Charles Grodin!SALLYThis is much better.And frankly,in  Memphis,we think that other sauce as (Whispering)kind of a joke.JERRYI know it's a joke.It's supposed to  be a joke!Now I'm going on the Charles  Grodin Show with nothing.(Sets the  jar down angrily)Nothing!SALLYYou could just do your material.JERRY(Peeved)I don't have any material!ELAINE(Yelling out)He's got nothin'!(The Coffee Shop)(George is sitting at the table-opposite the doll.While he  eats his meal,he can hear his mother yelling at him via the  doll)DOLLGeorgie!Don't eat with your hands!(George starts eating faster)Why do  you eat so fast?!You can't even taste  it!GEORGE(Losing it)Don't tell me how to eat!(People from near-by tables turn and look at him)DOLLYou're wearing that shirt?You've had  it for five years already!Why don't  you get a new shirt?!GEORGE(Trying to keep it down)Because I like  this one!(Notices people staring at  him,he quickly gets up,collecting  the his coat and the tiny replica)C'mon, let's go.Let's go!(On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking  his path)Oh,hi..(Embarrassed about  the doll,he sheepishly walks out)WOMAN(To Ruthie,the cashier)That man should  really be in a sanitarium.(Ruthie nods, agreeing)(George's old bedroom)(The Maestro,Kramer,and Frank are all pant-less and playing  pool while listening to classical music.Frank is looking at  the Maestro's pictures with a magnifying glass)KRAMERNow this is remarkable.I'm lounging, and yet,my pants remain perfectly creased.FRANKIt's him!(Standing up)It's Carlo Costanza!KRAMERCome on.Are you sure?(They all crowd around the picture)FRANKI'd know him anywhere.MAESTROI've seen that man in Tuscany.Eccentric  fellow.Reputation of being kind of  a village idiot.FRANKI still say we're related.MAESTRO(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh,I love this piece.(Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting  the instruments)KRAMERAlright,come on Frank.It's your shot.FRANK(Complaining)I can't make anything..KRAMER(Like a professional)Well,that's because  you don't know how to follow through  correctly.FRANKFollow through?What do you mean?KRAMERRight here,come on,I'll show you..(Gets behind Frank,holding the pool  stick with him)Take hold of your stick.. alright,bring it back slowly..(Estelle walks in with a tray of beverages and popcorn.Kramer  and Frank continue the lesson in their underwear as she stares  in disbelief)FRANKIt's a little unnatural,but I think  I'm getting the hang of it.ESTELLEOh,my God!(Jerry's apartment)JERRY(Still ticked off)That woman is such  an idiot!I was gonna do this whole  bit on that bottle-and now I got nothing  to talk about.ELAINEWell,have you ever considered writing  new material?JERRYWell,maybe if I didn't have so many  people in my apartment all the time  I'd be able to get some work done.ELAINE(Getting the hint)Me?Are you talking  about me?JERRY(Deeply sarcastic)No.You're never  here.ELAINE(Reflecting)Boy,that doll was really  freaky,wasn't it?JERRYYeah.Really.(Forming and idea)Hey, you know what?Maybe I could talk about  that on the show.ELAINEWhat?JERRYShow the doll-show the picture of  George's mother..it's pretty funny.(Moving toward the phone)I'm gonna  call them.(Scene cuts to George's apartment.Sally answers the ringing  phone)SALLYHello?JERRYHello,Susan?It's Jerry.SALLYHi Jerry,it's Sally!JERRY(Disappointed)Oh.Is George there?SALLYNo,but he should be home soon.JERRYUh,listen,this is important.Tell  him to meet me at the TV studio with  a picture of his mother and that doll  that looks like her.SALLYIs this for your comedy routine?JERRY(Obviously

When you booked the hotel,did youbook it for the millennium New Year?NEWMAN(smug)As a matter of fact,I did.JERRYOh,that's interesting,because as everyone  knows,since there was noyear zero,the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand  and one.Which would make your party,one year late,and thus,quite lame.Newman absorbs the logic of Jerry's argument.His face twitches  as he realiseshis error.JERRYAww!Newman makes a noise redolent of his frustration-a sort of  half-strangulatednasal squeak.He then waddles away after Kramer.(Mrs Hamilton's Apartment)Valerie and Mrs Hamilton sit on the couch.Mrs Hamilton looks  nauseous.MRS HAMILTONI don't feel well at all.I feel all  dried-out inside.VALERIEI'll call for help.She picks up the phone and pushes a button marked 'Poison Control'.(Mrs Hamilton's Apartment/Jerry's Apartment)JERRYHello?VALERIEWho's this?JERRYIt's Jerry.Who's this?VALERIEUh,it's Valerie.JERRYOh,hi Valerie.What's up?VALERIEI'll tell you what's up.My stepmother  is violently ill,so I hit thebutton for poison control and I get you!JERRYWow,poison control?That's even higher  than number one!Valerie hangs up the phone.JERRYHello?THE END>",

Something that would have people talking  at the water coolers.GEORGEWater coolers?CRESPIWe call it a water-cooler show.JERRYBecause the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers  to talk about it,right?GEORGESee,I think people would talk about  it at the coffee machines.JERRYWell it's probably just easier to say  \"water cooler show\" than \"coffee machine  show.\"GEORGEIt's really not accurate.Nobody drinks  from a water cooler any more-they  use bottles.JERRYBut I think Mr.Kimbrough makes a good  point.KIMBROUGHAnyway,Stu here started telling me  about a show,\"Jerry\",that he developed  five years ago.STUI have always loved it.KIMBROUGHHe said it was a show about nothing.

No-drops off the meals and that's  it.I realize we're prisoners,but we're  still entitled to catsup.ELAINEI guess we could've called for help.JERRYBut then we would have missed the whole  thing.KRAMERI still had it on video.We could have  watched it later.GEORGEYeah,he's right.JERRYI forgot about the video.ELAINESure-the video.(Jerry's beeper starts beeping)ELAINEWhat is that?JERRYPlane's ready.(Rivera Live news show)RIVERAHi everybody,I'm Geraldo Rivera.Tonight  we'll be talking about what most of  you have probably beendiscussing in your homes,and around the water coolers in your  offices.I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan  trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham,Massachusetts.Now  before we meet our distinguished panel,let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by.Jane-WELLSYes.Good evening,Geraldo.RIVERAWhat's the mood?What's going on tonight?WELLSWell,Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has  descended upon this quaint little town.RIVERAAnd what about the defendants-the  so-called New York Four.How are they  holding up?WELLSWell,I did speak with one of the deputies  who had some contact with them,and  he told me quote \"There's no love lost  with that group.\"RIVERAAnything else,Jane?WELLSThere also seems to be some friction  between Mr.Seinfeld,and Ms.Benes. The rumor is that they once dated,and it's possible that ended badly.RIVERAWell,ladies and gentlemen,who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer  together.Maybe they'll even end up  getting married.(Jerry's parents are packing)HELENI hope you packed enough-this trial  could last for weeks.MORTYWhat's all that?HELENCereal.MORTYYou're packing cereal?HELENI'm bringing it for Jerry.MORTYYou got enough here for a life sentence.HELENHe likes it.He says he misses that  more that anything.MORTYSo bring a snack-pack.(George's parents are packing)ESTELLEPoor Georgie,was it our fault this  happened to him?Did we do something  wrong?Maybe it was our fault.FRANKMaybe it was your fault.It wasn't my  fault.I can tell you that.ESTELLEOh,so it was my fault,but not yours.FRANKYou were the one who smothered him.ESTELLEI did not smother him.FRANKYou smothered!He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe!He was suffocating!ESTELLESure,and you were always in Korea with  your religious chachkis.FRANKI had to make a living!(Newman,laughing,leaves his building with a suitcase.Uncle  Leo leaves with his bags,followed by J.Peterman,David Puddy  in his 8-ball jacket,Mickey,Kenny Bania,Mr.and Mrs.Ross, Mr.Bookman,Keith Hernandez,and GeorgeSteinbrenner.)(The four are at a table.Jerry and Kramer are enjoying some  cereal,while they wait for Jackie Chiles.)KRAMERThis is excellent huh?Don't worry I  didn't use too much milk,cause I know  we gotta make it last.JERRYYou know I've had to reduce my milk  level.My whole life I've always filled  to at least three quarters-sometimes, to the top of the cereal.Now,to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore.It's  a big adjustment.KRAMERI bet.JERRYIt's one of the hardest things I've  ever had to do.(Enter Jackie Chiles)CHILESGood morning.ELAINEGood morning,Jackie.JERRYGood morning.CHILESIs everybody ready?Didn't I tell you  I wanted you to wear the cardigan?GEORGEIt makes me look older.CHILESLook older?Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is?I'm  trying to give you amoral compass.You  have no moral compass.You're going  to walk into that courtroom,and the  jury's going to see a mean,nasty,evil  George Costanza.I want them to see  Perry Como.No one's going to convict  Perry Como.Perry Como helps out a fat  tub who's getting robbed.(Jerry laughs)CHILESDo you think it's funny?JERRYNo.CHILESYou damn right it isn't.You better  not be carrying on laughing in that  courtroom,funny man.Cause if you start  getting all smart-alecky,making wisecracks, acting a fool,you gonna find yourself  in here for a long,long time.I don't  like that tie.Suzie,get one of my  ties from my briefcase.ELAINEHow do I look,Jackie?CHILESOh,you looking good.You look strong.

The Honorable JudgeArthur Vandelay presiding.GEORGEVandelay?The judge's name is Vandelay?CHILESVanda who?GEORGEJerry,did you hear that?JERRYYeah.GEORGEI think that's a good sign.VANDELAYIs the District Attorney ready to proceed?HOYTWe are,Your Honor.VANDELAYMr.Hoyt.HOYTLadies and gentlemen,last year,our  City Council by a vote of twelve to  two,passed a Good Samaritan Law.Now, essentially,we made it a crime to ignore  a fellow human being in trouble.Now  this group from New York not only ignored, but,as we will prove,they actually  mocked the victim as he was being robbed  at gunpoint.I can guarantee you one  other thing,ladies and gentlemen,this  is not the first time they have behaved  in this manner.On the contrary,they  have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness,self-absorption, immaturity,and greed.And you will  see how everyone who has come into contact  with these four individuals has been  abused,wronged,deceived and betrayed. This time,they have gone too far.This  time they are going to be held accountable. This time,they are the ones who willpay.(Newman shown eating popcorn)VANDELAYMr.Chiles.CHILESI am shocked and chagrined,mortified  and stupefied.This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time  and money.It is a travesty of justice  that these four people have been incarcerated  while the real perpetrator is walking  around laughing-lying and laughing, laughing and lying.You know what these  four people were?They were innocentbystanders.
